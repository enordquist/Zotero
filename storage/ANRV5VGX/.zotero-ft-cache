ABSTRACT: Development of the AMOEBA (atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular simulation) force ﬁeld for proteins is presented. The current version (AMOEBA2013) utilizes permanent electrostatic multipole moments through the quadrupole at each atom, and explicitly treats polarization eﬀects in various chemical and physical environments. The atomic multipole electrostatic parameters for each amino acid residue type are derived from high-level gas phase quantum mechanical calculations via a consistent and extensible protocol. Molecular polarizability is modeled via a Thole-style damped interactive induction model based upon distributed atomic polarizabilities. Inter- and intramolecular polarization is treated in a consistent fashion via the Thole model. The intramolecular polarization model ensures transferability of electrostatic parameters among diﬀerent conformations, as demonstrated by the agreement between QM and AMOEBA electrostatic potentials, and dipole moments of dipeptides. The backbone and side chain torsional parameters were determined by comparing to gas-phase QM (RI-TRIM MP2/CBS) conformational energies of dipeptides and to statistical distributions from the Protein Data Bank. Molecular dynamics simulations are reported for short peptides in explicit water to examine their conformational properties in solution. Overall the calculated conformational free energies and J-coupling constants are consistent with PDB statistics and experimental NMR results, respectively. In addition, the experimental crystal structures of a number of proteins are well maintained during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. While further calculations are necessary to fully validate the force ﬁeld, initial results suggest the AMOEBA polarizable multipole force ﬁeld is able to describe the structure and energetics of peptides and proteins, in both gasphase and solution environments.

■ INTRODUCTION
Proteins are a ubiquitous class of biopolymers, whose functionalities depend on the details of their 3D structures, which are in turn encoded by their speciﬁc amino acid sequences. Computer modeling and simulations are widely utilized in the study of protein structure, function, dynamics, and interactions with other synthetic or biological molecules. In molecular mechanics (MM) approaches, interactions among atoms are described by classical empirical potentials often referred to as force ﬁelds. Unlike ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) methods, the classical MM models treat atoms as rigid particles with electronic degrees of freedom averaged out, thereby lowering the computational cost and allowing simulation of biological events for larger systems and longer time scales. On the other hand, high level ab initio theory is becoming more aﬀordable and is now heavily utilized during the development of classic potentials for proteins, such as Amber,1 CFF,2 CHARMM,3 GROMOS,4 MM3,5 and OPLSAA.6 This class of force ﬁeld typically utilizes ﬁxed atomic charges, point dispersion-repulsion, and simple empirical functions for valence interactions. The current generation of force ﬁeld has enjoyed much success in many areas of biological

and materials science; however, there remains signiﬁcant room for future improvement.
Eﬀorts to advance molecular mechanics force ﬁelds to the “next-generation” have largely focused on introducing explicit electronic polarization into the electrostatic model. A number of comprehensive reviews on the history and development of polarizable force ﬁelds have detailed the signiﬁcance of polarization eﬀects.7−15 A wide range of studies on water,16−18 organic molecules,19−23 peptides,24,25 protein− ligand binding,26−33 ions,34−38 and ion channels39 using polarizable force ﬁelds have demonstrated various beneﬁts of directly treating polarization eﬀects. In addition to oﬀering more accurate thermodynamic properties, a polarizable force ﬁeld is more transferable, in principle, and can be more robustly parametrized by direct comparison with high-level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations in the gas phase.
Several diﬀerent methods for incorporation of many-body eﬀects have been explored. The ﬂuctuating charge approach accounts for polarization by varying the magnitude of atomic charges based on electronegativity equalization.40−47 It has

been argued that ﬂuctuating charge models fail for speciﬁc geometric situations, such as out of plane polarization and bifurcated hydrogen bonding, since charge ﬂow is limited to bond directions.48 Alternatively, the Drude oscillator or shell model, where a point charge moves about the nuclear position, has been applied to modeling of the induced dipole response in water and small molecule systems.17,49−53 Compared to the classical induced dipole method,16,19,48,54−57 these schemes involve less complex numerical algorithms since the point charge framework is retained. However, the interactive atomic induced dipole model58,59 is superior in terms of reproducing anisotropy and nonadditivity of molecular polarization response across many diﬀerent types of compounds. Moreover, intramolecular polarization assumes a critical role upon moving from small molecules to larger peptides and proteins possessing alternative conformational states. The conformational dependence of electrostatics can be signiﬁcant,60,61 and has received attention in the design and development of both polarizable and nonpolarizable force ﬁelds.60,62−64 As we have previously shown,24 the interactive induction model used in AMOEBA can accurately reproduce this property.
In addition to polarization eﬀects, we also want to stress the atomic partial charge-based representation of permanent electrostatics is itself inadequate. It has been shown that the error in a molecular electrostatic potential can be reduced by orders of magnitudes upon complementing atomic monopoles with dipole and quadrupole moments.65−67 The incorporation of higher order atomic multipoles has been shown to greatly improve the quality of crystal structure predictions for simple organic molecules.68,69 One may argue additional oﬀ-center charges are an alternative to point multipoles, as they can enable the same level of ﬁdelity in description of electron density. For example, the use of charges at lone-pair sites of oxygen atoms can improve the ability of a water model to reproduce properties such as the density anomaly with temperature, and the dielectric constant.70 Nevertheless, the determination of both position and magnitude of the charges at such extra sites is a nontrivial task, requiring ﬁtting to the experimental density−temperature proﬁle. In contrast, the distributed multipole analysis of Stone71,72 provides relatively unambiguous sets of atomic multipoles directly from molecular orbital calculations.
In this work, we present the development of a protein potential based upon a polarizable atomic multipole representation of electrostatics. The intramolecular polarization scheme formulated previously allows us to obtain the permanent atomic multipoles, directly from ab initio calculations on blocked dipeptides. A new protocol is applied to combine Distributed Multipole Analysis (DMA) and electrostatic potential ﬁtting to derive conformation-independent “permanent” multipoles. The valence and van der Waals parameters have been derived from liquid simulations of small organic molecules containing similar functional groups. Merging of inter- and intramolecular interactions at short separation, including electrostatics, vdW, and torsional contribution, is determined via comparison to gas phase QM data for di- and tetrapeptides. The resulting potential is examined and validated by dynamics simulation of a number of peptides and proteins in solution and comparison with experimental data. Compared to the preliminary AMOEBA protein force ﬁeld parameters described in a previous article,73 the current paper reports a completely new protein AMOEBA2013 force ﬁeld that is systematically developed using a newly

improved strategy to parametrize permanent electrostatics and torsions, coupled with substantial validation against experimental data.
■ POTENTIAL ENERGY MODEL
The potential energy model has been explained in detail in several previous publications.18,23 Here, we will brieﬂy summarize the key features. The total energy of the system is given by

U = Ubond + Uangle + Ucross + Uoop + Utorsion + UvdW

+ Uepleerm + Ueinled

(1)

The ﬁrst ﬁve terms are the valence contributions corresponding
to the bond, angle, bond-angle cross coupling, out-of-plane, and
torsional energy, respectively. Common functional forms are
used for these terms, and the detailed equations have been given previously.73 Earlier versions of the AMOEBA protein force ﬁeld included a torsion−torsion coupling term, implemented via a cMAP-style74 two-dimensional bicubic
spline. This term is essentially a grid-based correction to match the force ﬁeld ϕ−ψ conformational energies to those of
a target QM-based potential surface. In the current version, however, the “traditional” 3-term Fourier expansion function is
used for all torsion angles, except for the backbone of glycine.
The pairwise additive vdW interaction in AMOEBA is described by Halgren’s buﬀered 14−7 function.75 The buﬀered 14−7 function yields a slightly “softer” repulsive region than the Lennard-Jones 6−12 function, but a steeper repulsive wall than
typical Buckingham exp-6 formulations. For a hydrogen atom
connected to a heavy atom X, the vdW site is placed along the
HX bond such that the distance between the atom X and vdW
site of H is a percentage of the full bond length, referred to as the “reduction factor”. This allows incorporation of some vdW
anisotropy along the bond direction.
The permanent electrostatic energy in AMOBEA arises from
atomic multipole-multipole interactions. Each atomic center
consists of a point monopole (partial charge), a dipole vector and a quadrupole tensor. Note there are only ﬁve independent
quadrupole components due to symmetry and use of traceless moments. The dipole and quadrupole are deﬁned with respect
to local reference frames formed by neighboring atoms.
Examples of such local frames are illustrated in Figure 1. As the molecules rotate and diﬀuse over the course of a simulation, each atom’s atomic multipoles maintain a constant orientation

Figure 1. Local frame deﬁnitions for (a) a protein backbone Cα, (b) backbone amide N, (c) carboxylate carbon, and (d) amine nitrogen. The Cα and amide N use the “Z-then-X” convention, where a ﬁrst neighboring atom is selected to deﬁne the Z-axis, and a second neighbor deﬁnes the ZX-plane and the positive X-direction. The carboxylate example uses the “Bisector” convention, where the bisector of two neighboring atoms deﬁnes Z-axis. This is typically used in
structures with local 2-fold symmetry. The amine N is represented by the “Z-Bisector” convention, where the N−R bond deﬁnes the Z-axis, and the bisector between the two N−H bonds deﬁnes the ZX-plane. In all cases, the Y-axis is then deﬁned according to the right-hand rule.

with respect to their local frame. The equation for calculating interaction energies and gradients (forces and torques) between permanent multipoles, including a traditional Ewald summation method, was presented previously.18
Electronic polarization accounts for the majority of the many-body eﬀects experienced in biomolecular systems although there are situations where many-body aspects of the dispersion and repulsion energies may be important as well.76,77 AMOEBA utilizes an interactive atomic dipole induction scheme where the ﬁeld produced by permanent multipoles and induced dipoles induces a dipole at each polarizable site, and each such induced dipole then further polarizes other atoms. As a result, anisotropic molecular polarizability can be eﬀectively described by isotropic distributed atomic polarizabilities. On the basis of Thole’s model,59 polarization at very short-range is damped, yielding energies in better agreement with ab initio results and avoiding the so-called polarization catastrophe. The same polarization model is used for both intermolecular and intramolecular polarization. A group-based scheme, where permanent multipoles do not polarize other atoms within their group, but induced−induced mutual polarization occurs between all atoms, allow us to merge molecular fragments to represent a larger chain molecule such as a protein. We have previously described the procedure used to extract intramolecular polarization from ab initio quantum mechanical calculations, resulting in “true” permanent atomic multipoles.24 The computation of the polarization energy and gradient in molecules containing multiple polarization groups is detailed in our previous report on the AMOEBA force ﬁeld for general organic molecules.23
The masking of short-range intermolecular interactions is implemented by means of scale factors, which were determined by optimizing the transferability of conformational energies from alanine dipeptide to tetrapeptide, as discussed in the parametrization section. The ﬁnal set of scale factors for interactions between permanent multipoles is 0.4 for the 1−4 interactions (separated by three bonds), 0.8 for 1−5 interactions, and zero (completely neglected) for any closer pair of atoms (1−2 and 1−3 interactions). The polarization energy between induced dipoles and permanent multipole moments is computed fully between atoms separated by three (1−4) or more bonds, and completely neglected for any closer separation. The analytical gradient of the polarization energy is nontrivial because the intramolecular “scaling” used in computing polarization interaction energies diﬀers from the group-based scheme used during induced dipole generation. A derivation of the analytical polarization force resulting from the above masking scheme is detailed in the appendix our previous publication.23
A particle-mesh Ewald (PME) treatment of polarizable multipole interactions has been developed78 and implemented in TINKER,73 Amber,79 and OpenMM80 for AMOEBA calculations. The latest version of TINKER has OpenMP shared-memory parallelization of AMOEBA simulations, AMBER (PMEMD) has the MPI parallel capability, while OpenMM is accelerated for GPU-based calculations. For typical systems, roughly half of the computational expense of AMOEBA is due to iterative calculation of the induced dipoles. For highly charged systems, the relative cost of dipole iteration can be higher (e.g., containing divalent ions). Recently, we have implemented a new induced dipole solver modiﬁed from a conjugated-gradient method,81 which signiﬁcantly improves eﬃciency when tightly converged induced dipoles (<10−5

Debye RMS change) are required. In addition, we have introduced into TINKER a multiple time step (MTS) algorithm for AMOEBA molecular dynamics, in which nonbonded interactions including polarization are updated every 2−2.5 fs. This simple MTS algorithm allows use of longer MD time steps and yields improved computational throughput.
■ COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
Ab initio calculations were performed using Gaussian 0982 and Q-Chem 4.0.83 Geometry optimization was carried out at the MP2/6-31G* level, which is computationally eﬃcient and gives reliable molecular geometries. Initial atomic multipoles for dipeptide model compounds were derived at the MP2/6311G** level using Stone’s original DMA procedure.71 Basis sets containing diﬀuse functions are avoided in the initial DMA determination as they lead to spurious multipole values, especially for buried atoms.84 Note the original DMA procedure can be achieved in the current version of the GDMA program (version 2.0 and above)85 by setting “switch” to 0, and the “radius factor” to 0.65 for all atom types. The resulting atomic multipole values were then optimized against MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ electrostatic potential values computed on a grid of points around each model compound. MP2/aug-ccpVTZ was used because our previous studies indicate inclusion of diﬀuse basis functions is important for capturing intermolecular interactions and reproducing experimental hydration free energy.23 Partial charge values (monopoles) are held ﬁxed during the potential optimization. All single point conformational energies were obtained with complete basis set (CBS) extrapolation from RI-TRIM MP2/cc-pVTZ and ccpVQZ results.86 These CBS calculations provide highly accurate conformational energies while still being computationally aﬀordable. The TINKER, version 6, and Amber, version 10, molecular modeling packages were used for all the molecular mechanics calculations. Particle−mesh Ewald summation78,87,88 was applied to treat electrostatic interactions, including polarization, with a real-space cutoﬀ distance of 7.0 Å, a grid spacing of 0.8 Å, and ﬁfth-order B-splines. A cutoﬀ with a switching window at 12 Å was applied to the vdW interactions. Induced dipoles were iterated to convergence, until the rootmean-square (RMS) change between interations fell below 0.01 D per atom. All molecular dynamics simulations were performed using a Velocity Verlet MTS integration algorithm89 with a 2.5 fs time step. The system temperature was controlled via the Nose−Hoover chain thermostat method.90
For alanine, glycine, proline, and some terminal capping groups (Ala-COOH, Gly-COOH, Gly-COO−), the minimum energy map of the dipeptide was calculated on a uniform 15° grid in ϕ−ψ space. At each of the 576 points, MP2/6-31G* geometry optimization with constrained ϕ and ψ values was performed prior to a single point energy calculation at the RITRIM/MP2 CBS level. For proline, fewer grid points were available for QM calculations because of the limited conformational freedom. For the chain terminal amino acids, a single point ab initio energy was also calculated for each optimized structure using the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) solvation model. The torsion parameters for model compounds were initially ﬁt to gas-phase ab initio conformational energies, and then adjusted to agree with statistical populations sampled from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For the residue side chain torsions, geometry optimization was performed at the MP2/631G* level with each torsional angle constrained at 30°

increments from 0° to 360°, followed by single point RI-TRIM
MP2/CBS energy calculations. The potential of mean force (PMF) of a solvated alanine
tripeptide, NH3+-Ala-Ala-Ala-COO−, with respect to ϕ and ψ angles of the central Ala residue was computed using the two-
dimensional weighted histogram analysis method (2D WHAM).91−93 A total of 576 independent molecular dynamics
simulations of an alanine dipeptide and 206 water molecules in
a 26.6 Å truncated octahedral box were carried out at 298 K,
using the same grid as for the gas phase map. In each simulation, the ϕ and ψ angles were restrained to a grid point
on the Ramachandran map using weak harmonic potentials with a force constant of 0.01 kcal/mol-deg2. The resulting conformer populations, sampled from the 576 × 70 ps
production trajectories were utilized to construct the PMF
and the relative free energy map via the 2D WHAM procedure. An experimentally derived PMF was calculated from −ln(P),
where P is the torsion distribution as sampled from PDB statistics.94 For the alanine backbone, the PDB PMF was
obtained by averaging the data for tripeptides with a central
alanine and either the right- or left-neighboring residue being
alanine (i.e., Ala-Ala-X or X-Ala-Ala, where X represents any
residue type). For proline, PDB data with either a right- or left-
neighbor residue being glycine (i.e., Gly-Pro-X or X-Pro-Gly)
was averaged. Similarly, the glycine PMF was calculated by
averaging the PDB data for Pro-Gly-X and X-Gly-Gly. For peptide systems, including unblocked and protonated
(Ala)5, NH3+-Gly-Pro-Gly-Gly-COO− and Ac-(Ala-Ala-GluAla-Ala)3-NH2, replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD)95,96 simulations were performed using 36 replicas at
temperatures between 278 and 620 K. The (Ala)5 peptide was unblocked, protonated at the N-terminus (−NH3+) and neutral at the C-terminus (−COOH), corresponding to the experimental conditions of pH 2.97,98 For each system, the peptide
was placed in a truncated octahedral box with approximately
800 water molecules. REMD simulations were performed under
the NVT ensemble for at least 30 ns/per replica, using the PMEMD program from Amber 10.79 with snapshots saved
every 0.5 ps for analysis. Protein molecular dynamics simulations were performed
using the Amber10 software package. The proteins simulated include: crambin (PDB 1EJG, 46 residues),99 Trp cage (PDB 1L2Y, 20 residues),100 villin headpiece (PDB 1VII, 35 residues),101 ubiquitin (PDB 1UBQ, 76 residues),102 GB3 domain (PDB 2OED, 56 residues),103 RD1 antifreeze protein (PDB 1UCS, 64 residues),104 SUMO-2 domain (PDB 1WM3, 72 residues),103 BPTI (PDB 1BPI, 58 residues),105 FK binding protein (PDB 2PPN, 107 residues),106 and lysozyme (PDB 6LYT, 129 residues).107 For each system, a single protein
molecule was placed in a truncated octahedral water cell chosen
to provide a minimum distance of 8 Å between protein and cell
wall. Simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble at a
temperature of 298 K. Approximately 10 ns of MD trajectory
were generated for each system. The initial 500 ps portion of
each trajectory was discarded corresponding to equilibration,
and structural information was saved every 0.5 ps during the
subsequent production phase. Analysis of the dynamics
trajectories, including computation of RMSD values and
average structures, was performed via the Amber Ptraj module.79

■ PARAMETER DERIVATION

Article

Electrostatic Parameters. Permanent atomic multipoles

for glycine, alanine and proline residues were derived from

capped Ac-X-NMe dipeptides with X = Gly, Ala, and Pro, with

the goal of deriving conformationally independent electrostatic parameters for the central residue X from QM. A critical ﬁrst step is deﬁnition of intramolecular direct polarization groups

since the intramolecular polarization contribution needs to be

extracted from the DMA multipole values as described in the Potential Energy Model section. Recall that an atom’s

permanent atomic multipoles (PAMs) only polarize atoms

outside its polarization group. Figure 2 shows the group

Figure 2. Illustration of the intramolecular polarization group deﬁnition. Each group consists of a functional group or cluster of atoms with limited conformational ﬂexibility. The permanent multipole moments on each atom only polarize atoms of other groups, while induced dipoles on all atoms polarize all other atoms regardless of group membership.
deﬁnition for alanine. For side chains of other residues, the groups are chosen in the same spirit, that is, no freely rotatable bonds within the group. For example, the −CH2−, phenyl ring, and hydroxyl group are each classiﬁed as a single group for purposes of direct polarization. Next, the initial multipole parameters were derived by via DMA at the MP2/6-311G** level, and these parameters were then optimized against the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ electrostatic potential computed on a set of grid points around the dipeptide compounds. Multiple grid layers were chosen at 0.35 Å intervals, beginning at a 1.0 Å distance from the vdW surface. Multipole parameters are iterated until the RMS diﬀerence from the target QM potential falls below 0.5 kcal/mol, and the RMS gradient is less than 0.5 kcal/mol/Å. Note the point charges are ﬁxed at the original DMA values during the optimization process, while the dipole and quadrupole moments are allowed to relax. The point charges at the boundary between the middle and capping residues, and between the backbone and side chain atoms are then manually adjusted to ensure an integral net charge for each residue. This adjustment is usually very small and the ESP optimization process ensures that charge adjustments are compensated by dipole and quadrupole changes. The resulting PAMs for the central residue are the “conformation independent” PAMs included in the AMOEBA-2013 parameter ﬁle. When connected to other residues in proteins, intramolecular polarization due to the PAMs takes place according to the polarization group deﬁnition. For alanine, we selected ﬁve local minima (αL, α′, C5, C7a, and C7e conformers) and used all ﬁve conformers simultaneously in the above procedure. The multipoles from this multiple-structure potential ﬁtting were used as the ﬁnal set of permanent multipole parameters, and one additional conformer (β2) was used as validation by computing its electrostatic potential and dipole moments with the ﬁnal parameters and comparing to QM results. PAMs for glycine and proline were obtained via an analogous protocol.
For all other residues, capped (Ac-X-NMe) dipeptides were chosen as the model compounds. For each amino acid, three conformations were selected for use in permanent multipole

(monopole, dipole, and quadrupole) parametrization and another three for validation. The conformers have either an extended backbone or represent compact structures with internal hydrogen bonds corresponding to gas phase minima. The backbone atoms were constrained to have the same PAM values as alanine, while side chain PAMs were derived using the procedure outlined above. When the side chain parameters were merged with alanine backbone parameters, charge neutralization (typically on the order of one-hundredth of an electron) was performed at the Cβ atom. Dipole and quadrupole moments were ﬁt to MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ electrostatic potentials for the three conformers in the parametrization set, allowing only the side chain values to vary. ESP ﬁtting and validation results are discussed in detail in the Simulation and Validation section. In addition to Ac (CH3CO−) and NMe (−NHCH3) terminal groups, other N-termini (−NH3+ and −NH2) and C-termini (−COOH and −COO−) were also parametrized. Note glycine requires a separate parametrization for −NH3+ and −COOH termini because of its use of a diﬀerent Cα atom type. Due to the amount of data involved, most parameters, including the PAMs and direct polarization group deﬁnitions, are not given in the text, but are included in the AMOEBA-2013 parameter ﬁles, which are publicly available from the TINKER web site at http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/.
vdW and Valence Parameters. The van der Waals and valence parameters were transferred from the AMOEBA parameters for small organic molecules, as reported in a previous publication.23 The parametrization for these terms follows essentially the approach used for water18 and ions,34 where the vdW parameters were optimized to gas phase cluster structures and energetics as well as condensed-phase properties. A critical strategy in deriving the vdW parameters, due to their empirical nature, is to ensure chemical consistency among diﬀerent elements. This was achieved by simultaneously parametrizing multiple compounds sharing the same vdW “classes” to improve transferability. The “atom classes” (super set of “atom types” used for electrostatics) in AMOEBA are subdivided beyond the simple chemical element types, largely to take into account diﬀerent hybridizations, such as sp2 versus sp3. A selection containing the most common vdW parameters is provided in Table . The valence parameters, including bond, angle, bond-angle cross term and out-of-plane parameters, were transferred from small organic molecules with minor modiﬁcations to improve agreement with ab initio (MP2/631G*) geometries and protein PDB structures.
Torsional Parameters. The valence parameters (bond stretching, angle bending, bond-angle cross terms, out-of-plane bending) were transferred from organic small molecules, which were derived by matching the QM geometry and vibrational frequency of small moelcules.108 The last step was then to derive the torsional parameters by comparing AMOEBA (everything but the to-be-ﬁt torsion) and ab initio conformational energy values. Note that the molecular mechanics conformational energy depends not only on the torsional energy term, but also on the treatment of nonbonded intramolecular interactions − in particular on the treatment of 1−4 interactions across each torsion. In this work, the scaling factors for the intramolecular electrostatic and vdW interactions have been chosen to minimize the contribution of the explicit torsional terms and ensure maximal transferability of parameters between dipeptides and tetrapeptides.
The alanine dipeptide is used to parametrize backbone torsional terms for all amino acids, with the exception of glycine

factor accounts for the distance reduction that moves H vdW sphere oﬀ its nuclear center toward the heavy atom (X) it attaches to. The number represents the percentage of H−X bond length where the H

Figure 3. Gas-phase energy contours for alanine dipeptide from RI-TRIM MP2/CBS calculations (a) and the AMOEBA protein force ﬁeld (b).The energies were computed on a 24 × 24 grid and then contoured.

AMOEBA energy without the ϕ/ψ torsional contribution was
computed for the same conformation, while enforcing torsion constraints. The diﬀerence between AMOEBA and RI-TRIM MP2/CBS energy is taken as the ﬁtting target for the torsional
parameters, using a standard three-term Fourier expansion.
Subsequently 2D WHAM simulations of an Ala-Ala-Ala
tripeptide in explicit water were performed to obtain the Ramachandran potential of mean force (PMF) for the middle
residue. The backbone torsion parameters were further
improved by comparing the AMOEBA PMF in solution to a
statistically derived alanine backbone PMF derived from the PDB database.94 We note that the torsion parameters were not directly ﬁt to the PDB PMF. Instead, the parameter reﬁnement
was achieved by assigning relatively higher weight factors to the
QM energy of gas-phase conformers located in the polyproline II (PII), α-helical and β-sheet regions, while still ﬁtting to the
whole QM gas phase energy map. Torsional parameters were manually reﬁned over 3−4 iterations to balance the relative
populations of solvated peptide in these minimum energy
regions. The gas phase Ramachandran potential energy from RI-TRIM MP2/CBS and AMOEBA with the ﬁnal torsion
parameters are compared in Figure 3. The simulated solution
phase AMOEBA PMF and the PDB-derived statistical PMF
maps for the alanine backbone are shown in Figure 4a. The parametrization of proline backbone torsions followed
essentially the same procedure as for alanine, except that fewer
grid points were used because of the limited conformational freedom. For glycine, a torsion−torsion spline term is introduced in addition to the Fourier torsional terms for ϕ and ψ. After the Fourier torsional parameters were ﬁt to the gas-phase ab initio RI-TRIM MP2/CBS energy, the diﬀerence
between the ab initio and AMOEBA energy was used to determine the torsion−torsion grid based correction table. (See Potential Energy Model for deﬁnition). These 2D values were ﬁxed in the subsequent reﬁnement of the Fourier torsional parameters. Use of the torsion−torsion term improves the ﬁt to
both ab initio data and solution phase properties. Similar to the
parametrization of alanine backbone torsions, the torsional parameters for proline and glycine backbones were reﬁned to
match the statistical PMF for proline and glycine residues in the

PDB database, respectively. REMD simulations were performed with a model tetrapeptide, GPGG (NH3+-Gly-Pro-Gly-GlyCOO−), to obtain the simulated backbone torsion angle distribution of proline and glycine. All other residues share the same backbone torsion parameters (together with valence, vdW, and electrostatic parameters) as alanine. Parameterization of the −COOH C-terminal form of alanine (and other nonGly/Pro residues), and the −COOH and −COO− terminal forms of glycine were ﬁt to RI-TRIM MP2/CBS energies on a 12 × 12 torsional grid. Since there are limited PDB data available for terminal residues, we optimized these parameters by matching AMOEBA energies in implicit solvent (based on Generalized Kirkwood model109) with QM PCM energies at the MP2/6-311G(2d,2p) level.
In addition, conformation energies for a benchmark set of 27 alanine tetrapeptides110 have been assessed. This comparison was made to validate transferability and to adjust the scale factors for short-range intramolecular nonbonded interactions. The AMOEBA results are compared with those from MP2, LMP2, DFT, and RI MP2 calculations in Table 3. All the ab initio calculations are single point energy evaluations at the same HF/6-31G** geometries. AMOEBA calculations were performed with both full geometry optimization, and with ϕ and ψ angles constrained to the HF geometry. All comparison is made against RI MP2/CBS results. While the AMOEBAoptimized structures deviate only slightly from those at HF/631G** (average SRMS = 0.47 Å), the RMS diﬀerence between AMOEBA and RI MP2/CBS energies is 1.15 kcal/mol, similar to those of LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f) and MP2/6-311+G2d2p. Note that the relative conformational energies of the ﬁrst two conformers (extended) versus the third conformer (a compact structure) given by RI MP2/CBS lies between the canonical MP2 and LMP2 results, as do the AMOEBA results. The relative energy of extended and folded conformations is an important measure of the strength of intramolecular dispersion attraction is such systems.
For the side-chain torsions for all other residues, the parameters were obtained by ﬁtting to the RI-TRIM MP2/ CBS conformational energy of the corresponding dipeptides. To derive parameters independent of the backbone con-

formation and to verify the transferability of the backbone torsional parameters for alanine, two or more dipeptide

conformations with backbone ϕ/ψ values ﬁxed at α-helix and β-sheet values were used simultaneously to ﬁt the parameters of side chain χ torsions. For each conformer, the side chain torsional angle of interest was rotated in increments of 30°. At each point, the dipeptide structure was optimized with ϕ, ψ, and χ angles constrained to the same values in both ab initio level and AMOEBA calculations. Examples of conformational energy proﬁles for isoleucine and serine side chains are plotted in Figure 5. The former has an aliphatic side chain, and a single set of torsional parameters performs well across both conformers. The energy order of the local minima is also captured by AMOEBA. The situation for serine is a slightly worse because of the additional complication of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the side chain and backbone. In both cases, the torsional energy contribution accounts for about 15% of the total conformational energy. In Table 2, the average RMS error from the conformational energy ﬁtting for each residue is listed.
■ SIMULATION AND VALIDATION
For small molecules, it is possible to systematically compare force ﬁeld calculations over a range of ab initio data and experimental properties, which allows us to optimize the individual components in the potential energy model, such as the relative contributions from electrostatics and vdW interactions. For larger biomolecules, however, one can only compare detailed simulations with limited data such as database-derived statistical populations, NMR J coupling constants, and atomic structures of native proteins from X-ray or NMR experiments. Such comparison, while absolutely necessary, is most useful for inspecting the torsional parameters, and provides less feedback for other force ﬁeld components (e.g., vdW or electrostatics). It will require more extensive investigation across a wide range of proteins research areas, such as protein folding, ligand binding, pKa shifts and mutant stability, to fully validate the diﬀerent components and aspects of our proposed force ﬁeld. Here, we provide initial results through examination of the electrostatic parameters against QM for multiple conformations of each amino acid in the gas phase, and assessment of peptide conformational properties and protein structures in solution.
Electrostatic Properties in the Gas Phase. One of the important advantages of a polarizable force ﬁeld is its transferability from gas phase to solution. Therefore, it is to our advantage that the gas phase electrostatic properties can be rigorously compared to QM ab initio results. It is especially important to ensure transferability of the alanine backbone electrostatic multipoles to other residues (except glycine and proline), as well as transferability among diﬀerent conformations of each amino acid. We have validated the electrostatic properties of the AMOEBA protein model by computing the x-, y-, and z-components of the dipole moment and the electrostatic potential of dipeptide model compound for each amino acid. For each amino acid dipeptide, three conformations were chosen as the validation set, and these structures were excluded from use in the parametrization process. In Figure 6, we compare the AMOEBA and QM molecular dipole moments of the dipeptide conformers in the validation set. The dipole moment xyz components of all the dipeptides are accurately reproduced, regardless of conformation and residue type, resulting in a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.998. To the best of our knowledge, no other force ﬁeld has demonstrated to be able to represent peptide electrostatic properties at diﬀerent con-

aThis set conformers were used in previous studies.110,86 The RI MP2/CBS and other QM results are taken from taken from ref 86. Two sets of AMOEBA results are listed. Both are from energy minimization of QM structures, one with backbone ϕ/ψ torsional angles restrained at QM optimal

values and the other fully relaxed in the AMOEBA model. The RMSD was computed using RI MP2/CBS energies as the reference.

formations with one set of electrostatic parameters to such accuracy. The comparison between ab initio and AMOEBA electrostatic potential for all dipeptide model compounds is detailed in the Supporting Information, for both the parametrization and validation sets. The average RMSE is 0.45 kcal/ mol per unit charge on a grid surrounding the neutral amino acids, and only slightly higher (0.64) for charged dipeptides, with the absolute value of the potential for the latter being orders of magnitude higher. Thus, thanks to the intramolecular polarization model in AMOEBA, the transferability of backbone and side chain electrostatic multipoles of AMOEBA is quite satisfactory. We believe the test performed here, while not commonly used in force ﬁeld development, is important and necessary for validating the electrostatics of a candidate force ﬁeld model before other components, such as the torsional parameters are empirically adjusted.
Polyalanine Conformational Free Energy in Solution.
Several recent studies have used oligopeptide conformational properties in solution to calibrate force ﬁeld torsional parameters.98,111−117 Simulation results can be directly compared to experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data for the corresponding peptides. Building on this prior work, we have performed a series of simulations on Ala/ Gly/Pro-based peptides using the AMOEBA protein force ﬁeld.
For alanine, we have ﬁrst examined the solvation of the unblocked and protonated (Ala)5 peptide using REMD. Conformational preference is presented as a potential of mean force with respect to ϕ and ψ angles in Figure 4b, which

is calculated from the averaged torsional population distribu-
tions of Ala-2, Ala-3, and Ala-4 residues. A distinct global
minimum is located around the PII conformation. Two other
basins with energies approximately 0.5 kcal/mol higher in energy lie in the β-sheet and α-helix regions. The energy
barriers separating the global basin from the two local minima are about 1−2 kcal/mol. Overall, the upper left region of the Ramachandran map is relatively ﬂat compared to the rest of the
conformational space. The distribution within this highly
populated region of the map agrees well with the statistical PMF drawn from the PDB database (Figure 4c),94 suggesting
transferability of the overall model from (Ala)3 to (Ala)5. The ϕ/ψ torsional angle distributions for (Ala)5 have been
probed experimentally by NMR.98 The spin−spin coupling (Jcoupling) constants reﬂect the ensemble character of the
conformational distribution, and were compared with those
calculated form REMD simulation trajectories of (Ala)5 via Karplus relations.116,118 In total, eight NMR J-coupling constants were reported: ﬁve for the backbone angle ϕ [3J(HN,Hα), 3J(HN,C′), 3J(Hα,C′), 3J(C,C′), 3J(HN,Cβ)], two for the backbone angle ψ [1J(N,Cα), 2J(N,Cα)], and one value for both ϕ and ψ, [3J(HN,Cα)].98 The trajectory at 298K from REMD simulation of (Ala)5 was extracted, and used to compute predicted J-coupling values. Twenty-seven predicted
J-coupling values are compared to those measured by NMR in
Table 4. The J-coupling constants involving the N- and C-
termini were also included. The predicted values are in
excellent agreement with those probed by experiment. The

Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations were performed using 32 replicas at temperatures between 278 and 620 K (30-ns of MD for each replica). The trajectory at 298 K was extracted and used for the J-coupling calculation.

The actual data can be found in the Supporting Information.
chi-square (χ2) diﬀerence between simulation and experiment, computed using the experimental uncertainties,98 is about 0.994, while the overall RMS diﬀerence is 0.33 (Table 4). Note

when using torsional parameters directly ﬁt to the gas-phase QM energy of alanine dipeptide, the χ2 is 3 or 4 times higher. Torsion reﬁnement based on both QM (gas-phase) and the PDB PMF (in solution) thus plays a signiﬁcant role in
improving the calculated J-coupling constants. A notable consequence of the reﬁnement is that the location of the α-
helix population from simulations shifts lower and to the right, toward the average (φ, ψ) angles in the PDB distribution. In contrast, with torsional terms ﬁt to QM gas-phase energies alone, the simulated α-helical population was broader than that from the PDB and centered at a more negative φ and less negative ψ value. A similar eﬀect has recently been discussed for
the CHAMRMM22/CMAP, CHARMM36-MP2, and CHARMM36 force ﬁelds, and it was suggested empirical correction to CMAP approach is important.113,114 Improving agreement with PDB φ/ψ angle distribution in terms of shape
and location, especially for residues not in actual helices, led to thermodynamic properties, and helix−coil transition coopera-
tivity more consistent with experimental data.

minimum about 1 kcal/mol higher in energy than the global
minimum in the PII region (Figure 7a). The simulated
torsional distributions for the Gly-3 residue are also consistent

aggregation and conformational change. The REMD simulation
of the small peptide (Ala)5, described above, provides the sensitive test of the “intrinsic” secondary structure preferences of the AMOEBA force ﬁeld. However, the (Ala)5 peptide is too short to form a stable α-helix, and a more extended PII
backbone conformation is found more favorable than the helix in the Ramachandran free energy map.97,98,116,120−124 We have
further simulated a longer helix-forming peptide, Ac(AAQAA)3-NH2,125,126 to investigate the helix−coil transition. Because the helical population of Ac-(AAQAA)3-NH2 has been determined from NMR chemical shift data,127 we can directly
compare the AMOEBA helical-fractions calculated from REMD simulations. We use the same deﬁnition of the helical state as a previous study,97 namely, φ in the range [−160°, −20°] and ψ in [−120°, 50°]. The fraction of helix was evaluated as the
frequency of the individual residues existing in the helical states during the whole trajectory at 303 K. Figure 8 shows the fraction of helix, ⟨hi⟩, for each residue from our simulation and NMR chemical shift data. Reasonable agreement is seen
between the simulated values and those obtained from NMR experiments at 303 K, where both ﬂuctuated between 10 to
30% for most residues. The error was estimated using block
averages derived from six 5-ns simulation windows. In addition,
the lower helical propensity trend at the C-terminus was well
captured, while AMOEBA seems to underestimate the helix
fraction for residues 3, 4, and 7. Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Protein Systems.
Ten well-studied proteins were chosen as the validation set to
evaluate the new parameters. While limited, this set is representative of several diﬀerent types of protein structures.
For example, Trp cage (1L2Y) and villin headpiece (1VII)
mainly consist of alpha helices; GB3 domain (2OED) and FK binding protein (2PPN) contain a signiﬁcant proportion of β
sheet structure; crambin (1EJG) and lysozyme (6LYT) are disulﬁde bond-rich domains; the remaining proteins are mixtures of diﬀerent motifs.
The stability of each protein was characterized by its backbone RMSD value relative to the PDB structure over 10
ns MD simulation, as summarized in Figure 9. The overall
average RMSD of the ten simulated protein structures is 1.33 Å, and seven of them are close to 1.0 Å. The ﬁnal MD trajectory
snapshot for each protein is superposed on its PDB structure in
Figure 10. We can see that helical and sheet motifs are well maintained, and do not signiﬁcantly drift from the experiment
structures. For many of the proteins, the large deviations arise
from the terminal regions. For example, inspection of the PDB entry for ubiquitin shows the ﬁnal ﬁve residues have signiﬁcantly higher temperature factors than the rest of the
molecule. Flexibility near the C-terminus is also observed in the
MD results, particularly for the two glycine residues at positions
75 and 76. Elimination of just these two residues from the data
analysis results in a backbone structural RMSD of 1.16 Å
against the PDB structure. Calculation of NMR Order Parameters. The order
parameter (S2) indicates the ﬂexibility of each residue, with lower S2 values corresponding to greater ﬂexibility. We have
compared simulated order parameters for ubiquitin and hen egg white lysozyme to NMR relaxation experiments128,129 which measure the relaxation of amide 15N−1H dipolar interaction.130,131 Relaxation is caused by ﬂuctuations of interaction
energies as the internuclear interaction vectors are reoriented
by thermal motion, and therefore allows the observation of anisotropic local residue motions.132 The isotropic reorienta-

tional eigenmode dynamics (iRED) matrix was extracted from the MD trajectories, and order parameters (S2) were then computed from the eigenvalues of this matrix.133
Figure 11 compares of S2 values computed from the 10 ns
MD simulations with the corresponding NMR measurements. The calculated and experimental S2 curves are generally well-
correlated; the RMSDs between the two sets of values are 0.04
and 0.12 for ubiquitin and lysozyme, respectively. For ubiquitin, the high ﬂexibility near turn 1 (residues 7−10), turn 3 (residues 37−40), turn 6 (residues 62−65), and the C-terminus was nicely reproduced. For lysozyme, ﬂexibility at turn 1 (residues 46−49), long loop 2 (residues 61−78), loop 3 (residues 85− 89), loop 4 (residues 100−107), loop 5 (residues 116−119),
and the termini are in general agreement, although the
computed values are somewhat higher than experiment. All
the large deviations come from loop residues exposed to water. Speciﬁcally, the greater ﬂexibility than what the experimental
order parameters have indicated seems to suggest that the
interactions between the 48D/61R and 101D/103N were
underestimated by the model. However, the same types of residues give reasonable S2 values at other sites in lysozyme and
ubiquitin. Additional evidence is necessary to decide whether

we need to and how to improve the parameters for these residues. But overall, the AMOEBA force ﬁeld appears able to reproduce protein structures and ﬂexibilities.
Calculation of Side Chain J-Couplings. Amino acid side
chain distributions were evaluated by comparing the simulated
side chain J-couplings to the experimental NMR values for four
protein systems: BPTI, GB3 domain, ubiquitin, and hen egg lysozyme.129,134−137
Table 6 shows the side-chain RMSD between the
experimentally derived and simulation-based scalar couplings.
Also listed for comparison are the RMSD values obtained from the Amber ﬀ99SB force ﬁeld and Amber ﬀ99SB-ILDN,138 which were reﬁned against the side chain NMR data of the four
proteins. Note the side chain parameters for AMOEBA were directly from ﬁtting to QM energy proﬁle and were not
optimized against the experimental data. Overall, the performance of AMOEBA force ﬁeld is comparable to Amber ﬀ99SB-
ILDN. Although a few outliers are evident for each protein
system, most of the experimental scalar couplings are
reasonably reproduced. The correlation between the calculated
and experimental J-couplings of all the four protein systems is summarized in Figure 12. The overall R2 correlation coeﬃcient
is 0.75. Details of the J-coupling values for each protein can be
found in the Supporting Information. Within high scalar-
coupling regions, AMOEBA failed to distinguish subtle diﬀerences observed in experiments. For example, most AMOEBA-predicted J-coupling values were ∼10.8 Hz, while
experimental data range from 8.0 to 15.0 Hz. We further
subdivided the RMSD values by amino acid residue. The values ranged from ∼0.7 to 3.3 (Figure 12). For residues with
relatively high RMSDs, like Ile and Gln, we did not attempt force ﬁeld modiﬁcations since the sample size for these residues
is small in the four proteins studied. The side chain J-coupling

data suggests the AMOEBA force ﬁeld, derived from gas-phase QM energy proﬁles, reasonably captures side chain conformational properties in solution. Further improvement would require additional reliable experimental data for individual residue types.
■ CONCLUSIONS
The development and parametrization of the AMOEBA-2013 protein force ﬁeld is been reported. A distinct feature of the force ﬁeld is its use of atomic multipole-based electrostatics and explicit treatment of dipole polarization. A mutual induction model with Thole damping is applied to describe both intraand intermolecular polarization in a consistent manner. The polarization among permanent multipoles is handled via a group-based scheme while induced−induced dipole polarization occurs among all polarizable sites. By extracting the intramolecular polarization as deﬁned by the force ﬁeld, we are able to derive conformation-independent electrostatic multipole parameters from high-level ab initio calculations using a combination of distributed multipole analysis and electrostatic potential ﬁtting. This rigorously derived electrostatic model will be important for accurate description of protein interactions with other biomolecules as well as electrostatic forces within protein molecules.

After determination of vdW parameters, largely obtained by transferred from liquid simulations of small organic molecules,23 the AMOEBA model was applied to simulation of several peptides and proteins. In addition to the nonbonded electrostatic and vdW forces, the “torsional” energy also plays an important role in setting relative conformational energies. The torsion term is essentially an error function in most classical force ﬁelds, and yet it plays a crucial role in determining the detailed conformational properties of peptides and proteins. Recent improvements to the Amber111,138 and CHARMM force ﬁelds113,114 have demonstrated that conformational populations of small peptides are extremely sensitive to subtle changes (involving fractions of a kcal/mol) in the torsional parameters. In developing the AMOEBA force ﬁeld, we have resorted to both high-level ab initio (MP2/CBS) peptide energetics and PDB structural statistics in deriving the backbone torsion parameters. The resulting force ﬁeld performs well in the reproduction of NMR J coupling constants and S2 order parameters of several peptide and protein systems. Nonetheless, these are limited validations focusing on conformational properties and torsional parameters. Further extensive investigations involving more proteins and a broad range of thermodynamic properties will be necessary to fully explore various aspects of the potential energy model, and to determine the overall success and possible deﬁciencies of the force ﬁeld.
As previously noted,113,139 a CMAP-style splined 2D torsional potential allows a force ﬁeld to reproduce gas-phase ab initio conformational energies exactly. Such CMAP terms may also exacerbate unphysical features in the rest of the force ﬁeld and therefore are not transferable. For example, the QM and force ﬁeld diﬀerence could result from an incorrect valence energy bin classical force ﬁeld at extremely stressed conformations, an eﬀect which has little to do with the “torsion” energy. We plan to revisit use of CMAP correction terms in the future. However, with the exception of Gly, we have removed such terms from the AMOEBA-2013 protein model. While we have strived to derive a balanced and physical force ﬁeld, better understanding of the limitations of molecular mechanics force ﬁelds is essential for continued systematic improvement. Accurate modeling of short-range electrostatic and vdW components, as well as their coupling to valence interactions, will be the key to achieving still greater accuracy and transferability in a future protein force ﬁeld that performs well in various physical and chemical environments.
