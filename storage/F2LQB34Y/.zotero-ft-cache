PAPER

Effect of cosolvents on nano-conﬁned water: a molecular dynamics study†
Payel Das*
Received 9th January 2012, Accepted 21st February 2012 DOI: 10.1039/c2nr30070b

We present results from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the effects of cosolvents, such as urea and guanidinium (Gdm) salts, on the water conﬁned in hydrophobic carbon nanotubes. We observed complete drying of the nanotube interiors of diameter ranging from 8 to 17 A  in urea. In contrast, the water population within nanotube cores smaller than 12 A  remains unaffected in GdmCl solution, whereas larger nanotube interiors become partially dehydrated with prevailing presence of stable Gdm+–Gdm+ dimers. The molecular arrangement and the lifetime inside the nanotube were found to be characteristics of a particular cosolvent. In both urea and GdmCl solutions, preferential cosolvent intrusion resulting in nanotube dehydration is driven by the stronger dispersion interaction of cosolvent than water with the nanotube. The partial drying of the hydrophobic core is attributed to guanidinium’s better hydration and weaker self-association propensity compared to urea, as well as to its moderate ion-pairing with strongly hydrated chloride ions. The Gdm+ induced dehydration varies with the charge density of counter-ions, as the presence of high charge-density sulfate ions impedes penetration of guanidinium, and consequent dehydration of the nanotube. These ﬁndings provide important insights into the effect of cosolvents on the nano-conﬁned water in a hydrophobic environment.

Introduction
The unique properties of nano-conﬁned water have been a subject of immense interest over the past few years,1–3 as such systems are ubiquitous in nature. Conﬁned water is relevant in many phenomena, ranging from protein folding4,5 and functions6 to clay swelling7 and frost heaving in soil.8 Studies of nanoconﬁned water can also aid the development of new nano-devices in aqueous environments.9 The highly unusual properties of conﬁned water originate from the weak interaction with the conﬁning wall combined with the local ordering of the hydrogenbonding network imposed by the conﬁnement.1 Conﬁned water can thus have different structure, dynamics, and phase diagram than bulk water.9–17
Investigation of conﬁned mixtures also reveals interesting modiﬁcations in the bulk-phase diagrams.18–22 Such knowledge is important, since many cosolvents naturally occur in cellular environments. At the same time, conﬁning effects on water can be critical for modulating the function of many biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA strands, and lipid bilayers. In fact, nanoconﬁned water is vital for functions of ion channel23 and chaperone6 proteins. Well deﬁned hydrogen-bonded solvent

molecules buried inside the hydrophobic core are found in some proteins that are needed for their function.24,25 Thus, a detailed characterization of conﬁned binary mixtures can provide a better understanding of conﬁning effects in a cellular environment. In addition, such information is also relevant for practical applications, such as gas storage26 and selective drug delivery.27
Recently, we have studied the effect of urea on the water occupancy of carbon nanotube interiors.28,29 Carbon nanotubes serve as a model and easily controllable system for providing a clear quantitative picture of the nano-conﬁned solvent in a nonpolar medium.30 Our simulations revealed preferential occupation of urea molecules leading to dehydration of hydrophobic nanotube interiors in 8 M aqueous urea. In this study, we focus on understanding how the physicochemical nature of a particular cosolvent affects nano-conﬁned water. For this purpose, we have performed simulations of nanotubes immersed in aqueous urea and guanidinium (Gdm) salt solutions.
Gdm+ is a planar, bulky cation with low charge density. On the other hand, urea is less polar than Gdm+, has no net charge, and can form hydrogen bonds with each other. Both urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) are widely used as protein denaturants, whereas guanidinium sulfate is a protein stabilizing agent. Given the distinct chemical nature of urea and Gdm+, we here characterize the differences in terms of their effects on the conﬁned water inside hydrophobic nanotubes. Preferential cosolvent intrusion resulting in dehydration of the nanotube core in both urea and GdmCl solution was observed; however, the extent of dehydration is notably different.

is provided that accounts for such differential effects of urea and GdmCl. The effect of counter-ions on nanotube–Gdm+ interaction is also explored. We hope that these results will provide a better understanding of cosolvent induced changes of the nanoconﬁned water in a non-polar cavity.

Simulation details
The initial coordinates of single-walled nanotubes (CNTs) were generated using the nanotube builder plugin of VMD software. We used (6, 6), (8, 5), (9, 6), (10, 8), and (17, 8) CNTs to study nanotubes with diameters ranging from 8.1 A  to 17.3 A  (Table S1†). The length of CNTs varies from 1.35 to 3.3 nm (see Table S1†).
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, 50–150 ns long, were run for an individual nanotube solvated in a cubic box of pure water, 8 M urea, 6 M aqueous GdmCl, and 6 M aqueous Gdm2SO4 solutions (see Fig. S1†). The CHARMM22 (ref. 31) (parameter set c32b1) force ﬁeld and TIP3P water model were used in this study. The parameters for guanidinium cation used here were taken from the standard CHARMM parameters for arginine (see Table S2†). We kept the position of the nanotube restrained by applying a harmonic constraint. The MD simulations were performed at 300 K in an NPT ensemble using the NAMD2 molecular modeling package32 with a 2 fs timestep. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions. Full electrostatics was evaluated at every timestep. A cutoff distance of 12 A  was used to directly calculate the short-range electrostatic interactions. The particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method was used for the long-range electrostatic interactions. The van der Waals (vdW) interactions were treated with a cutoff distance of 12 A  and a switching function to smoothly truncate the vdW potential energy at the cutoff distance. All simulations were run using an IBM BlueGene/L supercomputer. The simulations of (6, 6), (8, 5), and (9, 6), solvated in 6 M GdmCl, were run for 50 ns. For the systems containing larger CNTs [(10, 8) and (17, 8)], the simulation length was equal to or longer than 100 ns. For comparison among results obtained for different CNTs, the number of solvent molecules was normalized with that for a 3.3 nm long CNT (Fig. 1).
Results and discussions
Comparison of urea- and GdmCl-induced changes of nanotube core hydration
Our simulations of the CNTs with diameter (d) smaller than 12 A  in 6 M GdmCl revealed no change in nanotube core hydration compared to that in pure water (Fig. S1†). This result is in contrast to the behavior of urea molecules, in which urea preferentially penetrates inside CNTs with d ranging from 8 to 17 A . The core of a larger (10, 8) CNT with d > 12 A  experiences remarkable increase in the Gdm+ population (Fig. 1, top). The interior of the (10, 8) CNT, the smallest one experiencing a locally enhanced population of Gdm+, is consistently ﬁlled with $7 Gdm+ molecules after 24 ns (at t ¼ 0 ns, the number of Gdm+ was 4). Thus, the local concentration of Gdm+ within the core becomes higher than 6 M: the water–Gdm+ ratio within the CNT averaged over all frames obtained during 100 ns MD is $3.8, which is signiﬁcantly lower than in bulk ($5.4). Similar behavior

is observed for the (17, 8) CNT (Fig. 1, Bottom). This observation clearly demonstrates the preferential intrusion of Gdm+ into a purely hydrophobic interior.
Clearly, there are marked differences between urea and GdmCl in terms of cosolvent population and the resulting dehydration observed within a hydrophobic core. Urea completely dehydrates the nanotube interior with a diameter of 8–17 A , whereas in GdmCl solution partial drying was observed only for larger CNTs with d > 12 A .

nanotube. This observation is in agreement with previous simulations performed by Jungwirth and coworkers, which have shown pairing of guanidinium faces that are strongly waterdepleted.33 The presence of homo-ion dimers inside all nanotubes simulated in this study is evident also from the radial density proﬁles of cosolvents (Fig. S2†). The existence of homo-ion dimers presumably restricts intrusion of Gdm+ in smaller nanotubes. In addition, there is a clear preference in their orientation with respect to the nanotube axis, as indicated by the probability distribution of the angles formed between Gdm+ molecules and a (10, 8) nanotube. Two peaks are evident in the distribution, one around 20  and a second one around 160 , which implies that the planar faces of Gdm+ tend to orient either to the nanotube walls and/or to the ﬂat face of another Gdm+ ion. Each Gdm+ inside the nanotube is hydrated in its molecular plane and forms hydrogen bond(s) with 1–2 water molecules, in line with its very weak hydration property compared to other cations.34 On the other hand, urea molecules appear to self-aggregate inside the CNT by N–H/O hydrogen bonding with no preferential orientation with respect to the nanotube (Fig. 2). This feature allows them to form a single-ﬁle urea chain and dehydrate even smaller nanotubes.
Both Gdm+ and urea not only populate the interior of the CNT core, but also accumulate near the outer surface of all CNTs. Urea accumulation near the outer surface of the CNT is also much higher than that of Gdm+. As a result, the water– cosolvent ratio is $1.6 in urea solution near the outer surface, signiﬁcantly lower than what is found in aq. GdmCl ($3.2) for a (10, 8) CNT.
While single-ﬁle transport of water and small organic molecules has been extensively investigated through simulations,1,12,35,36 transport through larger CNTs largely remains unexplored. In this context, Goddard and coworkers have recently reported the thermodynamic picture of water conﬁned in nanotubes with diameters from 0.8 nm to 2.7 nm. Water within a 1.2 nm (10,8) CNT stays in an enthalpy-stabilized ice-like phase, whereas in larger CNTs (diameter larger than 1.4 nm) water remains bulk-like.14 We here characterize the kinetics of water as well as of both cosolvents inside nanotubes by

computing their residence times (lifetimes). Fig. 3 shows the cumulative distributions Presidence (t < s) of the lifetime s of urea, guanidinium, and water molecules inside the nanotube. Clearly, both cosolvents stay much longer than water inside the nanotube, with maximal lifetimes of urea, guanidinium and water being 92 ns, 100 ns and 13 ns, respectively. In general, urea molecules have long lifetimes inside a nanotube due to their high aggregation propensity. However, there is a clear crossover at a higher residence time of $65 ns due to stable Gdm+–Gdm+ dimers that stay notably longer than the single guanidinium molecules inside the nanotube. Similar results were found for a (17, 8) nanotube (Fig. S3†).
A common dispersion interaction driven mechanism for cosolvent-induced drying of nanotubes
The primary driving force of the observed phenomenon can be evaluated by calculating the loss/gain of energy (both electrostatic and dispersion) for each guanidinium and water molecule in the ﬁrst solvation shell (<5 A ) of CNT while moving to the nanotube core. For this purpose, the interaction energy of each water–guanidinium molecule with the environment was estimated during the ﬁrst 2 ns of the MD, long before water and the Gdm+ population inside a (10, 8) nanotube reaches equilibrium (see Fig. S4†). We found that the loss in electrostatic interaction energy with the rest of the system for each Gdm+ is $2.8 kcal molÀ1 as the ion moves toward the CNT. At the same time, each water molecule loses $3.0 kcal molÀ1 in electrostatic interaction energy while approaching CNT. Thus, clearly the electrostatic interaction cannot be the driving force for the preferential occupancy of Gdm+ within the nanotube. On the other hand, there is a signiﬁcant stabilization in the vdW interaction energy for Gdm+ ($5.9 kcal molÀ1) compared to water ($1.8 kcal molÀ1) as it moves near the CNT (Fig. S4†). Thus, each Gdm+ gains about 3.1 kcal molÀ1 (À5.9 + 2.8 kcal molÀ1) on average as it penetrates the CNT, while each water loses about 1.2 kcal molÀ1 (À1.8 + 3.0 kcal molÀ1) for the same process. This result clearly demonstrates that both Gdm+ and urea penetration into the nanotube core are primarily driven by vdW interaction energy, consistent with previous ﬁndings revealing attractive dispersion interactions of urea37 and Gdm+ 38 with hydrophobic polymers/ plates.
This driving force with stronger vdW interactions can also be seen from the interaction energy of each water–Gdm+ molecule with a (10, 8) nanotube (CNT only in this case; there is only vdW interaction energy present between the neutrally charged CNT and cosolvent–water) (Fig. 4). The interaction energy of a urea molecule with the (10, 8) CNT immersed is also shown for comparison. Both guanidinium and urea form stronger dispersion interaction with the nanotube than water ($À2.5 kcal molÀ1). The average CNT–Gdm+ vdW interaction energy ($À11.7 kcal molÀ1) within the core is slightly higher than the CNT–urea vdW interaction energy ($À10.6 kcal molÀ1). The average CNT–chloride dispersion interaction energy is $À3.5 kcal molÀ1. In the current study, the carbon atoms of the nanotubes were modeled using the CHARMM parameters for the aromatic carbon. The strong dispersion interaction of guanidinium with aromatic carbon atoms found here is consistent with the recent report by Mason et al., which has shown

preferential interaction of Gdm+ with aromatic cosolutes over aliphatic cosolutes.39 The stronger interaction with nanotube, along with the presence of stable homo-ion dimers, allows guanidinium to stay longer than urea inside nanotube cores.

Chemical nature of the cosolvent determines the hydration of nanotubes
From the Ow–Ow and Ow–Hw radial distribution functions (RDFs) and Hw–Ow hydrogen bond distance distributions (Fig. S5†), it appears that both urea and guanidinium have little effect on the structure and hydrogen bonding of water, consistent with previous simulation data.40,41 A noticeable change in the Ow–Ow RDF is observed in the region 3 A  < r < 7 A  in GdmCl solution, while the ﬁrst coordination shell and the hydrogen bonding of water remain unperturbed. This change is similar to the pressure induced perturbation of the tetrahedral water structure reported in the literature.45 Nevertheless, the distinct dehydration of nanotubes in urea and GdmCl solutions can be explained in terms of their inherent chemical nature, as discussed below.
There are clear differences between two cosolvents in terms of hydration and self-association propensity, as evident from the cosolvent–cosolvent and cosolvent–water pair RDFs (Fig. 5). Urea has much higher propensity to self-associate than Gdm+, whereas Gdm+ is better hydrated than urea in bulk water, due to its ionic character and H-bonding interactions with water. Fig. 5 further shows that urea hydrogens make weaker hydrogen bonds than Gdm+ with water, which is evident from a reduced peak height and the peak shifting to larger distance. A similar conclusion can be obtained also from the probability distributions of hydrogen bond distances between Gdm+–water and urea–water (Fig. S5†). Gdm+ hydrogens form strong hydrogen bonds with water oxygens closely mimicking water–water hydrogen bonds, as manifested by the position agreement of the ﬁrst peak in the O–H RDF (Fig. 4) as well as in the hydrogen bond distance distributions (Fig. S5†). This stronger hydrogen bonding with water could be attributed to the higher negative

charge on nitrogens of Gdm+ (À0.8) than those of urea (À0.62). The better hydration of Gdm+ compared to urea elucidates the incomplete drying of the nanotube core in the aqueous GdmCl solution, which is augmented by the presence of strongly hydrated ClÀ ions (see below).
Effect of counter-ions on Gdm+ accumulation inside nanotubes: ClÀ vs. SO42À
The (10, 8) nanotube core was found to be ﬁlled with 5–7 ClÀ ions (Fig. 1); however ClÀ ions enter the core following Gdm+ due to their moderately attractive (ionic and hydrogen bonding) interactions with guanidinium cations.42 To evaluate the inﬂuence of anions on modulating the interaction of guanidinium with the nanotube, we have also simulated nanotubes in aqueous Gdm2SO4 solution that is known as a protein stabilizing agent. Sulfate is positioned further left of the Hofmeister series and has higher charge density than chloride. Sulfate stabilizes proteins, whereas chloride is essentially neutral. Our simulations show that the presence of sulfate ions completely impedes penetration of guanidinium ions, and consequent dehydration, within the (10, 8) nanotube (Fig. 6). Interestingly, in this case Gdm+ leaves the nanotube following sulfate. The preferential exclusion of sulfate from the hydrophobic nanotubes is due to its higher tendency to form hydration complexes that reside away from hydrophobic surfaces. Such a tendency of sulfate ions can lead to

Furthermore, the Gdm+-induced dehydration varies with the charge density of counter-ions, as the presence of high chargedensity sulfate ions impedes guanidinium-induced dehydration. These results suggest that the water population in a non-polar nano-conﬁnement can be modulated by addition of cosolvents. Since many cosolvents naturally occur in cellular environments, our results might aid toward a better understanding of nanoconﬁned water in biological systems including proteins in vivo.

increased hydrophobic interaction compared to pure water, which is purely an entropic effect.43 In addition, stronger pairing of Gdm+ with sulfate,44 compared to that with chloride, leads to preferential exclusion of Gdm molecules from hydrophobic nanotubes. This observation that hydration of a hydrophobic core remains unaffected in Gdm2SO4 solution is likely associated with its protein stabilizing ability.
Conclusions
This study provides a quantitative comparison of urea and GdmCl induced changes on the hydration of a hydrophobic nanotube core, which is primarily driven by the stronger dispersion interaction of the cosolvent than water with the hydrophobe. As revealed in our study, the water population of nanotube cores with diameters smaller than 12 A  in GdmCl remains unaffected, as the core cannot accommodate Gdm+ homo-ion dimers. In contrast, nanotube cores with diameters ranging from 8 to 17 A  are exclusively dehydrated in urea. A purely hydrophobic nanotube core with a diameter larger than 12 A  is primarily populated by fully dehydrated nano-size urea aggregates. The same nanotube core also experiences higher local concentration of GdmCl within; however, it is only partially dehydrated due to better hydration and lower self-association tendency of Gdm+ than urea. Stable Gdm+–Gdm+ dimers are found inside all nanotubes with diameters larger than 12 A . The molecular arrangement and the lifetime inside the nanotube were also found to be characteristics of a particular cosolvent.
