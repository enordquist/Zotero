characterizing the functional SAPs. In such a demanding era, biology has to rely on bioinformatics, which can work its way through to solve the problems at hand by cutting huge amount of time and resources that are otherwise wasted. Here, we describe an overview of the existing repositories of variant databases and computational methods in predicting the effects of functional SAPs on protein stability, structure, function, drug response, and protein dynamics. This chapter will inspire many biologists with a greater promise in identifying the functional SAPs at the structural level, thereby understanding the molecular effects that are critical for personalized medicine diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment for diseases.

1. INTRODUCTION
Technological advances in high-throughput research have modernized the whole field of biology and medicine with the introduction of terms like genomics, proteomics, pharmacogenomics, and epigenomics. The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004) and HapMap project in 2007 (Frazer et al., 2007; The International HapMap Consortium, 2003) followed by initiation of 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) and the Exome Sequencing Project has led to deposition of large volume of genetic variation information in public databases. Numerous efforts were underway in understanding the effects of genetic variation between the individuals and consequences in phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility (De Baets et al., 2012; Taillon-Miller, Gu, Li, Hillier, & Kwok, 1998). The DNA variation consists of insertions, deletions, copy number variations, and single nucleotide substitutions (SNPs). Change in a single nucleotide base from any one of the four nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) to another one is termed as single nucleotide substitution and is found to be the most common DNA variation (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012). SNP alleles are created either by transition (C/T or G/A) or transversion (C/T, A/G, C/A, or T/G) substitutions. All of these transition and transversion events appear to be more or less similar in occurrence, except for the extreme overabundance of the C to T transition. Over 70% of all the SNPs found in the human genome involve a C to T transition (Kimura, 1980). So far 11 million SNPs have been cataloged; among them 7 million SNPs are designated as common variants occurring with a minor allele frequency above 5%, while the remaining SNPs with minor allele frequency below 5% are designated as rare variants

(Frazer, Murray, Schork, & Topol, 2009; Raychaudhuri, 2011). SNPs are not only designated as markers for constructing genetic maps but also have the potential to direct functional polymorphic variants that are involved in monogenic and complex disorders such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Understanding the involvement of functional SNPs might shed some light in disease susceptibility to monogenic and complex disorders and also help in designing more effective treatments to individuals by monitoring adverse drug effects. SNPs are classified based on the location within coding sequences of genes, in noncoding regions of genes, or in the intergenic regions between genes (Risch, 2000). Maximum numbers of SNPs are found in noncoding regions without any biological function of a protein (silent), though they may affect gene expression or splicing. An SNP in which nucleotide substitution leads to no change in amino acid sequence is termed as synonymous (silent mutation), whereas substitution of nucleotide that leads to alteration in the amino acid sequence is defined as nonsynonymous (missense or “nonsense mutations”) also called as single amino acid substitutions (SAPs) (Mooney, 2005; Stenson et al., 2003). SNPs within coding or regulatory region of a gene are of biological significance (Pastinen, Ge, & Hudson, 2006). Tennessen et al. (2012) estimated the occurrence of 13,000 exonic SNPs per person, of which 58% are nonsynonymous. Among the class of SNPs, SAPs are of broad research interest due to their accountability in causing half of the known gene lesions responsible for human inherited diseases (Krawczak et al., 2000; Stenson et al., 2003). Therefore, these SAPs are classified as deleterious ones, which have an impact on protein function, thereby leading to dramatic phenotypic change (Sunyaev et al., 2001; Wang & Moult, 2001; Yue & Moult, 2006). However, majority of the SAPs were hypothesized to be neutral or tolerant SAPs, which do not contribute to any phenotype (Masso & Vaisman, 2010; Ng & Henikoff, 2006; Shastry, 2006a, 2006b). Differentiation of deleterious from neutral or tolerant SAPs is very essential in characterizing the genetic basis and pathogenesis of human disease in medical genetics, thereby able to access individual susceptibility to disease (Dimmic, Sunyaev, & Bustamante, 2005). SAPs affect the functional roles of proteins in signal transduction of visual, hormonal, and other stimulants (Dryja et al., 1990; Smith et al., 1994) in gene regulation by altering DNA and transcription factor binding (Barroso et al., 1999), and in maintaining the structural integrity of cells and tissues (Thomas et al., 1999). SAPs inactivate functional sites of enzymes or alter splice sites and thereby form defective gene products ( Jaruzelska et al., 1995; Yoshida, Huang, & Ikawa, 1984).

SAPs may affect drug–receptor or drug–enzyme interactions by inducing structural change in receptors or active target-enzyme sites (Bonnardeaux et al., 1994; Erdin, Ward, Venner, & Lichtarge, 2010; Rignall et al., 2002; Ung, Lu, & McCammon, 2006; Vatsis, Martell, & Weber, 1991), ion channels (Wang et al., 1996), and proteins involved in the detoxification pathways (Hassett, Aicher, Sidhu, & Omiecinski, 1994). Furthermore, SAPs may destabilize proteins, or reduce protein solubility (Proia & Neufeld, 1982), and also have functional effects on transcriptional regulation, by affecting transcription factor binding sites in the promoter or intronic enhancer regions (Prokunina & Alarcon-Riquelme, 2004), or alternatively splicing regulation by disrupting exonic splicing enhancers or silencers (Cartegni & Krainer, 2002).
To understand the mechanism of phenotypic variations due to SAPs, it is important to measure the structural consequences due to change in amino acid residue. A well-known classical example is sickle-cell anemia, studied by Sir John Kendrew 55 years ago, which results from the substitution of V instead of E in sixth position of the beta chain of hemoglobin reducing the solubility of the deoxygenated form of hemoglobin markedly (Stryer, 1995). Several studies have illustrated the importance of SAPs in affecting cellular function in the variety of ways. It includes occurrence of SAPs in the active sites (Stevanin et al., 2004; Yamada et al., 2006) or surrounding amino acid residue involved in ligand binding or amino acid residue involved in contact with surrounding proteins will alter the function of the protein. When an SAP occurs near the active site, it might alter the characteristic of the catalytic groups (Koukouritaki et al., 2007; Takamiya, Seta, Tanaka, & Ishida, 2002; Zhang, Norris, Schwartz, & Alexov, 2011; Zhang, Wang, et al., 2010). This will alter the kinetic properties (optimum cellular environment) such as pH, temperature, and salt concentration (Alexov, 2004; Fujiwara et al., 2000). Furthermore, these SAPs can affect the protein stability (Dobson, 2003; Gromiha, Oobatake, Kono, Uedaira, & Sarai, 1999; Ode et al., 2007; Shirley, Stanssens, Hahn, & Pace, 1992; Wang & Moult, 2001), protein flexibility (Karplus & Kuriyan, 2005; Song et al., 2005; Tang & Dill, 1998; Young, Gonfloni, Superti-Furga, Roux, & Kuriyan, 2001), protein folding (Dobson, 2003; Thomas, Qu, & Pedersen, 1995), solvent accessibility (Gromiha et al., 1999; Karchin, Diekhans, et al., 2005; Karchin, Kelly, & Sali, 2005; Kleina & Miller, 1990; Rennell, Bouvier, Hardy, & Poteete, 1991; Rose & Wolfenden, 1993; Stitziel et al., 2003), secondary structure elements (Chasman & Adams, 2001; FerrerCosta, Orozco, & de la Cruz, 2002; Gromiha & Ponnuswamy, 1993;

Saunders & Baker, 2002), protein aggregation (Board, Pierce, & Coggan, 1990; Keage et al., 2009; Valerio et al., 2005; Wong, Fritz, & Frishman, 2005), protein–protein interaction (Akhavan et al., 2005; Dixit, Torkamani, Schork, & Verkhivker, 2009; Hardt & Laine, 2004; Jones et al., 2007; Ma, Elkayam, Wolfson, & Nussinov, 2003; Ortiz, Light, Maki, & Assa-Munt, 1999; Ozbabacan, Gursoy, Keskin, & Nussinov, 2010; Rignall et al., 2002; Teng, Madej, Panchenko, & Alexov, 2009; van Wijk, Rijksen, Huizinga, Nieuwenhuis, & van Solinge, 2003; Zhang et al., 2011), protein–DNA interaction (Elles & Uhlenbeck, 2008; Venkatesan et al., 2007; Wright & Lim, 2007), subcellular localization (Boulling et al., 2007; Castella et al., 2011; Hanemann, D’Urso, Gabree¨ls-Festen, & Mu¨ller, 2000; Kim, Hyrc, et al., 2011; Kim, Kim, et al., 2011; Laurila & Vihinen, 2009; Moosawi & Mohabatkar, 2009), protein expression (Boulling et al., 2007; Hanemann et al., 2000), and posttranslational modifications (Grasbon-Frodl et al., 2004; Radivojac et al., 2008; Ryu et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2004; Tolkacheva et al., 2001; Vazquez, 2000; Vogt et al., 2007). These mounting studies imply the varying functional role of SAPs, which can have a large effect on an organism or species. It is assumed that SAPs in the protein sequences that are observed among living organisms have survived natural selection. Population genetic studies describe that a significant fraction of functional SAPs was present in the highly conserved regions. Residues that evolve under strong selective pressure are found to be significantly associated with human diseases (Arbiza et al., 2006). Disease-causing or deleterious mutations are most likely to correspond to evolutionarily conserved positions in protein sequence due to their functional importance (Tavtigian et al., 2006; Thusberg & Vihinen, 2009). Generally, functional consequences of SAPs fall into two types, namely, disease-associated (deleterious) and benign (no observable phenotypic effect) (Bao & Cui, 2006). The researches of structural and evolutionary features that discriminate the two classes of SAPs have many important applications. First, such features will help to identify disease-associated SAPs from the majority of benign SAPs and to reveal the molecular background of genetic diseases (Karchin, Kelly, et al., 2005). Second, such features will help to determine crucial residues and to elucidate the sequence–structure– function paradigms for individual proteins (Murphy, Barrantes-Reynolds, Kocherlakota, Bond, & Greenblatt, 2004; Wang & Moult, 2003). Finally, such features can be used to guide the selection of target sites in artificial mutagenesis experiments (Dambosky, Prokop, & Koca, 2001). Importantly, SAPs result in altered protein products, which might lead to change in

drug–target phenotypes and thereby cause dysfunction of drugs. Moreover, SAPs may produce altered effects in drug transporters, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and drug–target proteins (Ingelman-Sundberg, Sim, Gomez, & Rodriguez-Antona, 2007; Tomalik-Scharte, Lazar, Fuhr, & Kirchheiner, 2008; Zhou et al., 2009), which results in variability of patient–drug responses. To address this, gaining a detailed understanding of the effect of genetic variants on patient–drug response and underlying mechanism is a key part in the establishment of personalized medicine (Fernald, Capriotti, Daneshjou, Karczewski, & Altman, 2011; Rodriguez-Casado, 2012).
Knowledge of a protein’s three-dimensional (3D) structure is not only used for energy calculations but also necessary for a full understanding of a mutational effect on its functionality (Capriotti & Altman, 2011), drug– target interaction, and the relationships between mutations and drug response (Lahti, Tang, Capriotti, Liu, & Altman, 2012; RodriguezCasado, 2012; Weigelt, 2010). To understand the structure–function relationship, it is necessary to map a mutation onto known protein 3D structure, which acts as a powerful tool in revealing the mechanistic explanation of their effects on function. Proteins with mutations do not always have 3D structures that are solved and deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB). Therefore, it is necessary to construct 3D models using homology modeling by locating the variation in 3D. This acts as a powerful tool to reveal what kind of adverse effects a mutation can have on protein. This process of detailed structural analysis of protein–drug interactions was not always feasible in the past, but advances in structural genomics have resulted in an explosion of high-resolution structures of known and potential drug–target proteins.
The last decade has witnessed a drastic increase in genomic information, especially SNPs in public databases and lends itself to an informatics approach. Bioinformatics, especially computational molecular biology, is playing a vital role in extracting knowledge from the vast amount of genomic information generated by different genomics technologies. As a result, various computational resources were developed to aid identification and characterization of the functional SAPs and to study the impact of SAPs in protein, patient–drug response, and current therapeutic targets. In this chapter, we intend to provide an overview of the existing computational methods in SAP analysis available on the World Wide Web. Summing up, the techniques presented in this chapter will build a bridge between computational methods and clinicians toward personalized medicine in tailoring new treatment strategies.

2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN SAP ANALYSIS
With the ever-increasing influx of high-throughput technologies and the pronounced ascendency of the Human Genome Project (HGP), the scientific communities of disease research and drug design have witnessed a paradigm shift toward single amino acid substitutions (SAP). With a successfully completed genome, genome-wide association studies were initiated using SAPs as markers to study disease–gene associations. The commonality of SAPs in a genome makes them suitable detection points for studying disease susceptibility (Curtis, North, & Sham, 2001). The last decade has witnessed extraordinary advances in experimental and computational technologies to identify, characterize, and differentiate pathogenic SAPs from neutral ones. Traditional methods find a unique place in disease diagnosis and treatment of an individual. Employing traditional methods for SAPs analysis will consume precious time, require increased labor, and thus often turn detrimental to the study itself. Computational techniques with cutting edge software and innovative algorithms are fast improving the arduous task of analyzing genetic polymorphism data. This will serve as a powerful screening process to single out potentially deleterious SAPs from the whole stack and examine it as a possible drug–target through stability studies (Mah & Chia, 2007). Increased deliberation in this regard led to the generation of numerous algorithms and methods to provide an edge to the study of SAPs. Many computational methods were developed to predict whether an SAP is deleterious to the structure or the function of the gene and will, therefore, lead to disease. These predictions of SAP are of three classes: (1) predict the effect on protein function, (2) predict the effect based on the pathogenicity, and (3) predict the effect on protein structure stability. Researchers have taken many input features such as sequence-based properties, physical properties of the wild-type and mutant amino acids, protein structural properties (solvent accessibility, location within beta strands or active sites, and participation in disulphide bridges), and evolutionary properties derived from a phylogeny or sequence alignment to predict an SAP as deleterious/disease/pathogenic/intolerable/nonneutral or neutral/ tolerable. To classify whether an SAP will be tolerable, a training set is usually constructed of mutations known to be deleterious. For example, these training sets can be derived from saturation mutagenesis experiments, where the mutation severity is determined in activity assays (Cai et al., 2004;

Chasman & Adams, 2001; Krishnan & Westhead, 2003; Ng & Henikoff, 2001; Saunders & Baker, 2002), multiple sequence alignments where tolerance to mutation is derived from evolutionary analyses of sequence positions (Sunyaev et al., 2001), or known deleterious human mutations. In this chapter, we have provided a brief classification and description of some well-known reliable SAP prediction methods available to this day. For the accurate description of the process of SAP analysis, we have provided a pictorial representation of the entire process in Fig. 10.1.
The computational prediction methods can be divided into four most important families of algorithms: machine-learning methods, empirical rule-based methods, physics-based models, and evolutionary theory-based models to classify SAPs. Machine-learning approaches develop classification models that automatically learn from the training data, extract patterns from complex data, and make predictions of new cases. Random forests (Bao, Zhou, & Cui, 2005; Li et al., 2009; Mathe et al., 2006), neural networks (Bromberg & Rost, 2007; Ferrer-Costa et al., 2005; Linding, Russell, Neduva, & Gibson, 2003; Yang, Thomson, McNeil, & Esnouf, 2005), Decision Trees (Yuan et al., 2006), support vector machines (Calabrese, Capriotti, Fariselli, Martelli, & Casadio, 2009; Capriotti & Altman, 2011; Capriotti et al., 2013; Capriotti, Fariselli, & Casadio, 2005; Capriotti, Fariselli, Rossi, & Casadio, 2008; Karchin, Kelly, et al., 2005; Mathe et al., 2006; Parthiban, Gromiha, Hoppe, & Schomburg, 2007; Tian et al., 2007; Yue & Moult, 2006), naive Bayes approach (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Schwarz, Rodelsperger, Schuelke, & Seelow, 2010), hidden Markov models (Mi, Muruganujan, & Thomas, 2013; Shihab et al., 2013), and rulebased methods (Kumar, Henikoff, & Ng, 2009; Ramensky, Bork, & Sunyaev, 2002; Reva, Antipin, & Sander, 2011; Tavtigian et al., 2006; Zhou & Zhou, 2002) are among the most widely used machine-learning methods for SAP analysis. Few meta-analysis suite tools are also available, which combine the prediction information from the abovementioned prediction methods ( Jegga, Gowrisankar, Chen, & Aronow, 2007; Lee & Shatkay, 2008; Olatubosun, Valiaho, Harkonen, Thusberg, & Vihinen, 2012; Schaefer, Meier, Rost, & Bromberg, 2012; Wang, Ronaghi, Chong, & Lee, 2011) and SAP prioritization tools (Conde et al., 2004; Freimuth, Stormo, & McLeod, 2005; Lee & Shatkay, 2008; Wjst, 2004; Xu et al., 2005). The abovementioned methods use several different inputs such as NCBI GI number OR RefSeq ID, wild-type protein FASTA sequences, and wild and new residue after mutation (single-letter amino acid code) for making their predictions. In order to quantify the destabilization

effects of SAPs, the protein stability change upon mutations can be evaluated by calculating the difference in folding free energy change between wildtype and mutant proteins (DDG or ddG) without performing any experimental results (Capriotti et al., 2005; Chen, Lin, & Chu, 2013; Cheng,

SAP prediction tools can be classified for better understanding into sequence-, structure-, and sequence- and structure-based methods.

3. DATABASE RESOURCES FOR SAPs
As of November 7, 2013, about 62,676,337 SNPs of Homo sapiens were identified and deposited in the major repository National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (Sherry et al., 2001) (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_summary.cgi?viewþsummary ¼viewþsummary&build_id¼138). In addition, there are now a few other extensive databases that provide information about the DNA variations. This includes UniProt database (Apweiler et al., 2010), ClinVar database (Maglott et al., 2013), human genome variation database, HGVBase (Fredman et al., 2002), Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) (Stenson et al., 2012), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (Amberger, Bocchini, & Hamosh, 2011), and MutDB (Mooney & Altman, 2003). Repositories like dbSNP and UniProt contain information about the experimentally proved SAPs, but a few of these are annotated with respect to function. OMIM contains disease-related literature information; HGMD contains disease variants with one or more references in the literature, and ClinVar database contains clinically significant variant information. The availability of a comprehensive SNP catalog offers the possibility of identifying many disease loci and eventually pinpointing functionally important variants in which the nucleotide change alters the function or expression of a gene that directly influences a disease outcome. The study of the distribution of SNPs particularly in different populations is also valuable for investigating molecular events that underlie the evolution, namely, genetic drift, mutation, recombination, and selection. These illustrate important changes in human history, for example, tracing the origin of populations and their migrations. In addition, disease-specific databases were initiated to specifically collect variant information pertaining to one disease (Basu, Kollu, & Banerjee-Basu, 2009; caBIG Strategic Planning Workspace (caBIG), 2007; George Priya Doss, Nagasundaram, Srajan, & Chiranjib, 2012; Ingman & Gyllensten, 2006; Nuytemans, Theuns, Cruts, & Van Broeckhoven, 2010; Ruiz-Pesini et al., 2007) and in defining the molecular basis of the disease (Giardine et al., 2007; Kawabata, Ota, & Nishikawa,

1999) and structural stability (Gromiha et al., 1999). In addition, visualization tools were developed to analyze the effect of SAP on protein structure along with conservation and physicochemical properties (Chang & Fujita, 2001; Han et al., 2006; Luu, Rusu, Walter, Linard, et al., 2012; Luu, Rusu, Walter, Ripp, et al., 2012; Uzun, Leslin, Abyzov, & Ilyin, 2007; Venselaar, Te Beek, Kuipers, Hekkelman, & Vriend, 2010). Several researchers have reviewed in detail about the computational methods and also compared the performance of each computational method over the other existing methods, which are available online (Castellana & Mazza, 2013; Frousios, Iliopoulos, Schlitt, & Simpson, 2013; George Priya Doss, Rajasekaran, Arjun, & Sethumadhavan, 2010; George Priya Doss & Sethumadhavan, 2009a, 2009b; George Priya Doss et al., 2008; Gnad, Baucom, Mukhyala, Manning, & Zhang, 2013; Gray, Kukurba, & Kumar, 2012; Khan & Vihinen, 2010; Peterson, Doughty, & Kann, 2013; Reumers, Schymkowitz, & Rousseau, 2009; Thusberg, Olatubosun, & Vihinen, 2011; Tiffin, Okpechi, Perez-Iratxeta, Andrade-Navarro, & Ramesar, 2008; Wang, Eickholt, & Cheng, 2010; Wang, Sun, Akutsu, & Song, 2013).

4. MOLECULAR PHENOTYPIC EFFECT ANALYSIS
SAPs can alter the biophysical properties of amino acid residues such as size, charge, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic contacts, disulfide bonds, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions at critical folding positions, which will have an impact on residue contacts and thereby lead to loss of protein stability as well as folding, flexibility, and aggregation of the protein (Betz, 1993; Dill, Ozkan, Weikl, Chodera, & Voelz, 2007; Eriksson et al., 1992; Horovitz, Serrano, Avron, Bycroft, & Fersht, 1990; Pace et al., 2011). Most often the change in protein stability results in increased propensity for protein aggregation. As a consequence, SAPs can have a considerable effect in the solubility and aggregation propensity of a protein (Karplus & Kuriyan, 2005; Keage et al., 2009; Valerio et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2005). Several computational algorithms have been proposed to predict the aggregationnucleating sequences in proteins using either sequence-based or structural bioinformatics tools (Conchillo-Sole et al., 2007; De Baets et al., 2012; Fernandez-Escamilla, Rousseau, Schymkowitz, & Serrano, 2004; Garbuzynskiy, Lobanov, & Galzitskaya, 2010; Maurer-Stroh et al., 2010; Trovato, Seno, & Tosatto, 2007; Tsolis, Papandreou, Iconomidou, & Hamodrakas, 2013; Van Durme et al., 2009). SAPs also introduce disorder

predisposition in a target protein, which may affect the protein conformation, increase the flexibility, and lead to alterations in function. SAP effects on structural disorders can be analyzed by providing a sequence as the input (Cheng, Randall, Sweredoski, & Baldi, 2005; Cheng, Sweredoski, & Baldi, 2005; Doszta´nyi, CsizmLok, Tompa, & Simon, 2005; Galzitskaya, Garbuzynskiy, & Lobanov, 2006; Ishida & Kinoshita, 2007, 2008; Linding, Russell, Neduva, & Gibson, 2003; Prilusky et al., 2005; Sickmeier et al., 2007; Vullo, Bortolami, Pollastri, & Tosatto, 2006). There are significant numbers of reports that explain the involvement of missense mutations in posttranslational target sites leading to diseases (Grasbon-Frodl et al., 2004; Radivojac et al., 2008; Vogt et al., 2007). Posttranslation modification sites (PTMs) are implicated in many cellular processes and have a vital role in regulating the functional and structural properties of protein (Walsh, 2006). Different PTMs of known protein like phosphorylation, glycosylation, methylation, acetylation, and sumoylation can be analyzed by various computational methods (Blom, Sicheritz-Ponten, Gupta, Gammeltoft, & Brunak, 2004; Chang et al., 2009; Gupta et al., 1999; Huang, Lee, Tseng, & Horng, 2005; Kiemer, Bendtsen, & Blom, 2005).

5. SEQUENCE INFORMATION ANALYSIS
Protein primary sequence provides the most direct and readily available information regarding the clues for functional mutation sites that can be extracted from the amino acid sequence in cases where no structural information is available. Population genetic studies describe that a significant fraction of functional SAPs was present in a conserved region. Residues that evolve under strong selective pressure are found to be significantly associated with human diseases (Arbiza et al., 2006). The importance of residue for maintaining the structure and function of a protein can usually be inferred from how conserved it appears in a multiple sequence alignment of that protein and its homologues. A comparative analysis of amino acid conservation from multiple species by protein sequence alignments gives an indication of which amino acid residues are truly conserved and which of them represent localized evolution. It is assumed that SAPs in the protein sequences that are observed among living organisms have survived natural selection. Disease causing, or deleterious mutations are most likely to correspond to evolutionarily conserved positions in protein sequence due to their functional importance (Tavtigian et al., 2006; Thusberg & Vihinen, 2009). Several methods were made available online predict the conservation

analysis of multiple sequence alignments (Ashkenazy, Erez, Martz, Pupko, & Ben-Tal, 2010; Berezin et al., 2004; Gu & Vander Velden, 2002; Pupko, Bell, Mayrose, Glaser, & Ben-Tal, 2002; Siepel et al., 2005). ConSurf (Ashkenazy et al., 2010) is a tool based on comparative analysis of amino acid conservation from multiple species by protein sequence alignments and provides an indication of which amino acid residues are truly conserved and which of them represent localized evolution. There is extensive research indicating the function of substituted amino acids in causing diseases (Dobson, Munroe, Caulfield, & Saqi, 2006; Khan & Vihinen, 2007; Vitkup, Sander, & Church, 2003) and Trp and Cys residues in determining protein stability (Arbiza et al., 2006). Few studies have illustrated the importance of Cys residues in a protein sequence since most of the protein foldings are dependent on disulfide bonds (Song, Geng, et al., 2009; Song, Lim, & Tong, 2009). SNP-associated residue changes to or from Cys will likely destabilize the protein structure. Composition of each amino acid can be calculated by statistical analysis of protein sequences (Brendel, Bucher, Nourbakhsh, Blais-dell, & Karlin, 1992; Cheng et al., 2006). Solvent accessibility, considered as a discriminating feature in disease-associated SAPs, tends to occur at buried sites; benign substitutions tend to occur at solvent accessible sites (Ferrer-Costa et al., 2002; Sunyaev et al., 2001). Solvent accessibility from an exposed to buried state could be considered functionally significant in the mutant protein at the structural level (Chen & Zhou, 2005), which can be accessed by ACCpro (Pollastri, Baldi, Fariselli, & Casadio, 2002), WHAT IF (Vriend, 1990) and WESA (Chen & Zhou, 2005). Secondary structure elements can be analyzed using NetSurfP-1.1 (Petersen, Petersen, Andersen, Nielsen, & Lundegaard, 2009), Jpred (Cole, Barber, & Barton, 2008), YASPIN (Lin, Simossis, Taylor, & Heringa, 2005), STRIDE (Heinig & Frishman, 2004), DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983), and SSPro (Cheng, Randall, et al., 2005; Cheng, Sweredoski, et al., 2005).

6. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR STRUCTURE DETERMINATION
As of November 2013, PDB contains 95280 entries (Bernstein et al., 1997) of experimentally solved structures, which includes multiple structures of the same protein, while UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot contains 541561 sequence entries (Apweiler et al., 2004) and NCBI RefSeq database contains 33,139,144 protein entries (Pruitt, Tatusova, Brown, & Maglott, 2012).

Due to the advent of cost-effective high-throughput gene sequencing technologies, the number of sequence entries in the aforementioned databases is increasing. Furthermore, the number of solved structure determination will tend to increase; the number of newly discovered sequences grows much faster than the number of structures solved (Levitt, 2007). The protein structures are solved by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and high-resolution molecular microscopy (EM). These methods of structural determination are limited by cost, time consumption, and requirement of specialized instruments, which leads to a large gap between the solved structures and available protein sequences in the databases. Due to this, the application of computational-based methods in 3D structure predictions has increased and also become a valuable resource in defining protein function (Hermann et al., 2007) and studying the impact of mutation at structural level (George Priya Doss, Chakraborty, Rajith, & Nagasundaram, 2013; Kosinski, Hinrichsen, Bujnicki, Friedhoff, & Plotz, 2010) and drug discovery (Liu, Tang, & Capriotti, 2011). Existing computation methods for structure determination fall into two categories (Zhang, 2008a, 2008b): templates-based comparative (or homology) and threading methods, which utilize structures of known homologous proteins as starting templates (Kolinski, Rotkiewicz, Ilkowski, & Skolnick, 1999; Rost, Fariselli, & Casadio, 1996), and free modeling methods (de novo and ab initio), which apply the principles of physical chemistry in protein folding, often in combination with efficient fragment searching techniques ( Jothi, 2012; Lesk, 1997; Zemla, Venclovas, Reinhardt, Fidelis, & Hubbard, 1997). These computational structure prediction methods were discussed in detail (Kryshtafovych & Fidelis, 2009; Pierri, Parisi, & Porcelli, 2010; Werner, Morris, Dastmalchi, & Church, 2012; Zhang, 2009). In this section, we have discussed the steps followed in homology modeling. In template-based methods, the tertiary structure of an unknown protein can be modeled using a known 3D structure of protein with the homologous sequence (homology modeling), while, in fold recognition, the protein structure was modeled based on the proteins with known structures having the same fold but no homology to the proteins with known structure (Daga, Patel, & Doerksen, 2010; Mart´ı-Renom et al., 2000; Qu, Swanson, Day, & Tsai, 2009). Homology modeling uses only sequence similarity, whereas fold recognition uses both structure and sequence relationship. Homology modeling consists of four major steps: (a) template identification, (b) alignment of target sequence with template structures, (c) model building, and (d) model evaluation.

Template identification is one of the most important steps in homology modeling, which is performed by searching the target sequence in databases such as PDB, which includes solved structures. The commonly used searched methods BLAST (Altschul, Gish, Miller, Myers, & Lipman, 1990), FASTA (Lipman & Pearson, 1985; Pearson & Lipman, 1988), PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), HHSearch (Koehl & Delarue, 1994), HHpred (So¨ding, Biegert, & Lupas, 2005), and Phyre (Kelley & Sternberg, 2009) provide a ranking of templates along with “E-value” alignment scores. A good candidate template is selected based on the E value equal to zero, with the highest similarity and a template of solved structures by X-ray crystallography. A sequence identity cutoff of 30% is considered as the standard threshold in homology modeling. In the case of low identity, Doolittle (1986) formulated three rules for template selection: sequences longer than 100 amino acids with <25% identities (with gaps) are probably related; sequences with 15–25% identity might be related (“twilight zone”) but need additional statistical analyses to help establish this with confidence; sequences with 15% identity are most likely not related. Choosing multiple templates can improve the quality of the model when compared to use a single template (Fernandez-Fuentes, Rai, Madrid-Aliste, Fajardo, & Fiser, 2007; Kosinski, Tkaczuk, Kasprzak, & Bujnicki, 2008; Wallner, Lindahl, & Elofsson, 2008). Once a final template is selected, target-template alignment should be performed by using unique pair-wise or multiple sequence alignment tools such as Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011), T-Coffee (Notredame, Higgins, & Heringa, 2000), ClustalW2 (Larkin et al., 2007), 3DCoffee (O’Sullivan, Suhre, Abergel, Higgins, & Notredame, 2004), and Muscle (Edgar, 2004). Tress, Jones, and Valencia (2003) proposed that inclusion of regions sharing highest sequence similarity along with common motifs can be considered as correctly aligned because they tend to be evolutionarily conserved. Additional sequence information, localization of hydrophobic regions, secondary structure elements, and disulphide bonds are considered to improve alignment. The next step in homology modeling involves model building, where a 3D structure model is built based on the given targettemplate alignment and template structures. Nowadays, this procedure has become fully automated. Basically, model building methods are grouped as follows (Wallner & Elofsson, 2005; Xiang, 2006): rigid-body assembly methods, which build a model from the structurally conserved regions of the template that align to the target sequence, like 3D-JIGSAW (Bates, Kelley, MacCallum, & Sternberg, 2001), BUILDER (Koehl & Delarue, 1995), and SWISS-MODEL (Arnold, Bordoli, Kopp, & Schwede, 2006);

380

C. George Priya Doss et al.

segment matching methods like SegMod/ENDCAD (Levitt, 1992); spatial restraint methods like MODELLER (Eswar et al., 2006); and artificial evolution methods like NEST (Petrey et al., 2003). A spatial restraint method utilizes satisfying restraints such as bond lengths and angles, van der Waals contact distances, and dihedral angles to map onto the target-template structure alignments. Studies comparing the model building methods have rated MODELLER as the best among the existing model building methods (Dalton & Jackson, 2007; Wallner & Elofsson, 2005). Model evaluation remains as the fundamental and most important step in homology modeling and in defining whether the model created is of good quality. The error in homology structure comes from the side chains and loops. For this, many approaches including hybrid methods have been proposed to rectify these errors (Arnold et al., 2006; Das & Baker, 2008; Deane & Blundell, 2001; Fernandez-Fuentes, Zhai, & Fiser, 2006; Holm & Sander, 1992; Hwang & Liao, 1995; Koehl & Delarue, 1994; Krivov, Shapovalov, & Dunbrack, 2009; Lee & Subbiah, 1991; Liang, Zheng, Zhang, & Standley, 2011; Rohl, Strauss, Misura, & Baker, 2004; Samudrala & Moult, 1998; Sippl, 1993; Xiang, Soto, & Honig, 2002; Xu & Berger, 2006). Additionally, many model quality assessment programs are made available, which define a scoring function that is capable of discriminating good and bad models (Bowie, Lu¨thy, & Eisenberg, 1991; Davis et al., 2007; Hooft, Vriend, Sander, & Abola, 1996; Laskowski, MacArthur, Moss, & Thornton, 1993; Lu¨thy, Bowie, & Eisenberg, 1992; Sippl, 1993; Wiederstein & Sippl, 2007). Threading methods can be used in place of homology modeling, when template structures share less than 30% sequence identity with the target sequence with evolutionary relationship (Miller, Jones, & Thornton, 1996; Xu, Li, Kim, & Xu, 2003). The structures that are not modeled by homology modeling and threading can be performed using free modeling servers (Das et al., 2007; Jayaram et al., 2006; Kim, Chivian, & Baker, 2004; Kinch et al., 2011; Rohl et al., 2004; Wang, Yang, Li, Liu, & Zhou, 2010; Zhang, 2008a, 2008b; Zhang, Wang, et al., 2010). The abovementioned structure prediction methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, and their consistency varies for each structural problem. Choosing appropriate methods depends mainly on the availability of a suitable template and computational resources.

7. DOCKING
All the drugs presently available in the market have gone through years of clinical research and drug trials ( Jorgensen, 2004). Even a single disease

can have many options for a drug. It is estimated that a typical drugdiscovery cycle, from lead identification to clinical trials, can take 14 years with a cost of 800 million US dollars before it can be sold in the market to the general public. It takes the scientists even longer to finally select that one “potential” drug from among the many other options. Rapid advancements in the fields of genomics, proteomics, and biotechnology have fuelled the drug-discovery process. This constant expansion has led to the approval of 18 drugs for human use by the US Food and Drug Administration, with approximately four acting on novel target structures (Rask-Andersen, Almen, & Schioth, 2011). In spite of this success, an “efficacy–effectiveness gap” exists and is, ultimately, the result of variability in patient–drug responses. Also, marketed drugs exhibit limited efficacy of about 30–60% (Sadee & Dai, 2005; Wilkinson, 2005) and may also exhibit drug toxicity (Wilke & Dolan, 2011) toward the patient. Drug discovery and drug research have contributed more to the progress in the field of medicine than any other scientific factor. Many studies have highlighted that drug discovery and designing is a complex, highly expensive, risky, and quite cumbersome process (Congreve, Murray, & Blundell, 2005; DiMasi & Grabowski, 2007; DiMasi, Grabowski, & Vernon, 2004; DiMasi, Hansen, Grabowski, & Lasagna, 1991; Kolb & Sharpless, 2003). The drug-discovery process aids in designing a candidate drug or lead compound, which binds with the target-specific protein whose function is thought to be essential for the disease phenotype. The traditional drug-discovery process involves three major steps: target identification and validation, lead identification, and lead optimization. This process is expensive and takes a very long time in identifying the drug. Modern drug discovery involves application of computational methods in an efficient manner to predict drug–target interaction, stability, and activity. Bioinformatics, through various tools and techniques, can eliminate the numerous drug choices to just 10 drugs or even fewer. Virtual screening is the screening of many compounds that might dock with a particular target macromolecule and lead to the formulation of a potential drug (Taboureau, Baell, Ferna´ndez-Recio, & Villoutreix, 2012). It is a high-throughput screening of millions of compound databases in the hopes of finding a unique compound or a drug that can replace an existing drug or that can shed light on diseases with no drugs. All the compounds that are screened do not necessarily exist (Lavecchia & Di Giovanni, 2013). Millions of compounds can be screened easily without having to spend much time, effort, or money. Virtual screening can be divided into two broad categories: ligand-based and structure-based. There

382

C. George Priya Doss et al.

are stringent rules that have to be followed in virtual screening. Many in silico tools can be used to design libraries of compounds with drug-like properties (Villoutreix et al., 2007). These are predominantly biophysical properties based on empirical rules. A well-known example is Lipinski’s “rule of five” (Lipinski, 2000), which states that a compound is likely to be “nondruglike” if it has more than 5 hydrogen bond donors and more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors; molecular mass is greater than 500 and lipophilicity is above 5. New pharmacokinetic data found in rats have caused this rule to be revisited (Ridder, Wang, de Vlieg, & Wagener, 2011). Many related rules have been subsequently modified and proposed as the “rule of three” (Rees, Congreve, Murray, & Carr, 2004), which defines fragment properties with an average molecular weight 300 Da, a Clog P  3, the number of hydrogen bond donors 3, the number of hydrogen bond acceptors 3, and the number of rotatable bonds <3. Recently, Pfizer’s “rule of 3/75” has been described, which states that compounds with a calculated partition coefficient (Clog P) of <3 and topological polar surface area (TPSA) >75 have the best chances of being well tolerated from a safety perspective in vivo (Hughes et al., 2008).
There are various new drugs whose development was heavily influenced by computational methods and screening strategies (Durrant & McCammon, 2011). One such important example is the HIV protease inhibitor. Most drugs are ligand–protein complexes, where the ligand enhances the function of the protein, which in turn helps it to fight against the disease. The other alternative is when the ligand helps in downregulating the expression of a particular protein it binds to. Both the scenarios depend on how well and easily the ligand and protein bind to each other. Such results of ligand–protein binding can be obtained by performing molecular docking (Gulati, Cheng, & Bates, 2013). There are many sources for the structure of the protein and drugs or ligands separately (Pak & Wang, 2000). There are not much data for protein and drug complexes.
There are three major advances in the field of drug designing (Rao & Srinivas, 2011): • The first one is the conformational modeling of all small molecules,
ligands, macromolecules, and their complexes; these are molecules that are potential drug candidates. • The next is to determine their physical, chemical, and biological properties called property modeling. • The last is to optimize the chemical, physical, and biological properties or molecular design.

Docking is not the only process that is important. Much before docking, the search and retrieval of sequences or 3D structures of target proteins are more important. Some of the databases for retrieval of sequences include NCBI, GenBank, and UniProt. Drug banks have formed an integral part of today’s drug discovery and designing. A drug bank is a unique database that consolidates information on drugs. Drug banks combine the sequence, structure, and pathway information of drugs or target drug molecules with chemical, physical, biological, pharmacological, and pharmaceutical information (Wishart, 2007). Several other databases also exist with known 3D structures of potential drug–targets, ligands, diseases, and their associated pathways.
Molecular docking is an invaluable tool in the field of molecular biology, computational structural biology, computer-aided drug designing, and pharmacogenomics. Docking also plays a vital role in virtual screening of huge libraries. The subsequent results are ranked accordingly, and structural hypothesis of how the ligands inhibit/activate the target macromolecule can be deduced (Azam & Abbasi, 2013). This proves to be an invaluable part in lead optimization of drugs. Most importantly, docking provides certain information that is difficult to deduce through conventional experimental methods. The docking procedure fits two molecules together, protein and ligand in 3D space. Their binding complementarity is then evaluated, and the results are displayed with the best fit “scores.” This method is widely used in hit identification and lead optimization of drugs. Docking, simply put, tries to find the best “fit” between two molecules. It can be a protein–ligand docking or a protein–protein docking or a nucleic acid– macromolecule docking. Docking aims at finding out if two molecules can interact. If they do interact, docking attempts to find out the orientation in which the interactions are at its maximum and where the binding energy is at its minimum (Gold, 2007). In a ligand–protein docking, the main goal is to predict the predominant binding pockets; most effective docking softwares perform this by searching high-dimensional spaces efficiently and thoroughly. The protein used for docking purpose should have previously solved 3D structure or a constructed structure by homology modeling (Alonso, Bliznyuk, & Gready, 2006). The two main aspects considered for molecular docking include accurate structural modeling and rendition of active binding site(s). Basically, docking consists of four main steps: (a) preparation of ligand and the receptor, (b) identification of active sites, (c) generation of putative complexes, and (d) evaluation of the complexes by scoring.

384

C. George Priya Doss et al.

The initial step in docking is to identify or define the binding sites by using experimental information derived from the mutagenesis or crosslinking studies or from homologous structures whose binding site is already known. Any molecule, whether a protein or a ligand, may undergo slight structural or conformational changes after binding with another molecule. This makes binding site analysis slightly difficult. Structure-based algorithms are used for binding site analysis (Lahti et al., 2012) (Ghersi & Sanchez, 2011). For the prediction of binding sites, numerous softwares are available, which are categorized into structural similarity approach, geometric approach, and energy-based approach and docking. In the next step of docking, the ligand pose has to be predicted in defined pocket. Several various molecular docking algorithms (Table 10.1) are now available that can fit or “dock” small molecules like ligands into pockets of macromolecules like proteins or sometimes DNA, with different scoring and search algorithms (Abagyan, Totrov, & Kuznetsov, 1994; B-Rao, Subramanian, & Sharma, 2009; Claussen, Buning, Rarey, & Lengauer, 2001; Ewing, Makino, Skillman, & Kuntz, 2001; Friesner et al., 2004; Goodsell, Morris, & Olson, 1996; Jones, Willett, Glen, Leach, & Taylor, 1997; McGann, Almond, Nicholls, Grant, & Brown, 2003; Morris et al., 1998; Rarey, Kramer, Lengauer, & Klebe, 1996), which can predict in an accurate and fast manner. These algorithms determine all possible optimal conformations for a given complex (protein–protein and protein–ligand) in an environment, where each conformation is linked with a final score. In addition, each algorithm calculates the energy of all the resulting conformations of each individual interaction (Sushma & Suresh, 2012). Most docking softwares use scoring techniques that correctly rank the docking conformations (McConkey et al., 2002). Scoring is an important component of docking. The work is futile if there are many conformations but no ranking system. When docking is performed, it is very important to have the right conformation of the docked molecule and also to have each individual conformation to be correctly ranked. This helps to identify the most probable biological conformations (Kollman, 1993). The scoring functions should be able to differentiate between different orientations of the same receptor and ligand. The scoring functions are mathematical functions that assign a value based on the strength of the interaction between the two docked molecules. Each docked conformation is scored for best fit (Zsoldos, Reid, Simon, Sadjad, & Johnson, 2007). This scoring process is repeated the number of times defined by the user or according to the maximum iterations supported by the program. Scoring functions predict factors like van der

Waals force, binding energy, the number of hydrogen bonds formed between the docked receptor and ligand, and other types of intermolecular interactions in the final docked molecule. Scoring only decides the best conformations for further research or for the purpose of creating a new drug (Alonso et al., 2006). Currently, scoring functions are utilized by docking softwares in one of two ways. In the first approach, the docked molecule, for example, the ligand–protein conformations, is ranked completely by the scoring functions (Huang, Grinter, & Zou, 2010). The search algorithms then modify this arrangement a little. These rearranged conformations are again ranked by the scoring functions. The second approach uses a two-stage scoring function. First, the reduced function is used to direct the search, and then more a vigorous function is used to rank the resulting structures. There are drawbacks with this directed approach. These directed methods make assumptions about the energy hyper surface, often omitting computationally expensive terms such as electrostatics, and considering only a few types of interactions such as hydrogen bonds. Such algorithms are, therefore, directed to areas of importance as determined by the reduced scoring

function (Taylor, Jewsbury, & Essex, 2002). There are many algorithms used for docking, which include search algorithm, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, genetic algorithms, fragment-based methods, point complementary methods, distance geometry methods, and systemic searches. It is important to note that many docking technologies incorporate multiple or blended approaches into their techniques. In rigid-body docking, ligand and target protein are rigid, whereas in flexible docking, the flexibility of the ligand and/or the target protein (receptor) is considered. Rigid-body docking is fast but does not consider induced fit and is cheaper in comparison to flexible docking. Major types of scoring functions are listed in the succeeding text.

7.1. Force-field scoring functions
The force-field scoring function decides the binding energy by calculating the sum on nonbonding interactions such as van der Waals, electrostatics, bond stretching/bending/torsional forces, and entropy contributions (Taylor et al., 2002). The electrostatic force is calculated by Coulombic formulation; electrostatic potential energy is represented as a pair-wise summation of Coulombic interactions (Kitchen, Decornez, Furr, & Bajorath, 2004), and van der Waals terms are described by a Lennard-Jones potential function. Changing the potential increases or decreases the acceptance threshold of the score between the protein and the ligand. Changing the potential also determines the proximity of the ligand to the protein (Meng, Zhang, Mezei, & Cui, 2011).

7.2. Empirical free-energy scoring functions
In an empirical-based scoring function, the elements such as hydrogen bond, ionic interaction, the hydrophobic effect, and binding entropy are taken individually. These components are then individually multiplied by a coefficient to give an individual score. All the individual scores are then summed up to get a final score (Campbell, Gold, Jackson, & Westhead, 2003).

7.3. Knowledge-based scoring functions
Knowledge-based scoring functions use statistical analysis of the ligand– protein interactions. The function is based on the theory that if there is a high interaction between a particular protein and a ligand, then the probability of combining them together or occurring together is very high (Meng et al., 2011).

7.4. Consensus-based scoring functions
Scoring functions are prone to errors. The consensus scoring function is more recent trend. This scoring function combines the scores of all the scoring programs and gives one final score in order to minimize the errors and to find the perfect ligand for a given target macromolecule (Meng et al., 2011). There is a potential limitation to this method; sometimes instead of the error being minimized, there can be amplification in the calculation errors, which can void the balance of this scoring function aims at (Kitchen et al., 2004).

8. TYPES OF DOCKING
Molecular docking is also referred to as small molecular docking. Molecular docking is a study of how two or more molecular structures, for instance, drug and catalyst or macromolecule receptor, match along to be a perfect fit (Gane & Dean, 2000). Binding orientation of small-molecule drug candidates to their macromolecular targets predicts the affinity and activity of a given small molecule (Hakes, Lovell, Oliver, & Robertson, 2007).
Protein–protein docking is a simple procedure, which involves docking of two protein molecules without any need of experimental measurement. Flexible and rigid docking is followed in this type of docking (Ehrlich & Wadey, 2003). Shape complementarity is the most essential ingredient of the scoring functions for protein–protein docking (Chen & Weng, 2003). The steady rise in the number of protein structures elucidated has boosted the number of protein–protein docking studies, and intensive research is being carried out in the field. Many proteins that remain rigid after forming a complex can also be docked (Hakes et al., 2007).
Protein–ligand docking is the most commonly used docking technique. It predicts the position of a ligand when it is bound to its receptor molecule, in this case, a protein. The ligand might act as an inhibitor or a promoter. Large libraries of ligands are scanned to choose potential drug candidates (Smith, Engdahl, Dunbar, & Carlson, 2012).
AutoDock is a molecular docking suite consisting of automated docking tools. AutoDock consists of two main programs: AutoDock and AutoGrid. AutoDock docks the two molecules according to the grid, which is precalculated and set by AutoGrid. AutoDock is considered one of the best programs when it comes to docking and virtual screening (Park, Lee, & Lee, 2006). This section will give a brief overview of the steps followed in AutoDock 4.2 (Fig. 10.2). Various possible problems must be resolved

before a protein can be used for AutoDock. This includes missing atoms, chain breaks, and alternate locations. Potential energy grids are used by different docking programs. These grids represent the energy calculations, and in their most basic form, the grid stashes two types of potentials: the electrostatic and the van der Waals force. The grid was formulated so that the information about the receptor’s energy contributions could be stored on grid points. This allowed the necessity of it being read only during ligand scoring. More options can be explored in AutoDock, and the options may vary depending on the complexes that are being docked and also the complexity of the problem in hand.
8.1. Advantages of docking
• The application of docking in a targeted drug-delivery system is a huge benefit. One can study the size, shape, charge distribution, polarity, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions of both ligand (drug) and receptor (target site).
• Molecular docking helps in the identification of target sites of the ligand and the receptor molecule.

• Docking also helps in understanding of different enzymes and their mechanism of action.
• The “scoring” feature in docking helps in selecting the best fit or the best drug from an array of options.
• Not everything can be proved experimentally as traditional experimental methods for drug discovery take a long time. Molecular docking helps in moving the process of computer-aided drug designing faster and also provides every conformation possible based on the receptor and ligand molecule.
• Docking has a huge advantage when it comes to the study of protein interactions.
• There are millions of compounds, ligands, drugs, and receptors, the 3D structure of which has been crystallized. Virtual screening of these compounds can be made.
8.2. Limitations of docking
• In protein–small-molecule docking, there can be problems in the receptor structure. A reliable resolution value for small-molecule docking is below 1.2 A˚ (Gohlke & Klebe, 2002), while most crystallographic structures have a resolution between 1.5 and 2.5 A˚ . Increasing the use of homology models in docking should be looked at with care as they have even poorer resolution (Mihasan, 2010). Most applications accept and yield good results for structures below 2.2 A˚ . All the same, care should be taken while picking a structure.
• The scoring functions used in docking, almost all of them, do not take into account the role played by covalently bound inhibitors or ions (Mihasan, 2012).
• The methodology and research in protein–protein docking have to be greatly increased as the success in this field is greatly hampered by many false positives and false negatives (Moreira, Fernandes, & Ramos, 2010).

9. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS
In the late 1950s and the early 1960s, Alder, Wainwright, and Rahman first developed molecular dynamics (MD) to understand the atomic movement of liquids (Maginn & Elliott, 2010). With the advancement of computer science, MD has consequently become a precious and powerful tool in many domains. Since the 1970s, MD is widely applied to study the structure and dynamics of the complexity of chemical components of life, especially

394

proteins or nucleic acids. Computer-aided drug design has come into more focus due to the development of computer science. Improvements in computer science and algorithm have played a vital role in the development of next-generation tools in computer-aided drug design. Currently, MD is used for simulations of biomolecular systems comprising many thousands of atoms within a very short span of time such as nanoseconds (Plimpton, 1995). Therefore, this method is used to solve a number of biological problems including drug discovery and development (Yang, 2010). However, in this process, more computational resources are involved. Conventional methods for the experimental determination of protein structures have relied on X-ray crystallographic and NMR techniques that have been considered to decide the structure of a protein with high precision. However, dynamic properties of molecules, especially proteins and DNA, are connected with backbone and side-chain moieties. MD enables us to understand the crucial determinants of many aspects of protein actions especially stability, folding, and function (Benkovic & Hammes-Schiffer, 2003; Eisenmesser, Bosco, Akke, & Kern, 2002; Frauenfelder, Sligar, & Wolynes, 1991; Karplus & McCammon, 2002; Rasmussen, Stock, Ringe, & Petsko, 1992; Wong & McCammon, 2003). Such dynamic processes can be understood by a variety of different techniques, particularly detecting NMR through relaxation phenomena (Kay, 1998). During drug-discovery process, crystallographic studies and NMR techniques are very important in understanding the role of protein–ligand binding as well as protein dynamics. It also helps in understanding the flexibility and motion of the proteins in the ligand-binding assay, where emerging computational methods have made the process simpler. During the prediction of protein motions, the calculations of the quantum-mechanical motion are needed, but it is difficult to explain the chemical reactions and motions in large molecular systems. MD helps to describe the chemical reactions and motion of proteins (Carloni, Rothlisberger, & Parrinello, 2002). This method helps to understand the interactions of protein and ligand or protein–drug interactions, which have multifaceted use in drug discovery and development (Utesch, Daminelli, & Mroginski, 2011).
According to quantum mechanics, physical quantities are represented by averages over microscopic conformations of the system, which are distributed in harmony with a particular statistical assembly (Weaire & Aste, 2010). Newtonian dynamics involves the conservation of energy and molecular dynamic trajectories, which can present a number of arrangements distributed according to the microcanonical ensemble. This is why physical

quantity can be calculated through MD with the help of the arithmetic average over instantaneous values of that quantity obtained from the trajectories (Tuckerman, Yarne, Samuelson, Hughes, & Martyna, 2000). In the limit of infinite, simulation time of the true value of the measured thermodynamical properties. In vitro, the quality of sampling and accuracy of the interatomic potentials used in simulations are always limited. In fact, the quality of sampling may not be proper, especially for processes of the timescale larger than typical molecular dynamic simulations, and caution should be exerted when drawing conclusions from such computer experiments (Phillips et al., 2005). MD simulations illustrate the physical movement of atoms and molecules as they interact over time. This is accomplished by the potential energy function, also so-called force fields, used in most of the standard molecular simulation programs for biological systems. It takes the form of the summation of different additive terms that correspond to bond distance stretching (Ebonds), bond-angle bending (Eangles), bond dihedral or torsion angle (Edihedrals), van der Waals potential (Evdw), and electrostatic potential (Eelect). The first three terms are considered to be the intramolecular bonding interactions, and each term involves a multitude of atoms connected by chemical bonds. The other two terms represent the nonbonded interactions between atoms. The most common force fields are OPLS-AA ( Jorgensen, Maxwell, & Tirado-Rives, 1996), CHARMM (MacKerell et al., 1998), GROMOS (Christen et al., 2005), and AMBER (Wang, Fang, et al., 2004; Wang, Wolf, et al., 2004), which can perform energy calculations, energy minimization, and dynamic calculations. These tools are regularly used in biomolecular simulation and principally vary as per their parameters. However, these tools usually give similar results. It is very interesting that the forces acting on every one of the system atoms are calculated; the site of these atoms is stimulated according to Newton’s laws of motion, and therefore, Newtonian dynamics is applicable. The simulation time is then higher, often by only 1 or 2 quadrillionths of a second, and in this way, the procedure is replicated millions of times on average. Since several calculations are necessary, MD simulations are executed on computer clusters or supercomputer systems, which run hundreds of parallel processors at a time to calculate the process (Herschbach, 1987). Some well-accepted simulation software packages are AMBER (Case et al., 2005), CHARMM (MacKerell et al., 1998), and NAMD (Kale´ et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2005), which apply their default force fields. In the current era, pharmacogenomics is a prominent field, and drug discovery is moving in this direction. There are many studies where MD is applied in studying the conformational space accessible to proteins

and protein–ligand interactions and refined experimental or modeled protein structures (Schlick, Collepardo-Guevara, Halvorsen, Jung, & Xiao, 2011). Modeled protein structures (Fan et al., 2009) reveal transient binding sites (Ivetac & McCammon, 2010), examine the stability and strength of docked protein–ligand conformations (B-Rao et al., 2009), aid drug discovery (Salsbury, 2010), and explore altered drug binding profiles of protein variants (Shan et al., 2011). In addition to this, MD simulations were carried out on both the native and mutant proteins to show its flexibility and effects on the protein (George Priya Doss, Nagasundaram, Chakraborty, Chen, & Zhu, 2013; George Priya Doss, Rajith, & Chakraborty, 2013; George Priya Doss, Rajith, Rajasekaran, et al., 2013; John et al., 2013; Miteva, Brugge, Rosing, Nicolaes, & Villoutreix, 2004; Steen, Miteva, Villoutreix, Yamazaki, & Dahlback, 2003; Witham, Takano, Schwartz, & Alexov, 2011; Zhang, Teng, Wang, Schwartz, & Alexov, 2010), stability on protein–protein interactions (George Priya Doss & Nagasundaram, 2013), and protein–ligand (George Priya Doss, Rajith, Chakraborty, Balaji, et al., 2013; Nagasundaram & George Priya Doss, 2013) and protein– DNA interactions (George Priya Doss & Nagasundaram, 2012). There are studies showing agreement between computational and experimental measurements of macromolecular dynamics (Bruschweiler & Showalter, 2007; LaConte, Voelz, Nelson, & Thomas, 2002; Markwick et al., 2010; Peter et al., 2003). Combining this information, MD analysis has the potential to be a vital resource in elucidating the molecular effects of mutations and variable drug responses in the context of target protein structures with genetic variants. Here, molecular dynamics has an advantage over experimental methods. Along with the molecular dynamic power, advances in computer technology and algorithm design will definitely act as a driving force in computer-aided drug design in the development of novel pharmacological drugs.

10. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The current world is fast paced; the number of diseases crippling the human race is on the rise. This has caused a never before seen urgency for results for drugs to combat the various diseases that plague the human race. In such a demanding era, science has to rely on bioinformatics, an emerging field that has helped to cut down on the huge amount of time and resources that are otherwise wasted. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the most common single amino acid substitutions found in the human genome.

There exist quite a few traditional methods of SNP analysis. Few examples of such experimental methods include DNA sequencing, capillary electrophoresis, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and restriction fragment length polymorphism. These traditional methods have many limitations. A few of these methods require a large sample of DNA, require expensive equipments, and also face difficulty in handling large sequences and are also not practically easy in the process of complicated drug designing. The completion of the Human Genome Project has changed the each core of bioinformatics. With a plethora of data available at the click of a mouse, and very little time in obtaining results, it is impossible to rely only on traditional experimental methods. Drug designing in the late twentieth century has been on the rise. This called for the integration of computational methods as they help in relaying whether the compound or a ligand of which is being screened as a potential drug can be an asset or liability to a particular research. Quality of information can also be improved with the use of computational methods. Computers can integrate results from both in vivo and in vitro studies from many different labs. This information database can be used by scientists and researchers from all over the world to come up with better and faster results, and newer technologies. Computational methods now allow scientists to cut down on animal testing, as the data provided are accurate, and further testing can be done with computer modeling. This saves wastage of chemicals and also reduces animal suffering.
Personalized medicine is another upcoming field; the scientific community is looking at now. It is common knowledge that a drug that is effective for one person may not be as effective or may even be harmful to another individual. All this is caused by the tiniest changes in our genomes, which make us different from one another (SNPs). Identifying significant SAPs that produce clinically relevant phenotype is important to provide personalized diagnosis and treatment. Personalized medicine would require sequencing each person’s genome, analyzing the SNPs, and then formulating which drug would be best suited for a particular individual. Even though computational methods give a faster access to the solution, they are still only predictions. These methods can only predict which SAPs are deleterious and particular disease phenotypes. These methods cannot provide insight how the disruption happens on a molecular scale. Hence, bridging this gap between computational and clinical methods proves to be a challenging task for personalized and precision medicine. There are also limitations to abovementioned computational methods. All the data produced might not be useful, if the results or observations made during experiments vary.

Most of the methods used in in silico still have gaping holes that are yet to be filled. More research is required to improve the quality of results derived from such computational research. Existing SAP prediction methods, homology modeling methods, docking, and molecular dynamics softwares have different algorithms and varying protocols. The scoring algorithms of in silico tools have to be looked into, as even now, researchers have to rely on multiple scoring algorithms and manually cross-check to see if the results hold true. Therefore, only computational methods cannot be used to validate a drug. Most of the computational prediction methods available online were benchmarked by the curators with their known datasets and were shown to perform well. There are mounting studies that compare the prediction scores from a set of methods and the results bring to light that no single method can be rated as the best predictor. The results obtained from these indicate that a combination of different methods with sequence and structure information may provide a wider coverage and accurate prediction in the study of SAPs to be either deleterious or neutral. Basically, computational methods used different algorithms to predict the impact of deleterious variants, and therefore, the outcome may differ for each tool. However, the positive predictions overlap in all the computational disease prediction methods, which show that they have a high possibility to behave in a similar fashion. The variation in their prediction scores might be due to the difference in features utilized by the methods or the trained datasets.
Computational research has to be complemented with traditional experimental methods. Computational methods help in narrowing down the possible choices of drugs or target molecules, and the experimental biologist can take the given output and check how a drug or any compound will work in a biological system. It has been more than a decade, since the completion of the Human Genome Project. This has helped us to gain insight into the human genome. For instance, the recent ENCODE project has helped to bring before us the biochemical functions of almost 80% of the human genome. In spite of this, a revolution in the medical field is yet to be seen. Cost and time reduction methods can sequence the human genome points to a near future where DNA sequencing would be routinely used in medical practices. A human genome sequence generates a large amount of data, and additional data will be generated in the case of sequencing carried out for personalized medicines. There is a need for next-generation computers and faster networks that can easily handle and process many terabytes of data. When clinical practices will be amalgamated with computational power in the future, the systems should be able to handle the influx of a large amount

of data from all the patients. The computers must also be able to take on each task based on their nature of urgency. Moreover, prioritizing the disease genes can also be incorporated. All these issues need to be dealt with so that the populace receives the best medical attention. The promise of personalized medicine and precision medicine will be made possible by the computational methods discussed in this chapter and will be a useful resource for researchers looking to widen their research scope.
