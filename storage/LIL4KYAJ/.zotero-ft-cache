ABSTRACT: Despite the numerous computational eﬀorts on estimating acid dissociation constant (pKa’s), an accurate estimation of pKa’s of bio-organic molecules in the aqueous medium is still a challenge. The major diﬃculty lies in the accurate description of the aqueous environment and the cost and accuracy of quantum mechanical (QM) methods. Herein, we report a well-deﬁned quantum chemical protocol for accurately calculating pKa’s of a wide range of bio-organic molecules in aqueous media. The performance of our method has been assessed using test sets containing molecules with a range of sizes and a variety of functional groups, including alcohols, phenols, amines, and carboxylic acids, and obtained an impressive mean absolute accuracy of 0.5 pKa units. For the smaller molecules, we use a high-level QM method (CBS-QB3) and a calibrated explicit−implicit solvation model that yields accurate pKa values for a range of functional groups. For the larger molecules, we combine this approach with an eﬃcient errorcancellation scheme that eliminates the systematic errors in diﬀerent density functional methods to yield accurate pKa values for simple to complex molecular systems. Our protocol is eﬃcient, applicable to large molecules, covers all the common functional groups present in bio-organic molecules, and should ﬁnd widespread applications in diverse research areas including drug−protein binding, catalysis, and chemical synthesis.

1. INTRODUCTION

Knowledge of the acid dissociation constant (pKa value) of a molecule is essential to understand its stability as well as

reactivity. In chemical processes such as drug−protein binding,

catalysis, and chemical synthesis, the pKa can determine the fate of a chemical reaction by altering the overall reaction mechanism.1−5 Performing accurate experimental pKa measurements in aqueous solutions is not always feasible due to the

problems associated with synthetic diﬃculties, isolation and

puriﬁcation, interference from other solutes and the solvent environment, etc.6 Additionally, it may be advantageous to

screen the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds

for potential applications without having to synthesize the

actual molecules. In this regard, quantum mechanical (QM)

calculations can be useful to obtain the desired property with suﬃciently high accuracy.7

various general,

solute−solvent interactions are described by using continuum solvation models to make the QM calculations tractable.6,14−17

The accuracy of the calculated pKa value primarily depends on the quality of the QM method used and the solvation model employed to describe the solute−solvent interaction.10 It has

been shown that high-quality pKa values can be obtained if a correct level of theory along with an appropriate solvation

model is selected for the particular functional group of interest.18−24 However, it becomes a real challenge, even for

the experts, to select a method to use from a plethora of available QM methods. Moreover, the insuﬃcient accuracy of empirically ﬁtted implicit solvation models further adds to the source of errors in the pKa calculations.6,11,12 Some of these issues have been addressed, to a limited extent, by several research groups through the extensive screening of QM methods for a particular functional group,20,23 correcting systematic errors via a linear regression ﬁt approach,25−28 using reference acids,12,29−32 reparameterizing the implicit solvent parameters,33−36 or using explicit−implicit solvation.27,37−44 Since there are a large number of small molecules with experimentally measured pKa values, and the errors in QMcalculated deprotonation free energies are somewhat systematic for a speciﬁc functional group, the free energy changes can be calculated with a cheaper QM method and ﬁtted separately for diﬀerent functional groups to obtain a reasonable overall accuracy. A similar approach has been used in Jaguar pKa,45 a popular pKa prediction software, that uses experimental pKa values of 1134 small molecules to obtain linear ﬁt equations for approximately 100 speciﬁc functional groups and uses that information to estimate the pKa of a new molecule. However, there is no single QM method-based computational protocol that works uniformly for most of the commonly studied bioorganic molecules without such corrections.

Scheme 1. Illustrative Example Showing the Derivation of ΔCBH-1 and ΔCBH-2 Reaction Schemes for a Deprotonation Reaction

In this study, we present a novel and computationally eﬃcient protocol for calculating accurate pKa values of small (and simple) to larger (more complex) bio-organic molecules containing a wide variety of functional groups including alcohols, amines, thiols, and carboxylic acids. In particular, we address some of the major questions in the current literature regarding pKa calculations:
(1) Is it possible to have a single theoretical protocol that works accurately for a wide range of functional groups?
(2) Can we obtain accurate pKa values for a functional group of interest using a range of QM methods, particularly with a variety of density functionals?
(3) If the protocol is accurate, is it computationally aﬀordable?
The protocol presented here corrects for the systematic errors in calculated pKa values associated with various DFT (or WFT) methods and does not require any input from experimental data. The protocol is based on a modiﬁed version of our connectivity-based hierarchy (CBH)46,47 approach, where the systematic error in the calculated pKa (for a given molecule with a speciﬁed QM scheme) is identiﬁed as the intrinsic error in the free energy change of an elementary reaction that represents the fundamental chemical change during deprotonation (see refs 46 and 47 for details about the CBH scheme). This enables accurate pKa calculations on a large number of relatively complex molecules with a mean absolute deviation of 0.5 pKa units from the experiment.
Our proposed scheme is accomplished in two major steps. We ﬁrst develop a standard and accurate pKa calculation protocol for small molecules using a single reliable QM method (CBS-QB3) in conjunction with an explicit−implicit (SMD) solvation model that is calibrated and applicable for small-to-medium-sized molecules containing various common

functional groups. The explicit−implicit solvation approach adopted here has been shown to represent the solute−solvent interactions much more accurately compared to the implicitonly solvation approach.48 We then formulate a well-deﬁned CBH-based systematic error-correction scheme that enables accurate pKa’s of signiﬁcantly larger bio-organic molecules in the aqueous medium.
The following sequence represents our overall proposed scheme.
(1) Calculate the pKa of the parent deprotonation reaction (PR) using a selected low-level (DFT or WFT) method.

pKalow_qm,implicit(PR)

=

ΔGd*eprot 2.303RT

(1)

where ΔGd*eprot is the free energy change for a deprotonation reaction in the aqueous medium calculated at the low-level
QM (DFT or WFT) method, R is the gas constant, and T is
the temperature (see Section 2 for details). Note that these
calculations only involve implicit solvation models and are computationally highly eﬃcient.

(2) Compare the calculated pKa with the experimentally measured pKa for the same reaction to obtain the raw error for the given method. This error is denoted as “ΔpKa-0”.

ΔpKa‐1 = pKalow_qm,implicit(PR) − pKaexperiment(PR)

(2)

(3) To correct the error associated with the given low-level method, construct the CBH reaction scheme at the desired CBH-n rung (here, only n = 1 and 2 are considered) to ﬁnd out the elementary reaction involved in deprotonation (Scheme 1 and Scheme S1). CBH rungs are constructed for both the protonated and deprotonated species based on the local bonding

structure and connectivity of the molecule. Each increasing CBH rung preserves a larger local environment in the CBH fragments and yields an increasing level of sophistication. The simplest rung is the isogyric scheme (i.e., CBH-0; not considered in this study) where each heavy (nonhydrogen) atom is extracted in its saturated valance state (e.g., CH4, NH3, and H2O). The next rung, CBH-1, is the same as the popular Pople’s isodesmic scheme.49 In this rung, fragments are constructed by extracting all the heavy atom−heavy atom bonds in the molecule and saturated to satisfy their valence states (e.g., CH3−OH, CH2CH2, and CH3− SH). In the CBH-2 scheme, the immediate connectivity of each heavy atom is included to preserve the local bonding environment (Scheme 1 and Scheme S1). Similarly, higher rungs of CBH such as CBH-3 and CBH-4 can be constructed, preserving successively larger local bonded environments.
(4) The net reactions derived from the desired CBH-n rung are denoted as ΔCBH-n (e.g., ΔCBH-1 for rung 1, and ΔCBH-2 for rung 2) (Scheme 1 and Scheme S1). Since
C

the structural change during deprotonation is small, a signiﬁcant part of the reactant and product molecules remains identical and gets canceled (vide infra). Thus, the sizes of the molecules involved in these net reactions are quite small.
(5) Compute the pKa of the elementary deprotonation reaction obtained from the CBH-n scheme with both the current DFT (or WFT) method and an accurate reference method (CBS-QB3 in this work) to obtain the systematic error correction (vide infra). All the CBH fragments (both protonated and deprotonated species) involved in the net CBH-n reaction are geometryoptimized independently at the respective level of theory. Note that the reference CBS-QB3 calculations are done with an explicit−implicit solvation model but are computationally feasible due to the small sizes of the molecules involved in the elementary reactions. The diﬀerence in the calculated pKa values between the current low-level (DFT or WFT) method and the reference method for the elementary reaction is the CBH-n correction at the given CBH rung, which is then

subtracted from the raw low-level pKa value (pKalow_qm, implicit(PR)) to obtain the CBH-corrected pKa value for the parent reaction. A fully worked example of CBH scheme including the raw calculated as well as corrected pKa values is given in the Supporting Information. The overall pKa and corrections at various rungs are calculated as follows:
For the CBH-1 scheme:

ΔCBH‐1 correction = pK alow_qm,implicit(ΔCBH‐1) − pKaCBS−QB3,explicit−implicit

(ΔCBH‐1)

(3)

Calculated pKa of the parent reaction with CBH-1 correction:

pKa‐1 = pKalow_qm,implicit(PR) − ΔCBH‐1 correction (4)

Error in the calculated pKa of parent reaction with CBH-1 correction:

ΔpKa‐1 = pKa‐1 − pKaexperiment(PR)

(5)

Similarly, for the CBH-2 scheme:

ΔCBH‐2 correction

= pK alow_qm,implicit(ΔCBH‐2)

− pKaCBS−QB3,explicit−implicit(ΔCBH‐2)

(6)

Calculated pKa of the parent reaction with CBH-2 correction:

pKa‐2 = pKalow_qm,implicit(PR) − ΔCBH‐2 correction (7)

Error in calculated pKa of the parent reaction with CBH-2 correction:

ΔpKa‐2 = pKa‐2 − pKaexperiment(PR)

(8)

An alternative possibility that we have explored is to use the experimental pKa as a reference in the elementary CBH reaction if it is available for all of the species involved in the net pKa reaction, but we show (vide infra) that our protocol works even more eﬀectively without using any experimental data for error correction.
For most of the molecules considered in this study, the fragments involved in each rung of the CBH scheme can be uniquely identiﬁed. However, for molecules containing functional groups that are conjugated with the aromatic rings such as phenols, anilines, benzoic acids, etc., we propose a modiﬁed version of the conventional CBH scheme for a more eﬀective treatment of the aromatic environment (Scheme S1). If the group undergoing deprotonation is directly bonded to an aromatic ring, the full aromatic ring is considered as a single group. This helps to preserve the electron delocalization within a fragment. On the other hand, rings that are far from the deprotonation site are not aﬀected since their chemical environment is identical in the protonated and deprotonated states and get canceled in the net CBH reaction.

2. METHODS
2.1. Test Sets. To develop a reliable protocol and demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we constructed three test sets of molecules containing a wide range of functional groups such as amine, alcohol, phenol, thiol,

carboxylic acid, etc. (see Scheme 2 and Tables S1−S11),
which have the experimentally measured pKa values in the range of −1 to 20. The ﬁrst set (Set-I) was assembled to establish a standard protocol for calculating accurate pKa’s using a reliable computational model (CBS-QB3) in conjunction with an explicit−implicit model for solvation (SMD50 solvation model for implicit solvation). It comprises a total of 224 small bio-organic molecules containing 2−12
heavy atoms, with 22 nitrogen-containing aromatic hetero-
cycles (e.g., imidazole, pyridine, and pyridazine), 15 alcohols,
14 thiols, 26 carboxylic acids, 10 primary amines, 8 secondary
amines, 5 tertiary amines, 39 phenols, 13 thiophenols, 34 anilines, 10 carbon acids (acidity of α-CH of aldehydes,
ketones, and amides), and 28 benzoic acid molecules (Tables S1−S11). In the second test set (Set-II), a total of 72
molecules were selected to benchmark the application of the CBH scheme for calculating pKa’s of larger molecules (Table S11). Molecules in this set were selected such that most of the
fragments involved in the elementary reactions of the CBH-2 scheme have experimentally measured pKa’s. This helps to calibrate the performance of error-correction schemes based
on experiments versus those obtained without recourse to
experiments. The third dataset (Set-III) includes a total of 28 drug molecules with experimentally measured pKa’s for the parent molecule but not for all the CBH fragments (Scheme 2)
and serves as a target dataset to assess the performance of the
protocol developed in this study. Some of the molecules in this
set have multiple ionizable functional groups. For those
molecules, separate microscopic pKa values were calculated for each of the ionizable groups (see Figures S5−S11), and the
value that is closest to the experiment was used for the
comparison. While our assignments are unambiguous, a better
agreement between the calculated and experimental pKa values could potentially be achieved using the contributions from
multiple ionization states. 2.2. pKa Calculation. For a deprotonation reaction, BH⇌
B− + H+, the acid dissociation constant (pKa) is calculated as

pKa

=

ΔGa*q 2.303RT

(9)

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (298.15 K), and ΔGa*q is the aqueous phase free energy change for the deprotonation reaction. ΔGa*q is calculated as

ΔGa*q = GB*−,aq + GH*+,aq − GB*H,aq

(10)

where GB*−,aq, GH*+,aq, and of deprotonated species

GB*H,aq are, respectively, the free energy (B), free energy of proton (H+), and

the free energy of acid (BH) in aqueous medium. GB*−,aq and GB*H,aq are calculated directly in aqueous medium using the SMD implicit solvation and the QM methods discussed below.

No thermodynamic cycle was used to calculate the free

energies in solution since it has been recommended in many studies.16,20,40,42,51 The aqueous phase free energy of proton

(GH*+,aq) is calculated as

GH*+,aq = GHo +,gas + ΔGH*+,solv + ΔG1atm→1M

2.3. Computational Details. The pKa calculations were performed using seven popular density functional methods [four hybrid methods (B3LYP,56−58 ωB97X,59 M06-2X, and CAM-B3LYP) and three of their empirical dispersioncorrected variants (B3LYP-D3BJ, ωB97X-D, and CAMB3LYP-D3BJ)60,61] with the 6-311++G(d,p)62−66 basis set, as well as a reliable compound model chemistry, CBS-QB3.67 Molecular geometry optimization was carried out in the aqueous medium with the SMD50 implicit solvation model. For the CBS-QB3 method, geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were performed using the B3LYP/6311++G(d,p) level, followed by a single-point energy calculation at the CBS-QB3 level. Harmonic frequencies were examined to conﬁrm that the calculated structures are local minima on the potential energy surface. Entropies and thermal corrections were calculated under the standard protocol from statistical thermodynamics of an ideal gas with rigid rotor/harmonic oscillator approximation at 298.15 K. Vibrational frequencies were scaled by 0.99 to match with the CBS-QB3 method for the calculation of zero-point energies, entropies, and thermal corrections. The eﬀect of low-frequency vibration in calculated pKa was also investigated using the quasi-harmonic oscillator approximation (QHA)68 (see frequency scaling section of the Supporting Information for details). Comparing the result obtained for the set of 224 molecules (Figures S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information), it is observed that the cutoﬀ value of 100 cm−1 improved the performance on average by 0.3 pKa units compared to QHAcorrected frequencies. Therefore, for the ﬁnal pKa calculations, the vibrational modes with lower frequencies were scaled to 100 cm−1 before computing their contribution to the Gibbs free energy. For the molecules with multiple rotatable bonds, a conformational search was performed in both the protonated and deprotonated forms using the MMFF94 force ﬁeld69 with a 7.0 kcal/mol energy window using the GMMX conformation search module implemented in GaussView.70 The low-energy conformers were further reﬁned by optimizing the structures at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) in aqueous solution including SMD implicit solvation (without explicit solvent molecules) to obtain the lowest-energy conformer. Only the lowest-energy conformers in the protonated and deprotonated forms were used in the pKa calculations. The eﬀect of including higherenergy conformers in the calculated pKa was not explored; however, we do realize that including contribution from some of the higher energy conformers can be important in some cases. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 program suite.71

Therefore, we have benchmarked a standard protocol for

calculating accurate pKa with SMD implicit solvation in conjunction with a few explicit solvent molecules using a

single reliable QM method. More speciﬁcally, free energy

calculations were performed at the CBS-QB3 level of theory

with the SMD implicit solvation model (see Section 2 for

computational details).

To explore the eﬀect of explicit water molecules on the

calculated pKa’s and to obtain the optimum number of explicit water molecules required, we computed the pKa’s by including zero, one, two, and three explicit water molecules placed near

the functional group being protonated/deprotonated (e.g., −OH/−O−, −NH3+/−NH2) along with the SMD implicit solvation model (Figure 1). For the deprotonation of carbon

acids (α-H of aldehydes, ketones, and amides), explicit waters

were placed only near the carbonyl oxygen since the

deprotonated species (i.e., carbanion) is expected to be in

resonance with its more stable enolate anion. Our study is

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. pKa Calculation Using Explicit−Implicit Solvation. As outlined above, to obtain accurate pKa’s using the CBH scheme, it is necessary to have accurate pKa values for the elementary reactions. While a large number of small organic molecules have experimentally measured pKa values, it is not always possible to ﬁnd experimental pKa values for all necessary CBH fragments. Despite a signiﬁcant number of theoretical methods that have been developed and tested over three decades, surprisingly, no pKa protocol based on a single QM method works satisfactorily across the full range of common functional groups. In particular, it has been demonstrated in recent years that implicit solvent models are

limited to including the explicit water molecules in the ﬁrst solvation shell based on the assumption that the bulk solvation properties are captured with implicit solvation. Arrangement of water molecules around the various functional groups is shown in Figure 1. Both the protonated and deprotonated states were solvated with an equal number of explicit solvent molecules to maintain the same, balanced solvent environment. For the initial guess of explicit−implicit solvation, water molecules were placed along the (O/N/S)−H bonds and/or in a tetrahedral arrangement with each water, forming only one hydrogen bond with the solute as shown the Figure 1, and geometry optimization was carried out at the B3LYP/6-311+ +G(d,p) level of theory. For the explicit solvation of nitrogencontaining aromatic compounds, only one water molecule is placed per N/O/S atom in the same plane of the ring, forming only one hydrogen bond. The arrangement of explicit water molecules near the protonated and deprotonated species was kept as consistent as possible (i.e., same number of hydrogen bonds and similar conformations) to avoid any bias that may result in unsystematic contributions to the calculated pKa values. Maintaining the same explicit−implicit solvation environment on both protonated and deprotonated species also helps treat the solvent hydrogen bonding environment in a more balanced way and cancels some of the systematic errors introduced by the inclusion of explicit waters (e.g., explicit water conformations and contributions from additional lowfrequency modes from explicit waters). This approach is slightly diﬀerent from the commonly used explicit−implicit solvation approach where explicit solvents are added only to the charged species. Errors in pKa values calculated with zero to three explicit water molecules with respect to the experiment are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 in the paper and Tables S1−S11 in the Supporting Information. The results show that the required number of water molecules is slightly

diﬀerent for diﬀerent functional groups to achieve the desired
accuracy of <1 pKa unit. Among the various functional groups considered, aliphatic
amines are the only functional groups for which consistently
good performance is obtained with implicit solvation models (MAE = 0.25−0.55 pKa units). Thus, there is a very little room for improvement upon inclusion of explicit waters, and we discuss them only brieﬂy. For primary amines, best results were
obtained with two explicit water molecules (MAE = 0.33). For
secondary amines, the inclusion of one explicit water molecule
gave similarly accurate results (MAE = 0.30 pKa units), while the results got slightly worse for tertiary amines (MAE = 0.60),
possibly due to the steric repulsion from amine nitrogen
substituents. As seen below, substantially improved results are
obtained for all other functional groups with a small number of
explicit solvent molecules.
Compared to the aliphatic amines, the errors in the calculated pKa’s are substantially larger (2−10 pKa units) for all other functional groups using implicit solvation calculations.
These errors can vary depending on the type of implicit
solvation used. Inclusion of explicit water molecules was found to be necessary to evaluate the pKa’s accurately. By including one to three explicit water molecules (Figure 1) depending on
the functional groups, an impressive accuracy (overall mean
absolute error of 0.45 pKa unit and the maximum mean absolute error of 0.78 pKa unit) has been achieved for all the functional groups considered in this study (Table 1 and Tables S1−S11). Compared to the SMD-only calculated pKa’s, inclusion of explicit waters most dramatically improved the
error in the calculated pKa values of aliphatic alcohols (MAE lowered from 9.41 to 0.40), aliphatic thiols (MAE improved
from 8.42 to 0.50), phenols (MAE lowered from 4.90 to 0.46),
and thiophenols (MAE lowered from 5.57 to 0.62). Similarly, even for the more challenging case of carbon acids (α-CH of
aldehydes, ketones, and amides), a remarkable improvement in
the calculated pKa is seen with the inclusion of three explicit water molecules placed around the carbonyl oxygen that
stabilizes the conjugate base (i.e., enolate anion).
To further assess if the performance of our pKa calculation protocol is systematic, we plotted the pKa’s calculated using CBS-QB3 and SMD, with and without the explicit solvent
molecules, as a function of experimentally measured pKa values (Figure 2). When the overall results for all functional groups
calculated with SMD/CBS-QB3 and no explicit waters are
linearly correlated with the experiment, a moderate correlation (R2 = 0.85) with a signiﬁcant slope (1.669) and a large intercept (−2.458) is obtained (Figure 3a). However, a better
correlation can be obtained for some functional groups if only the pKa’s of those speciﬁc functional groups are correlated with the experimental values (Figures S3 and S4). On the other
hand, the results obtained with the CBS-QB3 and SMD
solvation with the optimum number of explicit waters listed in Table 1 are rather impressive. An excellent correlation (R2 =
0.98) is found between the calculated and available
experimental pKa values. Furthermore, both the slope (1.005) and intercept (0.00) of the linear ﬁt line improve
quite dramatically, close to their ideal values.
Overall, the pKa results calculated for various functional groups using the CBS-QB3 and SMD implicit solvation with
zero to three explicit water molecules are excellent. We note
that our study is restricted to the study of functional groups with a measured range of pKa values from −1 to 20. At suﬃciently lower (<−1) and higher (>20) pH ranges where

water itself may be in a charged state (either protonated or deprotonated), correcting implicit solvation with neutral water might not be an appropriate model, and further calibrations of computational models may be needed. For the functional groups considered in this study, no other adjustment of the solvation model is required to accurately calculate the pKa’s. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst single QM method-based computational protocol that works well for a variety of functional groups present in many of the common bio-organic molecules.
3.2. CBH Scheme for pKa Calculation. In the pKa calculation protocol discussed above, the free energies are computed at the CBS-QB3 level. This method can be readily applied to small molecules containing up to 10−20 heavy atoms within a reasonable amount of CPU time. However, it becomes prohibitively expensive for larger molecules and hence limits the direct application of the abovementioned approach. For such systems, the use of cheaper methods such as DFT or more applicable WFT methods (e.g., MP2) is commonly followed. As shown in the previous studies, the

accuracy of these methods is very system-dependent. There-
fore, no single QM method can be used to calculate the pKa values for diﬀerent functional groups. In contrast, our CBH-
based error cancellation scheme can reduce the computational
cost while maintaining a similar high accuracy for all functional groups. To demonstrate this deﬁnitively, we computed the pKa of 72 small-to-medium-sized molecules (Set-II) using the
CBH scheme. These selected molecules have the experimentally measured pKa’s for the full molecule as well as for the elementary reactions involved in the CBH rungs. A
representative net chemical reaction involved in CBH-1 and

pKa’s calculated using various rungs of the CBH-n (n = 0, 1, and 2) scheme. The pKa values calculated using most DFT functionals without any corrections are found to deviate by
more than 3 pKa units from the experimental values. While some of the DFT methods performed relatively well for a
subset of molecules, none of them worked satisfactorily for all
of the considered functional groups. The errors in the

Theoretically calculated pKa values were used as the reference for the elementary CBH fragments.

calculated pKa (ΔpKa-0) drop signiﬁcantly when the ΔCBH-1 scheme is used (ΔpKa-1 = 0.8−1.3). While the results with ΔCBH-1 are signiﬁcantly better than DFT methods alone
without any correction, some of the errors are still considerably
large (>2 pKa units) due to the inconsistent treatment of local bonding environments by the CBH-1 scheme (Table S12).
This shows that the pKa correction via the isodesmic reaction scheme (i.e., CBH-1) alone is not suﬃcient to achieve the

target accuracy of <1 pKa unit. The errors drop dramatically when the ΔCBH-2 scheme is used. The mean unsigned error is in the range of 0.40−0.45 pKa units for all the DFT functionals used. It is impressive to see that the results are systematically
improved for all of the deprotonating functional groups. The best results were obtained for B3LYP with ΔpKa-2 = 0.40 pKa units (Figures 4 and 5). Interestingly, the errors in the calculated pKa using the explicit−implicit approach (ΔCBH-

n(Thr)) for the elementary reactions are similar or better than using the experimental pKa values (ΔCBH-n(Exp)), partly due to a better cancelation of errors in the theoretically calculated values. The overall results show that an impressive accuracy in the calculated pKa values can be obtained by using ΔCBH-2 scheme without using any experiment-based corrections.
To further assess the applicability of our CBH-based pKa calculation approach in larger and chemically interesting molecules, we computed the pKa of 28 drug molecules randomly selected from a drug database (Scheme 2). This test set covers a pKa range of 2−12 pKa units, typical of the pKa values of common bio-organic systems. For this data set, only the ΔCBH-2 scheme was used since it gave the best results (MAE = 0.40−0.45 pKa units) for the DFT methods in Set-II. The calculated pKa values and the errors for Set-III molecules are shown in Figure 6 and Table S4. For the molecules with multiple ionizable groups, separate CBH-2 schemes were constructed to calculate the corresponding microscopic pKa values (Figure S5−S11). With the ΔCBH-2 scheme, calculated errors are signiﬁcantly lower compared to the uncorrected pKa’s (ΔpKa-0 = 1.8−3.5 units versus ΔpKa-2 = 0.44−0.54 units). Interestingly, the functional group R−SO2−NH2 present in two of the molecules in Set-III (molecules III.10 and III.14) was not included in any of the previous two datasets yet yielded accurate results. This demonstrates the applicability of our pKa calculation approach in molecules containing functional groups that were not explicitly calibrated in this study.
The pKa calculation protocol based on CBH scheme also works if a molecule possesses multiple ionizable groups or tautomeric forms (e.g., III.2, III.3, and III.9). For such molecules, separate CBH schemes can be constructed for each of the deprotonating functional groups to derive the separate elementary deprotonation reactions. In such cases, the explicit water molecules are placed only near the deprotonating functional group under consideration. In this way, each of the functional groups can be microsolvated locally and separately without having to include explicit solvent molecules around all of the functional groups at once. This also avoids the complication that may arise while placing explicit water molecules around all of the functional groups at the same time. For example, for the molecule III.3, which has two phenolic OH groups and one aliphatic amine group, three separate CBH reactions are constructed for each of the functional groups, and the corresponding pKa values are then obtained (see Figures S5−S11).
4. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, this study presents a standard protocol for accurately calculating pKa’s of a wide range of bio-organic molecules in the aqueous medium. By including a few (0−3) explicit solvent molecules and a SMD implicit solvation model, an impressive accuracy of MAE = 0.45 pKa units was achieved for small bio-organic molecules with experimental pKa values in the range of −1 to 20 at the CBS-QB3 level. For the functional groups benchmarked in this study, our explicit−implicit solvation protocol with the recommended number of explicit water molecules and SMD/CBS-QB3 method can be directly used without further benchmarking. For the larger molecules, where CBS-QB3-based approach is computationally unaﬀordable, we present an eﬃcient pKa calculation protocol based on the CBH error-cancelation scheme. Using the CBH-2 scheme, we showed that our protocol eliminates the systematic errors

in diﬀerent DFT methods to yield accurate pKa values (MAE of 0.40−0.54 pKa units) for simple to complex molecular systems. Our results showed that, by treating the elementary deprotonation reactions at the CBS-QB3 level with explicit− implicit solvation, the calculated pKa’s are nearly independent of the DFT method used. It is possible that, for some bioorganic molecules, CBH-2 scheme may not be suﬃcient to capture the local bonding environment in the elementary reactions. In such cases, the accuracy can be further improved by using higher rungs of the CBH schemes (e.g., ΔCBH-3). Nonetheless, we note that the current protocol covers most of the common functional groups present in organic and biomolecular systems. Our unique pKa calculation protocol should ﬁnd widespread applications in diﬀerent areas of research such as exploring reaction mechanisms, synthetic chemistry, and structure-based drug design.
