Data recording and neuron visualization Auditory neurons were recorded and stained using thick-walled glass micropipettes ﬁlled with 5% Lucifer yellow and 0.5 M LiCl (resistance 100–150 MQ). After recording, ganglia were processed conventionally and the stained neurons were identiﬁed under an ultraviolet ﬂuorescence microscope. To record ﬁctive motor activity, we placed a suction electrode on mesothoracic nerve 3A, which contains motor axons that innervate wing closer and opener muscles. A microphone (Audio-Technica AT853A) recorded sound produced by the cricket and an optoelectronic camera monitored wing movements. All data were transferred directly onto a computer through an AD board (Data Translation 2821 F8DI) with a sampling rate of 10 kHz per channel. We analysed data off-line using Neurolab30 and Microsoft Excel 2000.

Large-conductance (BK type) Ca21-dependent K1 channels are essential for modulating muscle contraction and neuronal activities such as synaptic transmission and hearing1–5. BK channels are activated by membrane depolarization and intracellular Ca21 and Mg21 (refs 6–10). The energy provided by voltage, Ca21 and Mg21 binding are additive in activating the channel, suggesting that these signals open the activation gate through independent pathways9,11. Here we report a molecular investigation of a Mg21dependent activation mechanism. Using a combined sitedirected mutagenesis and structural analysis, we demonstrate that a structurally new Mg21-binding site in the RCK/Rossman fold domain—an intracellular structural motif that immediately follows the activation gate S6 helix12–15—is responsible for Mg21dependent activation. Mutations that impair or abolish Mg21 sensitivity do not affect Ca21 sensitivity, and vice versa. These results indicate distinct structural pathways for Mg21- and Ca21dependent activation and suggest a possible mechanism for the coupling between Mg21 binding and channel opening.
The energetically separate Ca2þ- and Mg2þ-dependent activation pathways suggest that each pathway may involve distinct structural components of the channel. Previous results suggest that a lowafﬁnity, divalent cation-binding site that is responsible for Mg2þdependent activation may be located in the amino-terminal core of mouse Slo1 (mSlo1) subunits9,16 (Fig. 1a). Thus, the Mg2þ-binding site is distinct from the high-afﬁnity Ca2þ-binding site that has been proposed to reside in the carboxy terminal tail17–19 (Fig. 1a). The RCK domain is an intracellular motif of the core that immediately follows the activation gate S6 helix12–15 (Fig. 1a). It is conserved among BK channels, various prokaryotic Kþ channels and TrkA proteins (which regulate Kþ conductance12). The X-ray crystal structure of the RCK domain of the Escherichia coli Kch channel indicates that this domain may contain a ligand-binding site at its N-terminal half12. To examine whether the N terminus of the mSlo1 RCK domain contains the low-afﬁnity metal-binding site, we ﬁrst studied chimaeric channels between mSlo1 and its homologue mSlo3 (ref. 20)—the activation of which is insensitive to Mg2þ, although it also contains the RCK domain9,12 (Fig. 1). Comparing the sequence of mSlo1 with mSlo3, it is obvious that differences scatter within the N-terminal region of the RCK domain (Fig. 2a). If these differences occur in the metal-binding site, they may result in the difference in Mg2þ sensitivity between these two channels. Figure 1c (left panel) shows that the conductance–voltage (G–V) relation of chimaera C31-I (see Methods for deﬁnition of chimaeras) shifted less than that of mSlo1 when intracellular Mg2þ ciTnohcnerceetaonstetarolaftlio[osMns go(2[fþMM]iggc2a2þþu]si)seedinnnsciorteicvahistaeyndignferoiCnm3t1h0-eIItGoi–s1Vc0ormenlsMaitsi,toewnnhtoewfrCeita3hs1-tthhIIee. idea that the sequence of mSlo3 in this region may have destroyed the metal-binding site. On the other hand, chimaera C13 was activated by Mg2þ (Fig. 1c, right panel), indicating that this region in mSlo1 is sufﬁcient to restore Mg2þ sensitivity in mSlo3. Figure 1d

compares the free energy provided by Mg2þ binding towards the activation of mSlo1, mSlo3 and chimaeric channels9,11 (see Methods and Supplementary Information), and quantitatively demonstrates that the mSlo1 sequence at the N terminus of the RCK domain is essential for Mg2þ-dependent activation.
To identify individual amino acids that are important for Mg2þdependent activation we studied the effects of site-directed mutations on the Mg2þ sensitivity of mSlo1 channels. The core structure of the RCK domain adopts a Rossmann fold with a sixstranded parallel b-sheet (bA–bF) and a-helices (aA–aE) on both sides12. Figure 2a shows the sequence alignment of the N terminus of the RCK domain that includes bA–aC in mSlo1, Drosophila Slo (dSlo)21, mSlo3 and E. coli Kch22 channels. The activation of dSlo channels has a similar Mg2þ sensitivity as that of mSlo1 (data not shown). Residues that are conserved in mSlo1 and dSlo but not in mSlo3 (Fig. 2a) are probably responsible for the difference in Mg2þ sensitivities among these channels. Therefore, in one series of mutations these residues in mSlo1 were mutated into the corresponding amino acids in mSlo3, either individually or in combination (Fig. 2b). In another series of mutations, oxygen-containing residues that are conserved in mSo1 and dSlo—which may possibly be Mg2þ-coordinating—were mutated into Ala or other amino acids as indicated in Fig. 2b. The effects of these mutations on Mg2þ

sensitivity show a clear pattern with regard to the position of

mutated residues (Fig. 2b). Mutations at the interloop connecting

bA and aA (H350N), both N- and C-termini of bB (E374A,

H379G), and towards the N terminus of bC (T396A, Q397C and E399N) reduced Mg2þ sensitivity, whereas mutations at other segments had no signiﬁcant effects on Mg2þ sensitivity. Most

notably, a change in either of two residues, E374A or E399N,

of the mutations E374A and accompanied by any change in

Ca2þ-dependent activation or activation in the absence of Ca2þ and

Mg2þ (Fig. 2c), suggesting that no gross change of channel structure

had resulted from these mutations. E374 is conserved among

mSlo1, dSlo and mSlo3, whereas E399 is conserved in mSlo1 and

dSlo but not in mSlo3 (Fig. 2a), which explains why the chimaera

C31-II lost Mg2þ-sensitivity but C31-I did not (Fig. 1). These results suggest that residues E374 and E399 are part of the low-afﬁnity, metal-binding site, which are exposed to the aqueous solution and are coordinated to the bound Mg2þ ion. Therefore, mutation of these residues should have little impact on the channel structure, but should signiﬁcantly affect Mg2þ binding.
Figure 3 shows the structure of the N terminus of the RCK domain of E. coli Kch channels12 in which the residues at positions corresponding to E374, Q397, E399 and H379 of mSlo1 (N267, N289, D292 and S272 in Kch; Fig. 2a) are substituted by mSlo1 counterparts. A metal-binding site with a bound Mg2þ ion is shown as the result of energy minimization. The Mg2þ ion is coordinated by the side chains of E374 and E399 (located at the N terminus of two adjacent b-strands, bB and bC), and Q397 (in the loop connecting the N terminus of bC with aB). The main chain carbonyl oxygen of Q397 also coordinates to the Mg2þ ion (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with mutational results (Figs 1 and 2). However, the location of the site was unexpected because in other proteins with a Rossman fold—such as the response regulator of bacterial chemotaxis, CheY23, and integrin domain A24—the ligand-binding site is always formed by loops connecting the C terminus of the parallel b-strands to helices25 (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3). Nevertheless, such an organization of metal coordination in mSlo1 is comparable to that found in CheY, in which three Asp side chains and one backbone carbonyl are coordinated to the Mg2þ ion23. The metal site in CheY selectively binds divalent or trivalent cations but does not discriminate between metals on the basis of their size26. Similarly, the low-afﬁnity metal site in mSlo1 channels binds Mg2þ with a comparable afﬁnity as Ca2þ at the millimolar range9,10, which is around the physiological intracellular Mg2þ concentration27. Therefore, in a typical cell, this site is essentially a Mg2þ-binding site.
The results of structural analysis reveal that Q397 is one of the Mg2þ-coordinating residues. The mutation Q397C reduced Mg2þ sensitivity of the channel but did not completely abolish it at 0 or 110 mM [Ca2þ]i (Fig. 4a). Thus, the coordination by the side chain of Q397 is probably replaced either by a water molecule or the thiol group of Cys, and thus maintains some Mg2þ sensitivity. When an Asp residue, which is also negatively charged but with a shorter side

chain, replaced E374 (E374D) or E399 (E399D), the channel remained sensitive to Mg2þ (Fig. 4a), indicating that Mg2þ could still bind to the site. However, Mg2þ sensitivity was reduced by both mutations owing to the change in size of the side chain. The effects of E374D and E399D are not equal (Fig. 4a). This is possibly due to the coordination of the main chain carbonyl of Q397 pulling the metal closer to the backbone of bC (Fig. 3) and thus helping to better accommodate the space change caused by E399D. Notably, when E374 or E399 is replaced by non-charged (Ala or Gln) or positively charged residues (Arg), an increase of [Mg2þ]i from 0 to 10 mM at 0 [Ca2þ]i still activated the channel to a small but observable extent (Figs 2c and 4a). As these mutations should destroy the low-afﬁnity metal-binding site, such a residual sensitivity to Mg2þ is probably derived from Mg2þ binding to the highafﬁnity Ca2þ site, which subsequently activated the channel. Consistent with this idea, at 110 mM [Ca2þ]i, which is saturating for the high-afﬁnity Ca2þ site8, Mg2þ could no longer activate these mutant channels (Figs 2c and 4a). This idea is further supported by the result that the mSlo3 channel, which also lacks Ca2þ sensitivity, was not activated by Mg2þ at 0 [Ca2þ]i (ref. 9) (Fig. 1c).
Figure 4b shows that of the mutations that impaired or abolished Mg2þ sensitivity, none affected the free energy provided by Ca2þ binding towards the activation of the channel when [Ca2þ]i increased from 0 to 110 mM, at an intracellular Mg2þ concentration

of DDG Casensitivity

(Fig. 2b), is not shown on Fig. 4b because the G–V relation was

shifted to right and could not be measured accurately (Fig. 4c).

Instead, a value of DDGCa2ð0MgÞ ¼ 12:5 ^ 0:7 kcal mol21 (n ¼ 6) was measured between 2 and 110 mM [Ca2þ]i and compared with that of mSlo1 channels ð12:0 ^ 0:4 kcal mol21; n ¼ 3); this treat-

ment showed no signiﬁcant difference. Therefore, the structural

components that are affected by these mutations are involved in Mg2þ- but not Ca2þ-dependent activation. On the other hand,

when residues in the interloop connecting aA–bB of mSlo1 were

mutated to corresponding mSlo3 residues (DRDD ! KSGE, Figs 2a and 3), the free energy provided by Ca2þ-binding towards the

activation of the channel was reduced to about one-third of that for

mSlo1 (Fig. 4c). This result indicates an important role of this loop in Ca2þ-dependent activation. However, although this loop is spatially close to the Mg2þ-binding site, mutation DRDD ! KSGE had no effect on Mg2þ sensitivity (Fig. 2b). Similarly, when the tail

domain of mSlo1 is substituted by the tail of mSlo3, the channel loses Ca2þ sensitivity but retains an intact Mg2þ sensitivity9,18.

These results indicate that the tail domain and the interloop connecting aA–bB in the RCK domain may be involved in Ca2þbut not Mg2þ-dependent activation. Thus, distinct structural components are responsible for Ca2þ- and Mg2þ-dependent activation

of BK channels. Not only are the binding sites different, but also the

energy provided by metal binding affects different sets of local

conformational changes that eventually lead to channel opening.

The results from chimaera studies (Fig. 1) demonstrate that only

a small fragment of mSlo1 is necessary and sufﬁcient for restoring Mg2þ sensitivity in mSlo3 channels despite numerous other amino

acid sequence differences between the two. Within this fragment,

H350, H379 and N384 are located in the conserved active site of

other proteins that adopt a Rossman fold12,25 (arrow in Fig. 3). Mutations of these residues affect Mg2þ sensitivity (Fig. 2b). These

results mark the conserved active site as the only area away from the Mg2þ binding site that is important for Mg2þ sensitivity. These residues do not act independently to affect Mg2þ sensitivity, because the reduction of free energy provided by Mg2þ binding towards the

activation of the channel caused by each individual mutation does

not add up to the reduction caused by chimaera C31-I, which

includes all of these individual mutations (Figs 1c and 2b)28.

Consistent with these results, structural analysis indicates that the

side chains of H350 and H379 are close to each other, possibly

interacting by stacking of their aromatic rings (Fig. 3). Thus, it appears that in BK channels Mg2þ binding at the N terminus of

b-strands places an energetic constraint on the conformational

change at the conserved active site located at the C terminus of

b-strands, thereby activating the channel. Given the close proximity

between the RCK domain and the S6 helix that forms the activation

gate13–15 (Fig. 1a), it is possible that the conserved active site directly

interacts with the activation gate.

A

Methods
Mutagenesis and expression All channel constructs were made from the mbr5 clone of mSlo1 (ref. 16) and the complementary DNA of mSlo3 (ref. 20). In C31-I, amino acids 348–386 of mSlo1 are substituted by amino acids 337–375 of mSlo3. In C31-II, amino acids 385–420 of mSlo1 are substituted by amino acids 374–409 of mSlo3. In C13, amino acids 361–405 of mSlo3 are substituted by amino acids 372–416 of mSlo1. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)ampliﬁed regions of all mutants were veriﬁed by sequencing. A PCR error in chimaera C31-I resulted in an additional mutation V553G. As V553 is not conserved between the Mg2þ-sensitive mSlo1 and dSlo, the additional mutation was not corrected. RNA was transcribed in vitro with T3 polymerase (Ambion). We injected 0.05–50 ng of RNA into each Xenopus laevis oocyte 2–6 days before recording.
Electrophysiology Macroscopic currents were recorded from inside-out patches formed with borosilicate pipettes of 0.9–1.8 MQ resistance. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200-B patch clamp ampliﬁer (Axon Instruments) and pulse acquisition software (HEKA Electronik).

Records were digitized at 20-ms intervals and low-pass-ﬁltered at 10 KHz with the 4 pole Bessel ﬁlter of Axopatch. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 140 potassium methanesulphonic acid, 20 HEPES, 2 KCl, 2 MgCl2, pH 7.20. The basal internal solution contained (in mM): 140 potassium methanesulphonic acid, 20 HEPES, 2 KCl, 1 EGTA, pH 7.20. The ‘0 [Ca2þ]i’ solution was the same as the basal internal solution except that it contained 5 mM EGTA, having a free [Ca2þ]i of approximately 0.5 nM that was too low to affect mSlo1 channel activation8. CaCl2 and MgCl2 were added to internal solutions to give the appropriate free [Ca2þ]i and [Mg2þ]i (ref. 9). We obtained all recordings at room temperature (22–24 8C).
Analysis
Relative conductance was determined by measuring tail current amplitudes at 250 mV. G–V relations were ﬁtted with the Boltzmann distribution G=Gmax ¼ 1=½1 þ expðDGAct=kTÞ; where k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is absolute temperature, and DG Act is the free energy change of channel opening. Because voltage, Ca2þ and Mg2þ open the activation gate independently, DGAct is the sum of energy increase provided by voltage ðDGV ¼ 2zeV; where e is the elementary charge and z is the number of equivalent charges), Ca2þ and Mg2þ binding (DG Ca, DG Mg), and that in the absence of Ca2þ and Mg2þ at 0 mV (DG 0)9,11; so DGAct ¼ DGV þ DGCa þ DGMg þ DG0:
The change in Ca2þ- or Mg2þ-binding contribution to DG Act as a result of an increase of [Ca2þ]i or [Mg2þ]i (DDG Ca or DDG Mg) was then calculated based on the shift of the G–V relation: DDGCa ¼ 2DðzeV1=2Þ or DDGMg ¼ 2DðzeV1=2Þ; where V 1/2 is the voltage at half maximum of the G–V relation. Error bars in all ﬁgures show standard error of means.
Molecular modelling
The structure of the RCK domain was generated by residual replacement based on the coordinates of the crystal structure of the RCK domain from the E. coli Kþ channel12. Magnesium ion was manually docked onto the potential Mg2þ-binding site as derived from mutation results. Then, the energy minimization was performed by ﬁxing all backbone atoms and using the Discover Package with Insight II interface (Molecular Simulation). Structural diagrams were made using MolMol29.

functional channel arising from the tetrameric assembly of four asubunits18. Although the transmembrane segments (S1–S6, Fig. 1a) of each a-subunit17,19 share homology with voltage-gated Kþ channels, each a-subunit uniquely contains an extensive C terminus with four additional hydrophobic segments (S7–S10). The C terminus is probably composed of two modular units, as expression in oocytes of separate messages for S0–S8 and S9–S10 peptides produces channels identical to wild-type BK channels20. Whereas the Ca2þ bowl is contained within the S9–S10 peptide, the Cterminal structure with the S7–S8 segments contains the RCK domain, a second potential regulatory element (Fig. 1a, b) that exhibits extensive homology with a number of bacterial Kþ channels. The structures of two prokaryotic RCK domains have been determined12,21 and RCK domains may contain binding sites for a variety of regulatory ligands, including nucleotides22 and cations21.
To address the role of the RCK domain in BK channel regulation, we took advantage of the fact that a homologue of Slo1, the Slo3 pHsensitive Kþ channel, lacks Ca2þ-dependent regulation13,23,24. We focused on residues near folds in the RCK domain that contribute to nucleotide binding in prokaryotic homologues (Fig. 1c). We were

Large conductance, Ca21- and voltage-activated K1 channels (BK) respond to two distinct physiological signals—membrane voltage and cytosolic Ca21 (refs 1, 2). Channel opening is regulated by changes in Ca21 concentration spanning 0.5 mM to 50 mM (refs 2–5), a range of Ca21 sensitivity unusual among Ca21-regulated proteins. Although voltage regulation arises from mechanisms shared with other voltage-gated channels6–8, the mechanisms of Ca21 regulation remain largely unknown. One potential Ca21-regulatory site, termed the ‘Ca21 bowl’, has been located to the large cytosolic carboxy terminus9–11. Here we show that a second region of the C terminus, the RCK domain (regulator of conductance for K1 (ref. 12)), contains residues that deﬁne two additional regulatory effects of divalent cations. One site, together with the Ca21 bowl, accounts for all physiological regulation of BK channels by Ca21; the other site contributes to effects of millimolar divalent cations that may mediate physiological regulation by cytosolic Mg21 (refs 5, 13). Independent regulation by multiple sites explains the large concentration range over which BK channels are regulated by Ca21. This allows BK channels to serve a variety of physiological roles contingent on the Ca21 concentration to which the channels are exposed14,15.
A recent advance in understanding the regulation of BK channels by Ca2þ was the demonstration that distinct, independent binding sites for Ca2þ may explain the range of intracellular Ca2þ concentration ([Ca2þ]i) that regulates channel opening5,13. Over the physiological range of [Ca2þ]i, relatively Ca2þ-selective site(s) mediate channel regulation. In contrast, the effects of [Ca2þ]i in the millimolar range reﬂect a lower sensitivity site showing selectivity for Ca2þ and Mg2þ. Here we deﬁne principal structural elements required for each Ca2þ-dependent regulatory effect. BK channel a-subunits are encoded by a single Slo1 gene16,17, with a

Segment S7 is contained in the RCK structure12. b, Structural approximation of the BK channel RCK domain based on the RCK domain of the E. coli Kþ channel12.
