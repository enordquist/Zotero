Fig. 1. The BK channel. ( A ) Domain to- pology of BK. Domain boundaries are indicated, and the Ca 2+ bowl is illustrated. ( B ) Secondary structure of human BK CTD. Secondary structure elements from the crys- tal structure are aligned to the BK sequence, showing tandem RCK domains (RCK1, blue; RCK2, red) with unresolved segments indi- catedbydashedlines.Deletionmutants D 45, D 42, and D 58 of unresolved segments (se- quences highlighted in red) were character- ized functionally (Fig. 2, C and D). The Ca 2+ bowl is indicated as a thick green line. Site- specific functional data are marked beneath the sequence by vertical lines with references. The complete list of corresponding references is given in table S3. The color of the lines specify the following categories: red, muta- tions around the Ca 2+ bowl; purple, muta- tions facing the voltage sensor domain in our BKmodel(Fig.6);green,mutationsnearthe a F- a G/ a S- a T flexible interface; yellow, splice sites, protein-protein interaction sites, and phosphorylation sites; and blue, additional sites of mutation and modification. Fig. 2. Structure of the BK CTD. ( A ) Ribbon repre- sentations of front and back views of the BK CTD showing RCK1 in blue and RCK2 in red. The Ca 2+ bowl is colored in green, and the Ca 2+ ion is shown as a yellow sphere. Large disordered segments are indicatedasdashedlines.( B )Close-upviewofthe a F- a G/ a S- a T flexible interface. Side chains of hydro- phobic residues in the interface are shown as sticks. ( C ) Channel activation. Currents from inside-out patches are shown for wild-type BK and D 42 deletion mu- tant in the presence of 10 m MCa 2+ . Voltage pulses are – 120 to +180 mV, D V =20mV,andaholding potential of – 60 mV. ( D ) Normalized G - V curves for wild type and deletion mutants in 10 m MCa 2+ . D 45* was tested by means of co-expression of two separated channel segments instead of deletion from a single construct. www.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 329 9 JULY 2010 183 RESEARCH ARTICLE
Two amino acid segments are not visible in the crystal structure (Figs. 1B and 2A). The absence of electron density for the long linker connecting RCK1 to RCK2 is consistent with this region being unstructured and nonessential to function. Deletion of 45 amino acids from this loop in an experiment in which two channel fragments were co-expressed in the same cell resulted in channels with wild-type properties ( D 45*inFig.2D).Paststudiesshowed that the specific amino acid sequence of this region is not important but that it has to reach at least a certain minimum length ( 21 ). The crystal structure explains the length requirement because the end of RCK1 is located a long distance away from the beginning of RCK2 (Fig. 2A, blue dotted linker). The second unstructured region connects a Qto b O in RCK2 (Figs. 1B and 2A). A 42 amino acid dele- tion of this loop yields normally functioning chan- nels ( D 42 in Fig. 2, C and D). Although these two unstructured segments are not essential to basic channel function, they may play a role in higher- level channel regulation because both contain con- sensus sequences for binding SH3 domains (Fig. 1B) ( 12 ). Apairofsaltbridge – forming amino acids was identified in the structure of the Escherichia coli RCK domain ( 14 ). Double mutant cycle analysis of the corresponding amino acids predicted that this salt bridge is conserved in the BK channel, and this is confirmed in the structure: Amino acids K448 and D481, which are well defined in the electron density, show distances in the final model between Lys N- z and Asp O- d 1andO- d 2of2.7Å Fig. 3. The Ca 2+ bowl. ( A ) Experimental electron density at 3.3 Å in the Ca 2+ bowl region contoured at 1.0 s above the mean density, where s is the RMSD of the density. ( B and C )Weighted2f o -f c electron density at 3.0Å after refinement contoured at 1.0 s and 4.0 s , respectively. The final refined model is shown as sticks, with most side chains removed for clarity. ( D ) Structure of the Ca 2+ bowl, showing key residues coordinating the Ca 2+ ion (yellow sphere). Fig. 4.
