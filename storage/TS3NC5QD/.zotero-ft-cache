Abstract
Ion channels are regulated by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. Evidence for regulation of channels by tyrosine phosphorylation comes primarily from investigations of the effects of growth factors, which act through receptor tyrosine kinases. The purpose of the present work is to summarize evidence for the regulation of ion channels by integrins, through their downstream, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. We review both direct and indirect evidence for this regulation, with particular emphasis on Ca2+-activated K+ and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We then discuss the critical roles that cytoskeletal, focal-adhesion, and channel-associated scaffolding proteins may play in localizing nonreceptor tyrosine kinases to the vicinity of ion channels. We conclude by speculating on the physiological signiﬁcance of these regulatory pathways.

INTRODUCTION
Ion channels are the targets of many intracellular signaling pathways, including protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Indeed, nearly every type of voltage-gated K+, Ca2+, and Na+ channel is regulated to some extent by phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues on intracellular domains of the channel (1,2).

properties, including voltage sensitivity and calcium sensitivity, and thereby dramatically control the electrophysiological properties of a cell. In addition to serine/threonine phosphorylation, considerable recent evidence suggests that ion channels are also regulated by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (1,3–7).
Evidence for regulation of ion channels by tyrosine phosphorylation comes primarily from investigations of the effects of growth factors. Growth factors, which act through receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), regulate the long-term expression of ion channels (8,9) but

also have acute actions on channel activity. Receptor PTKs are characterized by an extracellular, ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, a kinase-catalytic domain and cytoplasmic regions responsible for coordinating the subsequent activity of signaling molecules. Signal transduction involves growth factor (ligand) binding to the extracellular domain, dimerization of the receptor proteins, and autophosphorylation of the receptor. Receptor autophosphorylation then creates phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, which form docking sites for signaling molecules. The combination of these signaling molecules determines the speciﬁcity of individual receptor PTKs (10).
Nonreceptor PTKs can also regulate ion channels. These enzymes play a prominent role in signaling pathways downstream from integrins and other adhesion molecules. Nonreceptor PTKs are found in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells, but the largest family is the cytoplasmic Src (sarcoma virus tyrosine kinase) family (11), consisting of eight members, including Src, Fyn, and Yes, that are ubiquitously expressed. Regulation of Src family members is highly conserved: Autophosphorylation of a kinase domain tyrosine leads to increased kinase activity, whereas phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue near the C terminus represses activity (12). Many stimuli, including receptor PTKs, Gprotein coupled receptors, and integrins have been implicated in Src activation, suggesting that this family of kinases is a key point of integration for many signal transduction pathways. Another relevant nonreceptor PTK is pp125FAK, which is discretely localized to cellular focal adhesions and has been shown to colocalize with integrins. FAK is a substrate for integrindependent tyrosine phosphorylation and becomes enzymatically active upon phosphorylation, serving as a scaffold for the binding and localization of other proteins to the focal adhesion (13). Activation of Src family members and FAK serves as a key integration mechanism for a number of extracellular signaling pathways.
The regulation of ion channels by growth factors and receptor PTKs has been reviewed,

to some extent, previously (3,4,6,7). The purpose of the present work is to summarize evidence for the regulation of ion channels by integrins and integrin-linked tyrosine kinases. We review both direct and indirect evidence for this regulation. We then discuss the critical roles that the cytoskeleton and channel-associated scaffolding proteins may play in localizing PTKs to the vicinity of ion channels. When possible, we speculate on the physiological signiﬁcance of these regulatory pathways.
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN INTEGRINS AND ION CHANNELS
Integrins are a family of membrane-spanning glycoproteins that link the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton. Integrins are composed of α–β heterodimers with extracellular domains that bind ECM proteins and short cytoplasmic tails that associate with focal adhesion proteins (14,15). As mentioned earlier, integrin activation is a well-known trigger of intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation cascades. Integrin engagement by multivalent ligands, including extracellular matrix proteins, induces receptor clustering, the recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins to the focal adhesion, and the activation of nonreceptor PTKs (16,17). Because integrins lack intrinsic enzymatic activity, they rely on the activation of other cytoplasmic signaling molecules, including FAK and Src. Integrin interaction with FAK leads to FAK autophosphorylation, to the creation of a binding site for the Src SH2 domain, and, ultimately, to Src activation (18). Src then phosphorylates additional sites on FAK to allow binding of other signaling molecules and scaffolding proteins (19,20). This process leads to the assembly of complex signaling molecules at the focal adhesion site and organizes further downstream signaling events (15). Many of the signaling pathways activated by receptor PTKs overlap with integrin-mediated signaling pathways, utilizing the same PTKs through different adaptor proteins (21,22).
Integrins may play a role in directing the localization of ion channels. In neuroblastoma

cells, neurite outgrowth is initiated by hyperpolarization subsequent to β1-integrin-dependent adhesion on extracellular matrix (23). G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels are implicated in this hyperpolarization, although the mechanism and possible coupling of these channels to β1 integrins has not been elucidated. In oocytes, GIRK1 and GIRK4 channels coimmunoprecipitate with an endogenous β1-integrin subunit (24). The Asp-Gly-Arg (RGD) sequence is thought to be an integrinspecific recognition sequence contained in many extracellular matrix proteins and this sequence is also found in the ﬁrst membranespanning (extracellular) region of all known GIRK channels, but not in any other cloned K+ channels (24). Interestingly, mutation of the RGD site (to RGE) on the channel decreases or eliminates GIRK current after expression of the mutant channel. However, RGD peptides, applied extracellularly, do not modulate GIRK channel current. This evidence suggests that the RGD site is important for insertion of the channel into the cell membrane, rather than for acute regulation of the channel (24). However, only the aspartate residue, not the entire RGD motif, appears to be important for proper GIRK processing and function (25). Thus, the functional association between GIRK channels and β1 integrins remains uncertain at this time.
There are other examples of links between the expression of ion channels and integrins. HERG (ether-a-go-go-related gene) K+ channels have recently been shown to play a role in regulation of integrin expression. Adherence of FLG 29.1 preosteoclasts on fibronectin (FN) activates HERG current and the activation is sustained by β1-integrin-subunit activation. The sustained activation of HERG current appears necessary for upregulation of αvβ3 integrin in these cells (26). The cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane regulator, a Cl– channel, functions as an adhesion receptor for at least two types of bacteria (27). A member of a closely related family of Ca2+-activated Cl– channels, CLCA2, serves as a β4-integrin-binding partner for adhesion between endothelial cells and breast cancer cells (27).

In addition to a possible role in channel localization, evidence from a large number of studies indicates that integrins play a functional role in ion channel regulation. For example, integrin-dependent adhesion initiates Ca2+ inﬂux in endothelial cells (28,29), ﬁbroblasts (30), osteoclasts (31–33), leukocytes (34), hepatocytes (35), smooth-muscle cells (36) and epithelial cells (37). Integrins are involved in the mechanical modulation of neurotransmitter release (38,39). Integrin-dependent adhesion inititiates hyperpolarization in neurons (23,40). Integrin-speciﬁc peptides (RGD, LDV) cause vasodilation and vasoconstriction in isolated skeletal muscle arterioles (41), responses that are blocked by inhibitors of K+ and Ca2+ channels, respectively (42). Integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation cascades have been implicated in a number of processes that involve ion channels (43). The majority of these studies are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
Relatively few studies have deﬁned speciﬁc interactions between an integrin and a channel. The exceptions are noted in Table 1. For the sake of brevity, we will discuss only a few selected studies. KCa channels in erythroleukemia cells are activated following cell contact with ﬁbronectin-coated microspheres, which are known to engage and aggregate several β1 and β3 integrins. Over a time-course of 800 s, there is an increase in whole cell KCa current and a 40mV hyperpolarization (40). Although this evidence suggests possible signaling between β1 and/or β3 integrins and KCa channels, singlechannel currents were also activated away from the pipet attachment site, leaving open the possibility that the channels were activated by global or localized increases in intracellular calcium rather than by direct association with integrins. A more recent study by the same group shows that HERG current in an osteoclast cell line is activated by adhesion on FN. The exact signaling pathway was not deﬁned, but it involves a pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi-protein (26).
More direct evidence for a functional association between channels and integrins exists for T-lymphocytes. In T-cells, Kv1.3 channels are

necessary for activation of β1 integrins and
subsequent integrin-dependent adhesion and
migration (44). This mechanism underlies the
activation of T-cell adhesion by elevation of extracellular K+ in the absence of any speciﬁc
receptor-mediated event and accounts for the
ability of substance P, which inhibits Kv1.3 channels, to inhibit T-cell adhesion. Although it
has not yet been tested whether the signaling between Kv1.3 channels and β1 integrins works in reverse, Kv1.3 and β1 integrins coimmunoprecipitate, suggesting that direct physical
association of these molecules underlies their
functional interaction (44).
Several lines of evidence suggest that cal-
cium channels are acutely regulated by inte-
grin-dependent signaling. Most of this
evidence is summarized in Table 2. In many
cell types, integrin engagement triggers both intracellular Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx
across the plasma membrane (65), and these
two processes are often coupled. This phe-
nomenon can be illustrated by a discussion of
endothelial cell–integrin interactions. Integrindependent adhesion initiates Ca2+ influx in
endothelial cells (28). Application of the ECM
protein, vitronectin, or a polyclonal antibody to αvβ3 integrin stimulates endothelial cell Ca2+ release and Ca2+ inﬂux (29). These lig-
ands also stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation
of multiple endothelial cell proteins (66). Both Ca2+ inﬂux and protein phosphorylation are
blocked by soluble tyrosine kinase inhibitors (29). The ion channel responsible for Ca2+
inﬂux has not been identiﬁed, but it is likely to be the so-called “store-operated Ca2+ influx
channel.” The current most likely to be associated with this process is a small inward, Ca2+-
selective current in nonexcitable cells, termed Icrac, for Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ current (67). Molecularly, the best candidates for Icrac are the Trp (transient receptor potential)
family of proteins (68) and the channellike
intestinal calcium transporter CaT1 (69,70).
Recombinant Trp channels share many, but not
all, characteristics of Icrac (71,72), although heterologous combinations of Trp isoforms in
native cells may account for the unique char-

acteristics of some endogenous store-operated currents (73,74). A recent study shows that heterologously expressed CaT1 protein is nearly indistinguishable from Icrac (70). Of relevance to the possible regulation of store-operated Ca2+ current by integrins is the recent ﬁnding that αvβ3 ligands activate store-operated Ca2+ current in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (75). Additional evidence indicates that Icrac can be regulated by tyrosine kinases (76–79) and that its full activation requires cytoskeletal proteins (80,81) and small GTPases (82).
In contrast to the circumstantial evidence for regulation of Ca2+ current in nonexcitable cells by integrins, the evidence for regulation of voltage-gated calcium channels is much stronger. In vascular smooth muscle, the L-type calcium channel is regulated by at least three different integrins. Whole-cell recordings from vascular myocytes show that soluble ligands of the αvβ3 integrin, such as RGD peptides, vitronectin, and ﬁbronectin fragments, inhibit L-type current (59). Interestingly, insoluble αvβ3 ligands (i.e., ligands attached to microspheres) also inhibit current (59). This is somewhat counter to what might be expected, because soluble (monovalent, nonclustering) integrin ligands do not trigger the entire ensemble of downstream signaling events (i.e., cytoskeletal protein redistribution and tyrosine phosphorylation) typical of integrin–multivalent ligand interaction (83). Rather, monovalent integrin ligands are thought to act by disrupting existing interactions between integrins and their insoluble ligands. Because both soluble and insoluble αvβ3 integrin ligands produce the same effects on smooth-muscle-cell calcium current, both may be triggering the same signaling pathway involving Ca2+ channels. The signaling pathway by which αvβ3 integrin regulates the L-type channel is not known, but it appears to be insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Wu, unpublished observations). In contrast to inhibition of Ca2+ current by αvβ3 ligands, soluble ligands (LDV peptide) of the laminin receptor, α4β1, enhance L-type calcium current (84). However, the α4 integrin antibody does not modulate current, although pretreat-

ment with the antibody blocks the LDV response. These observations suggest that the signaling pathways between these two integrins and the L-type Ca2+ channel in this tissue are fundamentally different. Whether either signaling pathway involves changes in the phosphorylation state of the channel is not known.
Substantially more information is available about how insoluble α5β1 integrin ligands modulate the L-type calcium channel. L-Type calcium current in vascular smooth muscle is potentiated up to twofold by insoluble α5β1 ligands, and this potentiation is blocked by soluble tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including genistein, piceatannol, and the Src-familyspecific inhibitor, PP2. Tyrosine phosphatase inhibition increases basal L-type calcium current (60,85). Although it might be argued that these inhibitors lack specificity, cell dialysis with antibodies to c-Src or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) also block potentiation of current, with a lesser but significant effect on basal current. Recent experiments demonstrate many of the same effects of α5β1 ligands in heterologously expressed L-type Ca2+ channels (Gui et al., unpublished observations), indicating that these conclusions do not only apply to freshly dissociated smoothmuscle cells, which could potentially be altered by enzyme treatment. These observations also fit with data from other types of smooth muscle where Ca2+ current is increased by intracellular application of constitutively active Src kinase (86), increased by c-Src activating peptide (87), and inhibited by a c-Src monoclonal antibody (88).
Similarities between the actions of integrin ligands and the growth factor PDGF (plateletderived growth factor) on the L-type Ca2+ channel also support a role for regulation of the channel by tyrosine phosphorylation. PDGF, which stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple smooth-muscle proteins, enhances Ltype calcium current (88,89) and increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the pore-forming channel subunit α1C (Cav1.2b). In PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle, α1C coimmunoprecipitates with c-Src (88). c-Src also interacts with the

neuronal isoform of the α1 Ca2+ channel subunit. In cerebellar granule neurons, α1C is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), resulting in potentiation of L-type current (90,91). This effect can be duplicated with recombinant α1C (Cav1.2c) expressed in SH-SY5Y cells. c-Src mediates this response because expression of kinase-dead Src, or application of PP2, blocks potentiation of current (92). Kinase assays using lysates from neuroblastoma cells expressing α1C show that puriﬁed Src kinase phosphorylates Y2122 on the α1C C terminus. Furthermore, point mutation of Y2122F prevents tyrosine phosphorylation and IGF-1 potentiation of current (92). Because Cav1.2b and Cav1.2c share identical sequences in this region, it is likely that Y2122 also mediates potentiation of current in smooth muscle by both PDGF and integrin ligands. In fact, a peptide designed to compete with phosphorylation of this region of the channel prevents potentiation of current in vascular smooth muscle by α5β1 integrin ligands (60) and in Cav1.2b channels expressed in HEK 293 cells (Gui et al., unpublished observations).
In smooth-muscle cells, intracellular dialysis with antibodies to two integrin-associated cytoskeletal proteins, paxillin and vinculin, also blocks regulation of L-type current by α5β1 ligands. The ability of vinculin and paxillin antibodies to do this is likely the result of their interference with the assembly of Src or another nonreceptor PTK on an intracellular scaffold of focal adhesion proteins, rather than a direct interaction with the channel. Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains in these proteins enable them to associate with PTKs (14). As mentioned earlier, the C termini of Cav1.2b and Cav1.2c contain at least two proline-rich domains that may interact with SH3 domains in Src, Lyn, and Hck tyrosine kinases (93) and possibly with SH3 domains in docking, adaptor, or scaffolding proteins. Deletion of one prolinerich region results in increased channel current, suggesting that it is constitutively involved in channel inhibition (94). However, it is not yet known whether phosphorylation

of the α1C C terminus by any of these PTKs alters this inhibitory property.
Collectively, these observations suggest that L-type Ca2+ channels are regulated by multiple intracellular pathways downstream from αvβ3, α5β1, and α4β1 integrins. What is the physiological relevance of these observations? We propose that the extracellular matrix exerts constitutive control over the major calcium-permeable ion channel in vascular smooth muscle and that acute regulation of calcium signaling by integrins may occur under physiological and pathological conditions in blood vessels. This conclusion is consistent with evidence that integrin ligands and ECM proteins can acutely regulate vascular tone. For example, peptides containing the integrin-speciﬁc RGD (Arg-GlyAsp) and LDV (Leu-Asp-Val) amino acid sequences cause dilation and constriction, respectively, of isolated, pressurized skeletal muscle arterioles (42,95). The dilation to RGD peptides is associated with a fall in intracellular calcium (96) and is blocked by a β3-integrin antibody (95). In contrast, α5β1- and α4β1-integrin ligands produce constriction of the same arterioles. This evidence suggests that extracellular matrix proteins have the potential to inﬂuence vascular tone through an interaction with integrins, pointing to a possible role for these mechanisms in tissue injury responses (97). Whether this occurs in other cell types is not known, but it is interesting to note that the ECM protein, FN, and the nerve growth factor (NGF) acutely enhance high-voltage-activated Ca2+ currents in molluscan neurons (64). FN also enhances the frequency of action potential ﬁring (W. Wildering, see Note Added in Proof) in that tissue, suggesting that a matrix–integrin–calcium channel signaling axis may acutely regulate electrical excitability of those cells.
Another extracellular matrix protein, laminin, modulates L-type Ca2+ current in atrial myocytes by a different mechanism. Interactions between laminin and β1 integrins reduces β1adrenergic modulation of L-type Ca2+ current but enhances β2-adrenergic modulation of current (62). Additionally, the laminin–β1 integrin interaction inhibits adenylate cyclase and

thereby alters L-type Ca2+ current (63). The sig-
naling pathways involved in these actions of
laminin remain to be elucidated; however, both
effects require an intact actin cytoskeleton (62,63). Muscarinic inhibition of L-type Ca2+ current, and muscarinic activation of K+ current, is absent in β1-integrin–/– cardiomyocytes (98). Interestingly, β-adrenergic modulation of the Ca2+ current is unaffected in this knockout (98),
an observation that conﬂicts somewhat with the
above reports (62,63). It is possible that this
mode of regulation in cardiomyocytes compen-
sates for lack of direct tyrosine phosphorylation by Src of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel
(Cav1.2a), which has a substantially different C terminus and does not contain the critical tyro-
sine residue required for Cav1.2b and Cav1.2c potentiation (92).
Other adhesion proteins are also known to
interact with ion channels. For example, the
adhesion molecule PECAM, is constituitively
expressed on endothelial cells, and a PECAM antibody evokes [Ca2+]i increases in HUVECs (99) through activation of a nonselective cation
current. Activation of this current requires an
intact PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain and Src
kinase activity (100). Tenascin-C is an extracellu-
lar adhesive glycoprotein composed of a series
of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats,
a ﬁbrinogen-like region, and a series of fibronectin-like regions (101). Neuronal Na+
channels bind to tenascin-C with high afﬁnity as
well as to the related protein, tenascin-R, which
lacks several of the ﬁbronectin repeats (102). The Na+ channel β2-subunit contains an Ig domain
with close sequence similarity to the neural cell
adhesion molecule contactin/F3 (103).
Contactin/F3 binds tenascin and related ECM
proteins. Additionally, the EGF-like domains of tenascin-R have the potential to regulate Na+
channels through interactions with PTKs.
Although a functional role for these extracellular proteins in the regulation of the Na+ channel
has not been demonstrated, it has been specu-
lated that secretion of the proteins by neuronal
support cells, such as oligodendrocytes, may direct localization of Na+ channels on the corre-
sponding neuronal cell membrane (102).

Regulation of Ion Channels by Integrins

THE CHANNEL-PROTEIN KINASE REGULATORY COMPLEX
An emerging concept in the ﬁeld of ion channel regulation is that modulation of channel function by phosphorylation requires the formation of a multiprotein complex. The poreforming α-subunits of many channels bind to auxilliary channel subunits, but they also associate with scaffolding proteins that play essential roles in channel localization and activity (3). Scaffolding proteins link signaling enzymes, substrates, and potential effectors (such as channels) into a multiprotein signaling complex that may be anchored to the cytoskeleton. In addition to an obvious role in targeting the channel to a particular location on the cell membrane, there are at least three advantages to having an ion channel in a multiprotein complex. First, there is a large increase in efﬁciency of the kinetic reaction when an enzyme is localized with its substrate and effector in a microenvironment with restricted diffusion (104). Second, the anchoring of an enzyme complex to a channel may be necessary for the extremely rapid transmission of signals required to regulate some channels (105). Third, compartmentalization may be essential for determining speciﬁcity in signal transduction pathways (106).
There appear to be many families of scaffolding and adaptor proteins that potentially could be involved in organizing ion channels into signaling complexes and regulating function by coupling those channels to protein kinases. For serine–threonine kinases, prominent families are the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase), AKAP (A-kinase associated) proteins, and GKAP (G-kinase associated) proteins (107). INAD (inactivation-no-after potential D) is another example of a multiprotein signaling complex. INAD is a Drosophila protein containing ﬁve PDZ domains (PSD-95/SAPSO, Dlg and 20-1 domains) that link together most of the proteins involved directly in phototransduction. This multiprotein complex includes rhodopsin, calmodulin, the putative store-operated Ca2+ channels Trp and Trpl, and the protein

kinases PLC and PKC (105,108). INAD may serve as a template for understanding how other channels are regulated in a multiprotein complex.
Evidence that scaffolding proteins can mediate kinase-channel interactions is perhaps best established for the AKAP family of proteins (109). AKAPs serve to localize both kinases and phosphatases to multiprotein effector complexes that include K+ and Ca2+ channels (110). A conserved AKAP anchoring motif directs dimerized PKA subunits to a particular subcellular target (111). For example, forskolin and cAMP potentiate ROMK1 (a Kir1.x subfamily of channels expressed in epithelial cells) current in native renal secretory cells (112). This potentiation is lost when ROMK1 is expressed in oocytes but restored if AKAP79 is coexpressed with the channel (112). AKAP15/18 is required for protein kinase A (PKA) potentiation of L-type Ca2+ channels in cardiac (113), skeletal (114), and vascular smooth muscle (115). AKAPs have also been implicated in the regulation of KCa channels (116) and the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (117). AKAP79 associates with the β2-adrenergic receptor and with MAGUK proteins, which, in turn, are coupled to glutamate-gated ion channels. AKAP79 has the potential to form part of a scaffold upon which PKA and PP2B (protein phosphatase 2B) may dually regulate the coupling of β2-adrenergic receptors and glutamate channels (110). Thus, AKAPs appear to be capable of assembling signaling complexes by virtue of their associations with ion channels and other scaffolding proteins. It is possible that AKAPs represent a general scheme for kinase regulation of channels and that similar families of adaptor proteins associated with other kinases, perhaps PTKs, will soon be identiﬁed.
ROLE OF THE CYTOSKELETON IN REGULATION OF ION CHANNELS
The cytoskeleton provides a backbone upon which scaffolding proteins are organized and thereby positioned to link kinases to ion chan-

nels. The cytoskeleton is a highly structured, three-dimensional network composed of three main components: actin filaments, microtubules (containing tubulin), and intermediate ﬁlaments (containing vimentin, neuroﬁlament, etc.). Each component has a unique functional and structural role in the cell and the syncitial nature of the cytoskeletal network implies the existence of complex interrelationships among the various components. A large number of accessory proteins are involved in assembly, disassembly, and crosslinking of each of these elements. The prevailing view of the cytoskeleton, the tensegrity model (118), proposes a syncitium of compression-resistant struts (microtubules) suspended between various elastic elements (actin and intermediate ﬁlaments). Other structural proteins, including ezrin, ankyrin, spectrin, ﬁlamin, α-actinin, and talin, are required for anchoring the cytoskeleton into the plasma membrane and/or tethering it to other plasma membrane proteins.
There is increasing evidence to support a critical role for the cytoskeleton in the regulation of ion channels. One line of evidence is that cytoskeletal proteins are directly associated with ion channels. For example, the cGMP-gated cation channel of rod photoreceptors associates with spectrin (119). Accessory proteins associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor attach to the cytoskeleton (e.g., SAP97 binds band 4.1, an actin, and spectrin-binding protein [120]). The epithelial Na+ channel associates with spectrin (121). NR1 and NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor/channel bind to soluble tubulin and αactinin (122,123). The list of these interactions is extensive and the reader is referred to several recent reviews for more detail (3,111,124–126). A second line of evidence is that cytoskeletal proteins are involved in various aspects of ion channel function. For example, the Kv4.2 channel interacts with the actin-binding protein ﬁlamin in cerebellar and hippocampal neurons (127), such that the magnitude of current is much greater when ﬁlamin is coexpressed with the channel than when the channel is expressed alone (127). At least one β-subunit of

the Kv1.1 channel confers fast inactivation to the channel’s α-subunit (128,129) and this
property depends on the interaction of the sub-
units with F-actin and the phosphorylation state of the α-subunit (130). For Kv1.5 channels, disruption of the actin network using cytochalasin D or antisense constructs to α-actinin-2
result in increased Kv1.5 current, either by controlling channel gating or expression (131).
Disruption of actin ﬁlaments in retinal bipolar
cells also leads to activation of voltage-gated K+ current (132). Collectively, these observa-
tions suggest that the actin cytoskeleton exerts
a tonic, inhibitory effect on at least several types of K+ channels.
The actin network appears to exhibit a different effect on Na+ and Ca2+ channels. Actin
filament disruption with cytochalasin D inhibits L-type Ca2+ current in vascular smooth
muscle (133) and alters the time-course of activation of the cardiac Na+ channel (134). The net effect of actin ﬁlament disruption on Na+ and Ca2+ currents is to enhance current and alter the shape of the cardiac cell Ca2+ transient
(135). Antibodies to F-actin are reported to alter the gating kinetics of the cardiac Na+ channel
by inducing a second open state and causing
prolonged opening bursts (134). Fast inactivation of the Na+ channel has been proposed to
be controlled by a triplet of amino acid
residues at the cytoplasmic II–IV linker region (136). Whether this region of the Na+ channel is
directly associated with cytoskeletal or scaf-
folding proteins is not yet clear.
An indirect way in which the actin network
can inﬂuence ion channel gating is by control-
ling the translocation of protein kinases (133).
Actin and vinculin are involved in transloca-
tion of c-Src (137) in response to growth factors
or thrombin (138,139). Because Src has been shown to phosphorylate K+ (140–143) and Ca2+
channels (60,88,92), disruption of actin fila-
ments could alter the constitutive phosphory-
lation of those channels by Src or other
Src-family kinases.
In addition to actin, other cytoskeletal pro-
teins are implicated in the regulation of ion
channels. Ankyrin is a large intracellular attach-

ment protein involved in connecting spectrin and actin to the cell membrane. Ankryin and spectrin associate with voltage-gated Na+ channels in neurons (144). Ankyrin is required for clustering of Na+ channels at nodes of Ranvier (145), axon hillocks (146), and in retinal ganglia (147). Cerebellum-specific knockout of ankyrinG results in an increased threshold for action potential firing in cerebellar neurons (146). Mouse cardiac myocytes lacking ankyrinB show reduced Na+ channel current density and exhibit a variety of alterations in the function of the remaining cardiac Na+ channels, most notably slowed recovery from inactivation (148). The defect resembles, in some respects, the action of selective Na+ channel blockers (149). Intracellular dialysis with antibodies to β-spectrin or ankyrin is reported to alter gating kinetics of the cardiac Na+ channel (134). Therefore, coupling of the Na+ channel to ankyrin appears to be required for normal localization and function of this channel in heart and brain.
Ezrin–radixin–moesin (ERM) proteins are thought to serve as regulatable scaffolds that anchor actin filaments to the plasma membrane (150). Ezrin is identical to the 78-kDa AKAP that regulates type-II A-kinase in gastric parietal cells (151). Ezrin has also been identiﬁed as the AKAP that links PKA II to the CFTR chloride channel in secretory cells (117). It is noteworthy that ezrin is a well-known target of protein phosphorylation: It contains a PIP2 binding site (152) and is a substrate for EGFR tyrosine kinase (153).
The ERM proteins also appear to be essential for both Rho- and Rac-induced cytoskeletal effects (154). Rho, Rac and Cdc42 belong to a family of low-molecular-weight GTPases that interact with ERM proteins and play essential roles in organizing the actin cytoskeleton. One downstream target of Rho, p160ROCK, is known to phosphorylate myosin light-chain kinase and phosphatase to regulate assembly of actin–myosin ﬁlament bundles (155). This process is critical for reorganization of focal adhesions and adhesion-molecule clustering. These small GTPases are therefore down-

stream targets of integrin and growth factor signaling pathways (156) and are implicated as mediators of inside-out integrin signaling (157). Over a dozen target proteins have been identiﬁed for Rac and Cdc42 (150), including ion channels. For example, Rac 1 and Cdc42 are involved in the regulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ current by bradykinin (158) and in the regulation of Icrac (82).
Other downstream products of integrin and Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling (159) are also known to modulate ion channels. In cortical neurons, the L-type calcium channel is phosphorylated in response to βamyloid, which accumulates extracellularly (160). This process is not sensitive to serine–threonine kinase inhibitors but is attenuated by PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK (160). The use of antisense oligonucleotides to modify MAPK expression also reduces β-amyloidinduced Ca2+ accumulation, presumably through the L-type Ca2+ channel (160). Similarly, another small GTP-binding protein, Ras, mediates enhancement of mesangial cell Ca2+ current by Src and PDGF (161). This effect is speciﬁc for Ras, but not Rho or Rap 1. Several other studies support a role for Ras in the regulation of ion channels. Injection of H-Ras oncogenes into neurons enhances calcium currents (162–164), transfection of AtT-20 cells with Ras alters K+
channel current, and tetrodotoxin (TTX) sensitivity of Na+ channels (164,166), p21ras inhibits coupling of muscarinic receptors to inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels in atrial cells (167–169), and Ras mediates acute inhibition of PC12 cell Na+ channels by growth factors (170). Ras is necessary for the assembly of a signaling complex involving a mesangial cell Ca2+ channel, the PDGF-β receptor, and the adaptor proteins Grb2 and SOS (Son-of-sevenless) (161). Ras may mediate the enhancement of voltage-gated Ca2+ current by NGF and Src kinase in dorsal root ganglion neurons (171). Future studies are needed to elucidate how these small GTPbinding proteins interact with PTKs, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), and their putative multiprotein signaling complexes that regulate ion channels.

Davis et al.

The other major component of the cytoskeleton, the microtubule system, has also been implicated in the regulation of ion channels. Colchicine, a microtubule disrupter, decreases the inactivation time constant of the cardiac Ltype channel, thereby increasing the probability that the channel is in its closed state (172). The microtubule stabilizer taxol shifts the activation of cardiac Na+ channels in such a way as to decrease the threshold for channel activation, which would potentially produce premature cardiac contractions (134). Microtubules appear to be involved in the inactivation of Ca2+ currents in snail neurons (173) but not in cardiac myocytes (133,174). Because microtubules are thought to represent compression-resistant struts that counteroppose contractile forces directed through the actin ﬁlament network (175), it is therefore likely that their disruption could result in secondary rearrangement of actin ﬁlaments and associated actin-binding proteins.
It should be noted that the specificity of cytoskeleton-disrupting agents must be considered when interpreting electrophysiological studies in which cytochalasin, colchicine, and so forth have been used. For example, low doses of colchicine that do not disrupt microtubules nevertheless inhibit the L-type Ca2+ channel in cardiac myocytes (albeit with less inhibition than at higher doses), implying that this agent works by an additional mechanism, perhaps by a direct block of the channel (133). Colchicine is known to competitively antagonize glycine receptors (176). Actin ﬁlament and microtubule disruption also produce a wide variety of effects on cell function that are unrelated to ion channels. For example, colchicine stimulates PKA activity by disrupting microtubules (177), which would indirectly alter the phosphorylation state of several types of channels. Many studies of the role of actin and tubulin in the regulation of particular channels do not appear to have addressed this issue. Therefore, elucidation of a role for specific cytoskeletal elements in the regulation of ion channels awaits the development of more selective tools to alter the function of these cytoskeletal proteins.

In summary, the regulation of ion channels by integrins most likely requires multiple cytoskeletal and focal adhesion proteins. The focal adhesion represents an insertion point for actin stress ﬁbers in the cell membrane and an intracellular scaffold for the assemblage of many signaling and cytoskeletal components (14). Following integrin-dependent adhesion, kinases such as FAK, Src, phospholipase C (PLC)-γ, and Rho GTPase, as well as adaptor proteins such as Grb2, Sos, and Shc, are recruited to the focal adhesion underneath the ECM–integrin binding site (14,156). The process of recruitment requires, at a minimum, several cytoskeletal proteins and the small Gproteins that assemble them. Focal adhesions also contain a number of proteins such as paxillin, α-actinin, vinculin, talin, Cas, Crk, and so forth that are necessary for the association and regulation of PTKs and their targets. Although it is speculative at this time, it is possible to draw many parallels between the function of the focal adhesion and the function of channel–protein kinase complexes documented earlier in other systems.
CONCLUSIONS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE
Evidence is accumulating to suggest that many types of ion channels are regulated, not only by growth factors through receptor PTKs but also by integrins through nonreceptor PTKs. Clearly, the study of interactions between integrins, or other adhesion proteins, and ion channels is in its infancy. Nevertheless, several studies already provide strong evidence that ECM proteins and other integrin ligands can modulate ion channels through nonreceptor PTKs. Given the increasing evidence for synergy between receptor PTKs and integrin signaling pathways, this suggests a paradigm whereby growth factors and cell–cell and cell–substrate interactions might acutely regulate cell function through ion channels.
The relevance of most of these interactions remains to be determined. It is possible that

integrins only regulate ion channels under pathological conditions such as tissue ischemia, reperfusion injury, wound repair, and vascular wall remodeling. However, the well-established role for integrins in transducing mechanical force across the cell membrane (30,178,179), leaves open the possibility that mechanical forces may be constantly transmitted through integrins or other cell-adhesion proteins to regulate ion channels. Both possibilities need to be more thoroughly investigated with electrophysiological studies.
Figure 1 shows an illustration of the possible interactions between ECM integrins and the Ltype Ca2+ channel in vascular smooth muscle. These mechanisms summarize the studies discussed in the body of this review. Signaling pathways involving at least three different integrins have the potential to regulate this channel. Soluble integrin ligands (matricryptins)

that might be formed from the degradation of ECM (e.g., collagen) during tissue injury responses (e.g., wounding, ischemia/reperfusion, neutrophil invasion) can act on αvβ3 and α4β1 integrins to inhibit or potentiate, respectively, L-type Ca2+ current (97). Inhibition would lead to vasodilation, because the channel is partially open at the resting potential of VSM; potentiation of current would lead to vasoconstriction. In addition, insoluble (bound) ligands, such as matrix proteins, may also constitutively regulate the channel; vitronectin (VN), through αvβ3, may exert inhibitory signals; FN, through α5β1, may exert excitatory signals. Both acute and chronic conditions might alter the balance of these signaling mechanisms. For example, mechanical forces (stretch, shear stress) might modulate interactions between FN and α5β1 or interactions between VN and αvβ3. Likewise, long-term

changes in the assembly or expression of ECM or integrins could shift the balance of these signaling mechanisms that converge on the primary Ca2+ inﬂux pathway in VSM.
Given the above discussion, the potential exists for a number of common pathophysiological states to demonstrate involvement of an extracellular matrix–integrin–ion channel axis. Examples pertaining to vascular physiology include dysfunctions associated with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Both states have been shown to be associated with alterations to the extracellular matrix component of the blood vessel wall, including increased deposition of fibronectin (180–183). An altered complement of matrix proteins could conceivably alter cell signaling initiated through integrin binding and/or by alterations in the mechanical properties of the vessel wall. In experimental diabetes, accumulation of matrix proteins in the arteriolar wall has been suggested to decrease distensibility and, consequently, impair smooth-muscle Ca2+ entry and mechanotransduction (183). Similarly, impaired shear-stress-mediated mechanotransduction in endothelial cells could limit Ca2+ entry via pathways such as store-depletion-dependent Ca2+ entry, thus contributing to the decreased nitric oxide production seen in hypertension (184).
In addition to an involvement of the extracellular matrix component, per se, disorders such as hypertension have been shown to be associated with altered expression of integrins. Arterial vessels from the spontaneously hypertensive rat exhibit age-dependent increases in αVβ3 and α5β1 integrins (181,185). As voltagegated Ca2+ channels appear to be regulated by activation of such integrins (see the section Interactions Between Ion Channels and Integrins), it is an attractive hypothesis that altered vascular reactivity and, hence, resistance, in hypertension may result from altered integrin expression. Further studies should be directed at understanding the functional consequences of pathological alterations in interactions among extracellular matrix proteins, integrins, and ion channels.
