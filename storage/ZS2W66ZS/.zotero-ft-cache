Summary

Cellular chaperone networks prevent potentially toxic protein aggregation and ensure proteome integrity. Here, we used Escherichia coli as a model to understand the organization of these networks, focusing on the cooperation of the DnaK system with the upstream chaperone Trigger factor (TF) and the downstream GroEL . Quantitative proteomics revealed that DnaK interacts with at least ∼700 mostly cytosolic proteins, including ∼180 relatively aggregation-prone proteins that utilize DnaK extensively during and after initial folding. Upon deletion of TF, DnaK interacts increasingly with ribosomal and other small, basic proteins, while its association with large multidomain proteins is reduced. DnaK also functions prominently in stabilizing proteins for subsequent folding by GroEL. These proteins accumulate on DnaK upon GroEL depletion and are then degraded, thus defining DnaK as a central organizer of the chaperone network. Combined loss of DnaK and TF causes proteostasis collapse with disruption of GroEL function, defective ribosomal biogenesis, and extensive aggregation of large proteins.

Introduction

In all cell types, molecular chaperones function in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, typically by shielding hydrophobic surfaces exposed by proteins in their non-native states. Chaperones have essential roles in assisting the folding, assembly and transport of newly synthesized polypeptides and in surveying the conformational status of preexistent proteins ( Hartl and Hayer-Hartl, 2009 ). Although detailed insights into the structure and mechanism of individual chaperone components have been obtained in recent years, how multiple chaperone modules cooperate to maintain conformational proteome integrity (proteostasis) is not yet understood ( Balch et al., 2008 ). What is the degree of functional overlap and specificity among chaperones, and how robust is the network in tolerating disturbances and avoiding collapse? Although there is evidence that the complexity of proteostasis networks has increased during evolution ( Gidalevitz et al., 2011 ), central players, such as the ATP-regulated Hsp70 chaperones, have been highly conserved from bacteria to human. Here we employed quantitative proteomics to analyze the chaperone network of Escherichia coli as a tractable model, focusing on the central role of the Hsp70 system.

DnaK, the major bacterial Hsp70, is one of the most abundant constitutively expressed and stress inducible chaperones in the E. coli cytosol. Yet it is not essential under nonstress conditions at intermediate temperature ( Bukau and Walker, 1989 ). Indeed, DnaK (together with its co-chaperone DnaJ and regulator GrpE) cooperates in de novo protein folding with the ribosome-bound chaperone Trigger factor (TF). Although DnaK and TF can be deleted individually, their simultaneous deletion results in synthetic lethality at temperatures above 30°C ( Deuerling et al., 1999 , Genevaux et al., 2004 , Teter et al., 1999 ). Under stress conditions, such as heat shock at 42°C, DnaK becomes indispensable ( Bukau and Walker, 1989 ). TF and DnaK act upstream of the essential GroEL/ES chaperonin , which provides a cage-like compartment for the folding of single protein molecules, unimpaired by aggregation. About 10% of cytosolic proteins (∼250 different proteins) have been found to interact with GroEL , of which a subset of ∼50−85 proteins (so-called class III substrates) are absolutely GroEL/ES dependent for folding ( Fujiwara et al., 2010 , Kerner et al., 2005 ).

The ATP-dependent reaction cycle of DnaK is regulated by the Hsp40 co-chaperone DnaJ and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE (reviewed in Hartl et al., 2011 , Mayer, 2010 ). DnaJ functions in presenting non-native substrate proteins to DnaK ( Figure 1 A ). Substrate binding and release by Hsp70 is achieved through the allosteric coupling of a N-terminal ATPase domain with a C-terminal peptide-binding domain, the latter consisting of a β sandwich subdomain and an α-helical lid segment. The β sandwich recognizes extended, ∼7 residue segments enriched with hydrophobic amino acids, preferentially when they are framed by positively charged residues ( Rüdiger et al., 1997 , Zhu et al., 1996 ). The α-helical lid and a conformational change in the β sandwich domain regulate the affinity state for peptide through an ATP-dependent, allosteric mechanism ( Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2011 ). In the ATP-bound state, the lid adopts an open conformation, resulting in high on- and off-rates for peptide ( Figure 1 A). Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is accelerated by DnaJ, leading to lid closure and stable peptide binding. Following ATP-hydrolysis, DnaJ dissociates and GrpE binds to the DnaK ATPase domain, catalyzing ADP release. Binding of ATP then results in lid-opening and substrate release for folding or transfer to other chaperones ( Figure 1 A).

Figure 1 . Isolation of DnaK-Interactor Complexes

(A) Schematic representation of the DnaK reaction cycle. Upon DnaJ-mediated delivery of non-native protein substrate to ATP-bound DnaK, hydrolysis of ATP to ADP results in closing of the α-helical lid (yellow) and tight binding of substrate by DnaK. Stable DnaK-substrate complexes are accumulated by depleting ATP with apyrase upon cell lysis .

(B) In vivo functionality of the chromosomally encoded DnaK-His6. The dnaK gene (WT) was replaced with dnaK-His6 (K His ) in MC4100 and where indicated in the isogenic chaperone mutant strains Δ dnaKdnaJ (ΔKJ), Δ tig (ΔT), Δ tig/dnaK-His6 (ΔT/K His ), Δ dnaKdnaJ Δ tig (ΔKJT), Δ secB (ΔB), Δ secB / dnaK-His6 (ΔB/K His ), Δ secB Δ tig (ΔBT), and Δ secB Δ tig/dnaK-His6 (ΔBT/K His ) as described in Extended Experimental Procedures . Cells in mid-log phase were serially diluted, spotted on LB agar plates and incubated for 1 day at 30°C, 37°C, or 42°C and for 5 days at 16°C.

(C) Schematic of the SILAC approach used to identify DnaK interactors . L (light) and M (medium) Arg, Lys isotope media. DnaK-substrate complexes isolated from M-labeled cells containing the DnaK-His6 (pulldown, PD) were mixed 1:1 with L-labeled proteins isolated with the same procedure from an equal amount of cell lysate containing non-tagged DnaK (background, BG). The mixture was subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis.

(D) Isolation of DnaK-substrate complexes. Soluble lysate, PD and BG fractions were analyzed by 4%−12% gradient SDS-PAGE, followed by Colloidal Blue or silver staining , as indicated.

(E) Cellular localization of DnaK interactors compared to the genome-based E. coli proteome ( Yu et al., 2011 ). ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001 based on χ 2 test.

Attempts to identify DnaK substrates have been limited to the analysis of proteins that aggregated in cells lacking TF upon depletion of DnaK ( Deuerling et al., 2003 ). Here we developed an approach for the direct isolation of DnaK-substrate complexes and their identification by quantitative proteomics from wild-type, TF-deleted, or GroEL-depleted cells. In parallel, we analyzed global proteome changes under conditions of single or combined chaperone deletion. Our measurements show that DnaK normally interacts with at least ∼700 newly synthesized and preexistent proteins, which we characterized based on their relative enrichment on DnaK. Individual deletion of TF or depletion of GroEL/ES leads to specific changes in the DnaK interactome and in global proteome composition. These effects are highly informative as to the functional cooperativity of chaperone modules. We conclude that DnaK is the central hub in the cytosolic E. coli chaperone network, interfacing extensively with the upstream TF and the downstream chaperonin. The functional interconnection of these major chaperone systems is critical for robust proteostasis control.
Results
Isolation and Identification of the DnaK Interactome

To isolate DnaK-substrate complexes, we generated an E. coli MC4100 strain in which the wild-type dnaK gene was replaced by dnaK-His6 , encoding DnaK with a C-terminal His6-tag (henceforth called K His ). K His cells grew like wild-type (WT) on agar plates or in liquid culture at 30°C−37°C, or under heat shock conditions at 42°C ( Figure 1 B and Figure S1 A available online). Quantitative proteomic analysis using SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) ( Ong et al., 2002 ) did not detect significant differences in protein abundance between WT and K His cells ( Figure S1 B). DnaK-His6 also supported normal growth of TF-deleted (ΔT) cells above 30°C and of cells lacking the protein export chaperone SecB (ΔB) ( Figure 1 B and Figure S1 A) ( Deuerling et al., 1999 , Genevaux et al., 2004 , Smock et al., 2010 , Teter et al., 1999 ). ΔB cells are cold-sensitive and this defect is compensated by deletion of TF ( Ullers et al., 2007 ).

(A) Growth of E. coli cells expressing WT or DnaK-His6 in different chaperone mutant backgrounds as indicated in the figure. Cells from overnight cultures were diluted in fresh M63 medium to an OD 600nm of 0.025 and grown at 30°C or 37°C.

(B) Whole proteome comparison of MC4100 cells expressing WT or DnaK-His6. The x axis shows the SILAC isotope ratios for 1021 quantified proteins in K His compared to WT cells of a representative experiment. The y axis shows log 10 collective peptide intensity of respective proteins.

(C) Comparison of the H/L isotope ratio distribution of a representative DnaK-His6 pulldown (PD) relative to background (BG) (red) and of a BG/BG control sample (green). The BG/BG control sample was obtained by mixing the proteins non-specifically binding to IMAC beads from H-labeled and L-labeled MC4100 cells expressing the non-tagged DnaK (WT ) . The vertical line corresponds to a H/L ratio = 2, the threshold chosen as minimal enrichment of PD versus BG to select for specific DnaK interactors . The false positive rate calculated from the BG/BG control experiment is < 0.2%.

(D) ATP-dependent release of interactors from DnaK. DnaK-interactor complexes were isolated from L-labeled ATP-depleted lysate and H-labeled lysate supplemented with 5 mM ATP, mixed and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. The H/L ratios of the 514 quantified interactors are shown. Ratios < 1 indicate a reduced interaction with DnaK in the presence of ATP.

(E) Molecular weight distribution of 1938 soluble lysate proteins and 672 DnaK interactors.

We isolated DnaK interactors by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) from K His cells growing exponentially at 37°C. DnaK-substrate complexes were stabilized during cell lysis by rapidly (within <10 s) depleting ATP with apyrase to inhibit substrate cycling ( Figure 1 A) ( Teter et al., 1999 ). The K His cells were SILAC-labeled with medium (M) Arg/Lys isotopes, lysate prepared and subjected to IMAC pulldown (PD). DnaK-His6 complexes were mixed 1:1 with a background (BG) sample obtained by the same IMAC procedure from lysate of unlabeled WT cells (light isotopes, L) ( Figure 1 C and Extended Experimental Procedures ). The composition of PD and BG samples prior to mixing is shown in Figure 1 D. Note that GrpE was co-isolated with DnaK as a stoichiometric complex ( Figures 1 A and 1D), whereas DnaJ was present in substoichiometric amounts ( Table S1 ). The molar ratio of DnaK/GrpE/DnaJ was ∼30:20:1, as estimated from the number of peptides identified by MS using exponentially modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) scores ( Ishihama et al., 2005 ).

A total of 674 DnaK interactors ( Table S1 ) were identified by  LC-MS/MS with >95% confidence ( Figure S1 C and Extended Experimental Procedures ), including proteins either not identified in BG samples or having a >2-fold enrichment (M/L ratio) in PD over BG in at least two of three independent experiments (biological repeats). Most of these (503 proteins) were >4-fold enriched over BG ( Table S1 ). The identification of DnaK interactors approached saturation in consecutive experiments ( Extended Experimental Procedures ). For the vast majority of interactors (>95%), the amount of protein co-isolated with DnaK was strongly diminished upon incubation of cell lysate with ATP ( Figure S1 D), indicating that these proteins bind DnaK in an ATP-regulated manner. While GrpE was released, DnaJ was enriched on DnaK in the presence of ATP (data not shown) ( Figure 1 A). The DnaJ homolog cbpA and the two small heat shock proteins , IbpA and IbpB (Hsp20), were also identified in DnaK pulldowns in the presence of ATP, suggesting that these chaperones functionally cooperate with DnaK (data not shown).

Approximately 80% of the DnaK interactors are predicted to be cytosolic, ∼11% are inner membrane proteins, ∼3% outer membrane proteins, and ∼3% are located in the periplasm ( Figure 1 E and Table S1 ). Thus, the identified DnaK interactors comprise ∼25% of the cytosolic proteome . As a collective, they are similar to a set of 1,938 proteins identified in soluble cell lysates (list available at the Proteome Commons Tranche repository) in terms of molecular weight ( Figure S1 E) and other physico-chemical properties, such as isoelectric point , average hydrophobicity , and aggregation propensity (data not shown), indicating that DnaK has a broad substrate specificity .
Classification of DnaK Substrates by Enrichment on DnaK

We next analyzed each of the different DnaK interactors to determine what fraction of the total protein is DnaK-bound, assuming that this parameter correlates with chaperone dependence, as was observed for the substrates of GroEL ( Kerner et al., 2005 ). Unlabeled soluble cell lysate (L) was mixed at a defined proportion with DnaK complexes isolated from cells labeled with heavy Arg/Lys isotopes (H) and H/L ratios were determined by LC-MS/MS. H/L ratios were obtained for 666 DnaK interactors, reflecting their relative enrichment on DnaK. The relative enrichment factors (REF) displayed a broad, bimodal distribution ( Figure 2 A). By setting thresholds at the 20th and 70th percentiles of the distribution, we grouped 142 proteins as less-enriched, 183 proteins as enriched, and 341 proteins as medium enriched on DnaK ( Figure 2 A and Table S1 ). Interestingly, the enriched proteins are below average in cellular abundance but together make up ∼40% of all identified DnaK interactors by mass ( Figure 2 B and Table S1 ), as based on emPAI scores. For these proteins ∼5% of cellular content is bound to DnaK. In contrast, the less-enriched DnaK interactors are highly abundant proteins but amount to only ∼13% of all DnaK interactors by mass ( Figure 2 B and Table S1 ). On average, only 0.1% or less of their cellular content is DnaK-bound. The medium enriched interactors amount to ∼47% of all DnaK interactors by mass, with ∼1% of cellular content being bound.

Shown is the mean burial propensity for each class; error bars correspond to the SEM. P values based on Mann-Whitney test: ∗ p ≤ 0.05; ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01. (F) SCOP fold distribution. c.37, P loop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases ; a.4, DNA/RNA binding 3-helical bundle; c.1, TIM β/α barrel; d.58, Ferredoxin-like; c.2, NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold domains; c.23, Flavodoxin-like; c.55, Ribonuclease H-like motif; c.94, Periplasmic binding protein-like II; b.40, OB-fold. Statistical significance for categorical variables is based on a χ 2 test: ∗ p ≤ 0.05; ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001.

The DnaK-enriched proteins cover a wide range of cellular functions, prominently including DNA replication , recombination and repair (COG class L), and cell division and chromosome partitioning (COG class D) ( Figure S2 A and Table S1 ). The less-enriched DnaK interactors have a significant preference for proteins involved in translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis (COG class J) and include 24 ribosomal proteins . Essential proteins ( Gerdes et al., 2003 ) are more frequent among the less-enriched substrates ( Figure S2 B). The enriched interactors include some very large proteins >100 kDa ( Figure S2 C) and tend to have more predicted DnaK binding sites than the less enriched substrates (both absolute and when corrected for size) ( Figure S2 D) ( Van Durme et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, they are more frequently part of heterooligomeric complexes (when ribosomal proteins are considered separately) ( Figure 2 C).

Right panel: K His and ΔKJ cells growing in L medium were pulse-labeled for 2 min with M or H amino acid isotopes, respectively. The total cell lysates (see Extended Experimental Procedures ) were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and analyzed by LC-MS/MS . The median ratios of two independent experiments are shown in the figure, indicating differences in amino acid incorporation rate in the proteins of the ΔKJ versus K His cells. Proteins found to be decreased in the proteome of the ΔKJ are in black. Note that most of these proteins are synthesized with the same rate as in wild-type cells. (H) Solubility upon in vitro translation as in Figure 2 D for the DnaK interactors that are degraded or aggregate in ΔKJ cells at 30°C. Horizontal line indicates the median, whisker caps and circles indicate 10th/90th and 5th/95th percentiles, respectively. P values based on Mann-Whitney test: ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001.

To determine whether the proteins enriched on DnaK have a high propensity to aggregate, we took advantage of the study by Niwa et al. (2009) who analyzed the solubility of E. coli proteins upon in vitro translation in the absence of chaperones. Indeed, the DnaK-enriched proteins are more aggregation prone upon translation than average proteins of soluble cell lysate, whereas the less-enriched DnaK interactors are more soluble ( Figure 2 D). This is consistent with the finding that the enriched proteins frequently display pI values close to neutral pH ( Figure S2 E). Moreover, these proteins are predicted to bury amino acid residues less effectively from solvent than the less enriched DnaK interactors and average soluble proteins ( Figure 2 E) ( Tartaglia et al., 2010 ). This suggests that the enriched interactors populate dynamic intermediate states during folding and expose hydrophobic residues, although their average sequence hydrophobicity is not increased (data not shown). Similar properties were previously found for the obligate (class III) GroEL substrates ( Figure 2 E) ( Raineri et al., 2010 , Tartaglia et al., 2010 ). Interestingly, ∼18% (29 proteins) of the DnaK-enriched substrates with assigned fold (159 proteins) contain at least one domain with SCOP fold c.37 (P loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases), compared to only ∼8% of soluble lysate proteins and ∼3% of the less-enriched DnaK interactors ( Figure 2 F). The c.37 fold is characterized by a complex α/β topology and is highly represented in heterooligomeric proteins ( Figure S2 F). The less-enriched substrates have a preference for the SCOP folds c.2 (NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold) and b.40 (OB-fold) ( Figure 2 F), which are found in abundant metabolic enzymes and in ribosomal proteins, respectively.

In summary, the relative enrichment of proteins on DnaK correlates with their propensity to aggregate during folding. The ∼180 most enriched DnaK interactors amount to ∼40% of total mass of DnaK substrates. They are of relatively low cellular abundance, tend to contain more predicted DnaK binding sites than the less-enriched interactors, and frequently assemble with other proteins to heterooligomeric complexes.
Effects of DnaK Deletion at the Proteome Level

To analyze the global effects of deleting the DnaK chaperone system, we performed quantitative proteomics of Δ dnaKdnaJ (ΔKJ) cells (H-labeled) in comparison to K His cells (M-labeled). The cells were grown at 30°C where deletion of DnaK/DnaJ is well tolerated in liquid culture ( Figure 1 B and Figure S1 A). Out of ∼1,400 proteins quantified, 105 proteins were increased in abundance in ΔKJ cells ( Table S2 A). These proteins include 42 identified DnaK interactors, presumably reflecting a compensatory response. In addition, the major cytosolic chaperones and proteases (GroEL/ES, HtpG, IbpA, IbpB, ClpB, Hsp33, HslU, HslV, Lon) were upregulated 5- to >10-fold, consistent with a 4.5-fold increase in abundance of the central heat shock regulator rpoH (σ32), which is negatively controlled by DnaK and DnaJ ( Table S1 ) ( Gamer et al., 1992 , Straus et al., 1990 ). Indeed, the genes of 56 of the 105 upregulated proteins contain known or putative σ32 binding sites in their upstream regions ( Zhao et al., 2005 ) ( Table S2 A). Interestingly, 87 proteins were reproducibly reduced in abundance in ΔKJ cells by ∼40%−95% (median 60%; p < 0.05) ( Table S2 B). SILAC pulse-labeling demonstrated similar rates of synthesis in K His and ΔKJ cells ( Figure S2 G), indicating that the observed decrease in protein abundance was largely due to degradation. Notably, among the degraded proteins were 40 identified DnaK interactors (four essential proteins), including the periplasmic chaperones of acid-denatured proteins hdeA and hdeB, and several amino acid metabolic enzymes. The DnaK interactors that are degraded in ΔKJ cells are above average enriched on DnaK in DnaK-His6 cells ( Table S2 B) and exhibit relatively low solubility upon in vitro translation ( Figure S2 H) ( Niwa et al., 2009 ).

To determine whether proteins aggregate in cells lacking DnaK/DnaJ, we analyzed the insoluble and soluble fractions of ΔKJ cells compared to K His cells. In total, 474 proteins were significantly increased in the insoluble fraction of ΔKJ cells, including 201 identified DnaK interactors ( Table S3 ). However, only 65 proteins were substantially depleted from the soluble fraction by 5%−90% (median ∼9%; p < 0.05) due to aggregation. Among this group of proteins were 30 identified DnaK interactors (eight essential proteins), such as excision nuclease subunit A (uvrA) ( Table S3 ). The extent of aggregation correlated strongly with enrichment on DnaK ( Table S3 ).

These findings demonstrate that a subset of DnaK interactors are specifically dependent on the DnaK system in vivo. These proteins tend to be degraded or aggregate in ΔKJ cells, even at a growth temperature of 30°C, where the loss of DnaK is otherwise well compensated.
DnaK Interacts with Newly Synthesized and Preexistent Proteins

To determine whether proteins interact with DnaK only during initial folding or return to DnaK later for conformational maintenance (newly synthesized and preexistent interactors, respectively), we performed pulse-SILAC experiments. K His cells grown at 37°C with unlabeled Arg/Lys (L) were shifted to M-labeled Arg/Lys for 2.5 min to label newly synthesized polypeptides . WT cells grown in heavy (H) Arg/Lys served as background control. Lysates from the K His and WT cells were mixed 1:1 and DnaK interactors identified. The M/L ratio of a DnaK interactor relative to its M/L ratio in the lysate (the latter correcting for rates of synthesis and turnover) was used to indicate whether it bound to DnaK preferentially as a newly synthesized or preexistent protein ( Figure 3 A). Isotope ratios were obtained for ∼300 DnaK interactors ( Table S4 ). Log 10 M/L ratios lower than 0, indicating a strong preference for interaction as preexistent protein, were observed for only 20 interactors ( Figure 3 A, green). Most other proteins bound to DnaK upon synthesis ( Figure 3 A, gray and blue), including ∼100 proteins with a strong preference for interaction as newly synthesized polypeptides (log 10 M/L ratio ≥ 1) ( Figure 3 A, blue). Ribosomal proteins are included in this group ( Figure 3 A, yellow), in support of the proposed role of DnaK in ribosome assembly ( Maki et al., 2002 , René and Alix, 2011 ).

We next compared the physico-chemical properties of the newly synthesized and preexistent DnaK interactors ( Figure 3 A). Ribosomal proteins were analyzed separately, as their unusual size and charge properties would introduce a strong bias. Interestingly, the 71 proteins with a strong preference to interact with DnaK upon synthesis are significantly shifted to large sizes and thus are likely to have complex folding pathways ( Figure 3 B). They are of average to above average cellular abundance and comparable to lysate proteins in terms of hydrophobicity and aggregation propensities, as calculated with the Z agg algorithm based on their amino acid sequence properties ( Tartaglia et al., 2008 ) ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Interestingly, only a few of these proteins aggregated in ΔKJ cells ( Table S3 ), suggesting that they can utilize multiple chaperones for folding or, perhaps less likely, have only low chaperone dependence. As expected, the ribosomal proteins have very low aggregation scores, consistent with their charge character ( Figure S3 B). Furthermore, the tendency to interact with DnaK upon synthesis correlates with a relatively lower enrichment on DnaK, suggesting that these proteins interact only transiently ( Figure 3 C). On the other hand, the preexistent interactors are similar in size to the average of lysate proteins ( Figure 3 B) and are more enriched on DnaK than the newly synthesized substrates ( Figure 3 C), arguing for longer residence times on DnaK. They are also characterized by higher intrinsic aggregation propensities than the newly synthesized interactors (p < 0.05) ( Figure S3 B) and several of these proteins were found to be degraded in ΔKJ cells ( Table S2 B). Thus, a prominent feature of the preexistent interactors is their intrinsic tendency to populate aggregation-prone states, consistent with a requirement for conformational maintenance by DnaK.

Protein Flux through DnaK

To measure the residence time of interactors on DnaK directly, K His cells were pulse-labeled with Arg/Lys isotopes (H) for 2.5 min, followed by a chase with excess unlabeled amino acids (L). Time course data based on the time-dependent decrease of the H/L ratio were collected for 91 proteins, with apparent dissociation rates from DnaK corresponding to half-times of ∼30 s to ∼25 min ( Figure 3 D and Table S5 ). Proteins with slow release rates (≤30th percentile of the rate distribution; 27 proteins) include GroEL, IbpA, and SecB, presumably reflecting the functional cooperation of these chaperones with DnaK. Slow releasing proteins (excluding chaperones) are characterized by above average enrichment on DnaK and an average number of predicted binding sites compared to all DnaK interactors ( Figure 3 E). Proteins with fast release rates (≥70th percentile of the rate distribution; 27 proteins) display average enrichment on DnaK and tend to have a lower number of binding sites ( Figure 3 E). Most of these substrates are predicted to bury hydrophobic regions effectively (data not shown). Thus, the residence time (and consequently the enrichment) on DnaK appears to be regulated, at least in part, by the frequency of potential DnaK recognition motifs in the polypeptide chain and by the efficiency of their burial during folding. Fast release rates correlate generally with the tendency of proteins to interact with DnaK only upon synthesis, whereas proteins that utilize DnaK also for maintenance have longer residence times.
Partial Functional Redundancy of DnaK and TF

To understand how DnaK interfaces with other modules of the chaperone network, we first investigated how the DnaK interactome changes upon deletion of the upstream chaperone TF. We identified the DnaK interactors in the TF deletion strain at 37°C by pulldown from H-labeled Δ tig / dnaK-His6 (ΔT/K His ) cells using L-labeled ΔT cells as the background. The number of identified DnaK interactors increased to 998 (see Proteome Commons Tranche repository), including ∼95% of the 672 DnaK interactors identified in K His cells ( Figure 4 A). (DnaK levels increased ∼1.4-fold in ΔT/K His cells; see Table S6 D below.) The additional proteins have physico-chemical properties similar to the DnaK interactors in WT cells (data not shown). To detect quantitative changes in the DnaK interactome upon TF deletion, we performed a comparative analysis of H-labeled ΔT/K His and M-labeled K His cells. Seventy-one proteins interacted to a significantly greater extent (1.4- to 3.3-fold) and 74 proteins to a lesser extent with DnaK in ΔT/K His cells ( Tables S6 A and S6B). The proteins accumulating on DnaK are typically small in size (<20 kDa) ( Figure 4 B) and include 17 highly basic ribosomal proteins as well as ten basic nonribosomal proteins (pI ≥ 9) ( Figure 4 C), such as several secretory proteins with functions in cell envelope and outer membrane biogenesis (Skp, AmpH, YcgK, SlyB) ( Table S6 A). The proteins that interacted less extensively with DnaK in ΔT/K His cells are larger in size ( Figure 4 B) and overlap with the large newly synthesized DnaK interactors described above ( Figure 3 B). Apparently, they bind to DnaK less efficiently in the absence of TF ( Figure 4 B).

(E) Outer membrane destabilization in ΔT/K His cells. Growth curves at 37°C of K His and ΔT/K His cells in the presence and absence of 0.1% deoxycholate or 50 μg/ml vancomycin . Arrow indicates the time of addition of deoxycholate or vancomycin after dilution of an overnight culture in fresh M63 medium at an OD 600nm of 0.025. Error bars represent SD of three independent measurements.

We also performed a proteomic analysis of total cell lysate of ΔT/K His cells as compared to K His cells. Only 40 of 1,490 quantified proteins were reproducibly reduced in abundance by 25%−85% (p < 0.05) when TF was deleted ( Table S6 C), although their rates of synthesis were unchanged ( Figure S4 ); 27 proteins were increased in abundance ( Figure 4 D and Table S6 D). Both these groups of proteins show minimal overlap with the proteins that accumulated on DnaK upon TF deletion ( Figure 4 D). Strikingly, most of the proteins that decreased in ΔT/K His cells carry predicted signal sequences ( Table S6 C). These proteins include numerous outer membrane β-barrel proteins, suggesting that TF has a specific role in outer membrane protein biogenesis. Indeed, ΔT/K His cells proved to be sensitive to treatment with detergents like deoxycholate and the antibiotic vancomycin , which is indicative of a weakening of the outer membrane ( Figure 4 E) ( Nichols et al., 2011 ). The proteins that increased in ΔT/K His cells include cytosolic chaperones and proteases, as well as the ATPase SecA required for membrane translocation of outer membrane proteins ( Table S6 D). However, these proteins are only moderately upregulated (∼1.5-fold), suggesting that loss of TF function at 37°C causes only limited proteome stress.

Right panel: K His and ΔT/K His cells growing in L medium were pulse-labeled for 2 min with M or H amino acid isotopes, respectively. The total cell lysates (see Extended Experimental Procedures ) were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and analyzed by LC-MS/MS . The median ratios of two independent experiments are shown in the figure, indicating differences in amino acid incorporation rate in the proteins of the ΔT/K His versus the K His cells. Proteins found to be decreased in the proteome of the ΔT/K His are in black. Note that most of these proteins are synthesized with the same rate as in wild-type cells.

These results indicate a functional redundancy of TF and DnaK in the folding/assembly of ribosomal and other small, basic proteins. In addition, TF has a specific role in the biogenesis of outer membrane β-barrel proteins. This function cannot be performed by DnaK and is only partially replaced by other chaperones, resulting in outer membrane destabilization.
Interplay of DnaK and GroEL/ES

GroEL and its cofactor GroES are upregulated in both the ΔKJ and ΔT/K His cells ( Tables S2 and S6 D), suggesting that these chaperone systems form a functional network. Strikingly, 119 of the identified DnaK interactors are known GroEL substrates ( Fujiwara et al., 2010 , Kerner et al., 2005 ), and together these proteins amount to ∼30% of all DnaK interactors by mass. The number of GroEL substrates on DnaK increases to 152 in ΔT/K His cells ( Figure 5 A, Table S1 , and Proteome Commons Tranche repository). Forty-two of these DnaK interactors are obligate GroEL-dependent (class III) and thus must be delivered to GroEL for folding, whereas 80 belong to class II and 30 to class I ( Figure 5 B). Class II substrates are highly chaperone dependent but can utilize either GroEL/ES or DnaK/DnaJ for folding in vitro, whereas class I proteins have a lower chaperone dependence ( Kerner et al., 2005 ). About 90 of the previously identified GroEL substrates were not detected on DnaK. Many of these proteins are of low abundance and thus may have very low steady-state levels on DnaK.

(A) Overlap of previously identified GroEL substrates (248 proteins) ( Kerner et al., 2005 ) with DnaK interactors in K His (672 proteins) and ΔT/K His (357 additional DnaK interactors).

(B) Class distribution of the GroEL substrates ( Kerner et al., 2005 ) compared to the class distribution of GroEL substrates bound to DnaK in K His cells, increased on DnaK upon GroEL-depletion and class distribution of GroEL substrates that are partially degraded in total cell lysate upon GroEL-depletion. Class I, chaperone independent; class II, chaperone dependent; class III, obligate GroEL substrates.

(C) Overlap of the GroEL substrates that are significantly decreased in the proteome of LS−/K His cells due to degradation and that increase on DnaK upon GroEL-depletion.

(D) Class distribution of GroEL substrates identified at 37°C in the aggregate fraction of LS−/K His cells and of GroEL substrates decreased in the total proteome of LS−/K His cells due to degradation.

To investigate how the depletion of GroEL/ES affects the spectrum of DnaK interactors, K His cells carrying the groELS operon under arabinose control were shifted from arabinose (LS+/K His ) to glucose for 3.5 hr (LS−/K His ) at 37°C, which resulted in ∼97% depletion of GroEL/ES ( Kerner et al., 2005 , McLennan and Masters, 1998 ). Note that the cells grow normally during the first 5 hr of GroEL/ES depletion (data not shown). Ninety-two proteins increased on DnaK (2- to 60-fold) upon GroEL depletion and 54 proteins decreased ( Tables S7 A and S7B). The former include 38 GroEL substrates (19 class III proteins) ( Figure 5 B). They are enriched in domains with SCOP fold c.1 (TIM-barrel) ( Figure S5 A), which is prominently represented among obligate GroEL substrates ( Fujiwara et al., 2010 , Kerner et al., 2005 ) ( Table S7 A). The proteins depleted from DnaK include 11 GroEL substrates, mostly of class II ( Table S7 B), suggesting that they are partially displaced from DnaK by class III substrates that are unable to fold.

Left panel: isotope ratios of proteins identified in the total cell lysate of LS−/K His cells relative to K His cells, grown under the same conditions at 37°C, plotted against protein intensity; black dots show the proteins significantly decreased (p < 0.05) upon GroEL depletion. Right panel: K His and LS−/K His cells growing in L medium were pulse-labeled for 2 min with M or H amino acid isotopes, respectively. The total cell lysates (see Extended Experimental Procedures ) were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and analyzed by LC-MS/MS . The median ratios of two independent experiments are shown in the figure, indicating differences in amino acid incorporation rate in the proteins of the LS -/K His versus the K His cells. Proteins found to be decreased in the proteome upon GroEL/ES depletion are in black. Note that most of these proteins are synthesized with the same rate as in K His cells.

We also analyzed the consequences of GroEL depletion at the proteome level. Depletion of GroEL resulted in a ∼35%−95% decrease in abundance of 114 proteins and a ≥2-fold increase of 95 proteins ( Tables S7 C and S7D). The former include 44 GroEL substrates (24 class III proteins) ( Figure 5 B and Table S7 C) that are apparently degraded ( Figure S5 B). Strikingly, 18 of these GroEL substrates nevertheless accumulated on DnaK ( Figure 5 C), suggesting that they are stabilized by DnaK for transfer to the degradation machinery. The proteins that are upregulated upon GroEL depletion include chaperones and proteases (upregulated ∼2-fold) as well as 19 GroEL substrates ( Table S7 C). In addition to degradation, loss of GroEL function at 37°C also resulted in substantial aggregation of many obligate GroEL substrates ( Figure 5 D) ( Chapman et al., 2006 , Kerner et al., 2005 ).

In summary, GroEL substrates interact extensively with DnaK. Upon depletion of GroEL, obligate GroEL substrates accumulate further on DnaK and are either transferred to the degradation machinery or eventually aggregate.
Proteostasis Collapse upon Combined Deletion of DnaK and TF

Prevention of protein aggregation is considered fundamental to  proteostasis maintenance ( Hartl et al., 2011 ). To define the relative contribution of the different chaperone systems to aggregation prevention, we performed a comparative analysis of the aggregated proteomes upon individual and combined chaperone deletion at 30°C, where cells lacking DnaK/DnaJ and TF (ΔKJT) still grow, albeit slowly ( Figure 1 B and Figure S1 A). As described above, 474 proteins increased significantly in the insoluble fraction of ΔKJ cells, compared to only 15 proteins in ΔT/K His cells and 33 proteins in GroEL/ES depleted (LS−/K His ) cells ( Figure 6 A and Table S8 ), indicating a major role of the DnaK system in aggregation prevention. Upon combined deletion of DnaK/DnaJ and TF, 1,087 proteins aggregated, including 403 DnaK interactors identified in this study ( Figure 6 A and Table S8 ). The aggregated proteins also included 149 of a total of 196 proteins shown previously to aggregate in cells lacking DnaK/DnaJ and TF ( Deuerling et al., 2003 , Martinez-Hackert and Hendrickson, 2009 ). Moreover, whereas in ΔKJ cells only 65 proteins aggregated substantially (>5% depletion from the soluble fraction), the number of substantially aggregated proteins increased 4-fold upon additional loss of TF ( Figure 6 A and Table S8 ). Strikingly, the size distribution of these proteins showed a strong shift to large proteins >50 KDa, frequently containing multiple domains ( Figure 6 B and Table S8 ). Many of these proteins (∼50%) are identified DnaK substrates of average or above average abundance ( Table S1 ) and represent a subset of the large proteins that interact with DnaK on synthesis ( Figure 3 B). Apparently, these proteins are chaperone-dependent but can utilize either the DnaK system or TF for efficient folding.

Figure 6 . Proteostasis Collapse in Δ dnaKdnaJ /Δ tig Cells

(A) Protein aggregation in ΔKJ, ΔT/K His , LS−/K His , and ΔKJT cells. The number of aggregated proteins were analyzed according to the following categories: total, aggregated to >5% (Total > 5%), essential proteins aggregated to >5% (Essential > 5%), DnaK interactors , DnaK interactors aggregated to >5% and GroEL substrates.

(B) Size distribution of >5% aggregated proteins in ΔKJ and ΔKJT cells in comparison to soluble lysate proteins of WT cells.

(C) Changes in abundance of small and large ribosomal proteins in ΔKJ, ΔT/K His , and ΔKJT relative to K His cells. SILAC ratios (mutant/K His ) are shown with standard deviations from three independent experiments for 21 small and 31 large ribosomal proteins.

Remarkably, ∼70% of the previously identified GroEL substrates (167 proteins) ( Kerner et al., 2005 ) were also recovered in the aggregate fraction of ΔKJT cells ( Figure 6 A), many of which aggregated substantially ( Table S8 ). This effect was observed despite a ∼10-fold upregulation of GroEL/ES (data not shown). Aggregation of GroEL substrates was essentially undetectable in ΔKJ or ΔT/K His cells at 30°C ( Table S8 ). Thus, substrate delivery to GroEL critically depends on the upstream chaperones but can be performed by either DnaK or TF.

A large number of ribosomal proteins also accumulated in the insoluble fraction of ΔKJT cells, almost all of which were identified as DnaK interactors ( Table S8 ). Deletion of DnaK/DnaJ alone resulted in the aggregation of only three ribosomal proteins, whereas none of these proteins aggregated in the ΔT/K His cells. Although aggregation did not cause a significant depletion of ribosomal proteins from the soluble fraction, these results suggested that ΔKJT cells have a defect in ribosomal biogenesis. Indeed, numerous ribosomal proteins were reduced in abundance by 10%−30% in total lysates of ΔKJT cells compared to K His cells and the single chaperone deletions ( Figure 6 C). Interestingly, two small ribosomal proteins (RpsQ S17 and RpsT S20) were increased in abundance, an effect that was also detected in ΔKJ cells ( Figure 6 C).

In summary, the combined loss of DnaK/DnaJ and TF results in a pronounced proteostasis collapse characterized by the aggregation of large, multidomain proteins, disruption of proper protein flux through GroEL/ES and defective ribosomal biogenesis. These findings explain the strong growth defect of ΔKJT cells at 30°C and their inability to grow at higher temperatures.
Discussion
The DnaK Interactome

The DnaK interactome characterized here comprises at least ∼700 proteins in WT cells and ∼1,000 proteins in TF-deleted cells, demonstrating the pervasive role of the Hsp70 chaperone system in protein folding and proteostasis . While the vast majority of DnaK substrates (∼80%) are cytosolic, DnaK also interacts with a small subset of proteins of the inner membrane , periplasm and outer membrane . Under conditions of exponential cell growth at 37°C, proteins bind to DnaK preferentially upon synthesis and may return to DnaK during their life time for conformational maintenance.

The dependence of proteins on DnaK for folding or maintenance is partially buffered by TF and other chaperones, but is reflected by the relative enrichment of substrates on DnaK. By measuring for each protein the fraction of total that is chaperone-bound, we defined a set of ∼180 interactors that are highly enriched on DnaK and amount to about 40% of the total mass of DnaK substrates. DnaK-enriched proteins are generally of average or below average cellular abundance and of low solubility. Essential proteins are underrepresented among this group. DnaK dependence tends to correlate with the number of predicted DnaK binding sites in polypeptide sequences, and the propensity of proteins to populate structurally dynamic intermediates. Moreover, proteins that interact extensively with DnaK are often part of heterooligomeric complexes ( Figure 7 A).

(A) Properties of DnaK substrates correlating with their relative enrichment on DnaK (fraction of total cellular protein bound to DnaK).

(B) Functional redundancies and specificities in the chaperone network formed by TF, the DnaK system, and GroEL . Numbers denote numbers of proteins determined in this work and in the study by Kerner et al. (2005) . ∗ Note that ∼100 known GroEL substrates were either not or not reproducibly identified as DnaK interactors . These proteins are of low cellular abundance and thus may have very low steady-state levels on DnaK.

Our findings suggest that proteins of lower abundance are frequently prone to misfolding or aggregation and thus have high chaperone requirements (with dependence on a specific chaperone system), whereas the folding properties of abundant (and often essential) proteins have been optimized in evolution, resulting in a reduced (or less specific) chaperone requirement. This is consistent with the existence of a negative correlation between the calculated aggregation-propensity of proteins and their cellular abundance ( Tartaglia et al., 2010 , Tartaglia et al., 2007 ). Indeed, the less abundant, DnaK-enriched substrates are aggregation-prone upon translation in vitro ( Niwa et al., 2009 ) and are either degraded or aggregate in the absence of DnaK in vivo, reflecting their specific requirement for DnaK for folding and conformational maintenance. Interestingly, several DnaK-enriched substrates contain at least one domain with SCOP fold c.37 ( Figure 7 A). Proteins with this and other complex α/β topologies have to form many long-range interactions during folding and are thus likely to populate dynamic folding intermediates exposing hydrophobic residues ( Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2004 ). Moreover, proteins with c.37 domains often assemble into heterooligomeric complexes ( Figure S2 G), a process that may be facilitated by DnaK's ability to bind partially structured protein regions in addition to extended peptide segments ( Schlecht et al., 2011 ). On the other hand, many large proteins of higher cellular abundance but lower enrichment on DnaK are adapted to utilize either DnaK or TF for de novo folding. These proteins aggregate substantially only in the absence of both chaperones, defining sequence length, and hence multidomain topology, as a property strongly correlated with chaperone dependence.

Proteins with essential functions are underrepresented among the DnaK-enriched substrates. However, our identification of the essential tubulin homolog, FtsZ , and the cooperating MinCDE proteins as strong DnaK binders ( Table S1 ) would explain why DnaK mutant cells have defects in cell division ( Bukau and Walker, 1989 ). Furthermore, the sensitivity of Δ dnaK cells to antibiotics causing DNA damage ( Nichols et al., 2011 ) is consistent with the finding that proteins of COG class L (DNA replication, recombination and repair), such as the nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA, are overrepresented among the DnaK-enriched substrates ( Figure S2 ). UvrA is a large, heterooligomeric protein with two c.37 domains; which aggregates to 30% of total in the absence of DnaK/DnaJ already at 30°C. The sensitivity of Δ dnaK cells to antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis ( Nichols et al., 2011 ) would correlate with the extensive interaction of DnaK with ribosomal proteins and the degradation in ΔKJ cells of several DnaK interactors of COG class E (amino acid transport and metabolism). Finally, the sensitivity of Δ dnaK cells to acidic conditions ( Nichols et al., 2011 ) is consistent with the 80%−97% degradation in ΔKJ cells of the periplasmic chaperones of acid-denatured proteins, hdeA, and hdeB.
Interplay between Chaperone Modules

Our analysis of the DnaK interactome in cells lacking TF or depleted of GroEL/ES underscores the significance of DnaK as a central hub in the chaperone network. The observed accumulation of a subset of proteins on DnaK in the absence of TF defines in a quantitative manner the functional redundancy between these two chaperone systems described earlier ( Deuerling et al., 1999 , Teter et al., 1999 ). Interestingly, these substrates comprise mostly ribosomal and other small (<20 kDa), positively charged proteins ( Figure 7 B), which may normally interact predominantly with TF, but shift to DnaK when TF is absent. Indeed, TF has a negative net charge ( Ferbitz et al., 2004 , Martinez-Hackert and Hendrickson, 2009 ), which may facilitate its interaction with positively charged nascent polypeptides, and a role of TF in the folding/assembly of ribosomal proteins has been suggested ( Martinez-Hackert and Hendrickson, 2009 ).

In contrast, the DnaK system is unable to replace the role of TF in the biogenesis of a set of secretory proteins , prominently including β-barrel proteins of the outer membrane ( Figure 7 B). These proteins undergo partial degradation in cells lacking TF, suggesting a specific role of TF in translocation of outer membrane preproteins across the inner membrane. Such a function of TF would be consistent with the initial identification of TF as a chaperone of proOmpA translocation in vitro ( Crooke et al., 1988 ) and with the finding that TF modulates the kinetics of protein export ( Lee and Bernstein, 2002 , Ullers et al., 2007 ). It is also of interest in this context that TF structurally resembles the periplasmic chaperone for outer membrane proteins, SurA ( Bitto and McKay, 2002 , Ferbitz et al., 2004 ).

An effective functional cooperation apparently exists between TF and the DnaK system in the folding of a group of large multidomain proteins that aggregate substantially only in the absence of both chaperones. These proteins may normally interact sequentially with TF and DnaK during translation or with multiple TF molecules in the absence of DnaK, as shown with large model proteins in vitro ( Agashe et al., 2004 , Kaiser et al., 2006 ). Notably, most of these proteins would be unable to interact productively with GroEL , as the capacity of the GroEL/ES folding compartment is limited to proteins up to ∼60 kDa ( Kerner et al., 2005 ).

The DnaK interactome overlaps extensively with the set of previously identified GroEL substrates ( Figure 7 B), most of which are below 50 kDa in size ( Kerner et al., 2005 ). GroEL substrates amount to nearly 30% of the total mass of DnaK interactors, indicating that protein transfer between DnaK and GroEL is a central function of the chaperone network. We estimate that only a minor fraction of GroEL substrates (∼20%) are transferred directly from TF to GroEL, circumventing DnaK ( Figure 7 B). Notably, upon GroEL-depletion, obligate GroEL substrates accumulate further on DnaK, reflecting an important role of DnaK as a buffer in stabilizing these proteins until GroEL is available or in transferring them to the proteolytic system.
Defining Proteostasis Collapse

Upon growth at 30°C, the loss of individual chaperone modules—DnaK/DnaJ, TF or GroEL/ES—is remarkably well tolerated by E. coli cells in terms of preventing major protein aggregation. Instead, degradation is the strongly preferred fate of misfolded proteins under these conditions ( Tables S2 B, S6 C, and S7 C). However, proteostasis collapse characterized by extensive aggregation of relatively abundant proteins occurs when TF is deleted in addition to DnaK/DnaJ. Apparently, the chaperone capacity available for the folding and stabilization of large proteins in particular becomes severely limiting and, as a result, aggregation is favored relative to degradation. Furthermore, our data show that the loss of the upstream chaperones, TF and DnaK/DnaJ, disrupts the normal protein flux to GroEL, resulting in wide-spread aggregation of GroEL-substrates, despite a ∼10-fold upregulation of GroEL under these conditions. The failure of newly synthesized GroEL substrates to reach the abundantly expressed chaperonin signifies the systematic collapse of the chaperone network.

Isolation of DnaK-Interactor Complexes

SILAC labeling of cells was performed at 37°C in M63 medium supplemented with light (L), medium (M), or heavy (H) arginine and lysine isotopes (see Extended Experimental Procedures ). DnaK interactors were isolated from cells growing exponentially (OD 600nm ∼1). In pulse-SILAC experiments, L-labeled cells were shifted to M-medium for 2.5 min; in pulse chase-SILAC experiments, L-labeled cells were shifted to H-medium for 2 min and then chased by addition of a 100-fold excess of L arginine and lysine for 2, 4, and 8 min. Spheroplasts were prepared as described ( Ewalt et al., 1997 ) and lysed in hypo-osmotic buffer containing apyrase . Soluble cell lysate was prepared by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min). Talon beads (Invitrogen) were used to isolate the DnaK-His6 and its interactors. The eluates containing bound proteins obtained from equal amounts of L-, M-, or H-labeled cells were mixed (see Extended Experimental Procedures ). Samples were prepared for LC-MS/MS as described ( Figure 1 C) ( Ong and Mann, 2006 ). The spectra were interpreted using MaxQuant version 1.0.13.13 ( Cox and Mann, 2008 ) combined with Mascot version 2.2 (Matrix Science, www.matrixscience.com ).

MC4100 Δ dnaKdnaJ ::Kan R (ΔKJ) and Δ dnaKdnaJ ::Kan R Δ tig:: Cm R (ΔKJT) ( Genevaux et al., 2004 ), Δ tig (ΔT) and Δ secB ::Cm R Δ tig (ΔBT) ( Ullers et al., 2007 ) or MC4100 SC3 Kan R with groELS under arabinose promoter (LS+ or LS−)( Kerner et al., 2005 ) have been described previously.

Replacement of the chromosomal dnaK gene by the dnaK-His6- Kan R or dnaK-His6- Cm R alleles was performed using the method developed by Datsenko and Wanner (2000) , except that the Cm R (or Kan R ) gene was first inserted by sequential cloning of the dnaK-His6 , cat (or Kan R ) and dnaJ genes in a pUC18 vector. The PshAI/BsaAI digested dnaK-His6- Cm R - dnaJ or dnaK-His6- Kan R - dnaJ DNA fragments were then used as templates for recombination in MC4100 WT, ΔT and LS strains ( Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 ). To construct the Δ secB (ΔB) and Δ secB/dnaK-His6 -Cm R (ΔB/K His ) strains, the Δ secB ::Kan R mutant allele from strain JWK3584 (Keio collection) was first moved into both MC4100 or MC4100 dnaK-His6 -Cm R strains by P1-mediated transduction ( Miller, 1992 ) and the kanamycin resistance was subsequently removed using FLP recombinase as described ( Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 ). The Δ secB ::Cm R Δ tig/dnaK-His6 -Kan R strain (ΔBT/K His ) was obtained by bacteriophage P1-mediated transduction of the dnaK-His6 -Kan R allele into MC4100 Δ secB ::Cm R Δ tig .

All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and by Western blot analysis using appropriate antibodies.
SILAC Medium

M63 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 0.5 mM L-amino acids, 1 mM MgSO 4 , was used for SILAC labeling, unless otherwise stated. To prepare L, M, and H media, the respective amino acids were added, for L: Arg0 and Lys0 (arginine and lysine, Sigma), for M: Arg6 and Lys4 (arginine- 13 C 6 and lysine-4,4,5,5-d 4 , Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), for H: Arg10 and Lys8 (arginine- 13 C 6 , 15 N 4 and lysine- 13 C 6 , 15 N 2 , Cambridge Isotope Laboratories).
Isolation of DnaK-Interactor Complexes

E. coli cells in exponential phase were grown at 37°C in 0.5 l SILAC medium to OD 600nm ∼1. Spheroplasts were prepared at 4°C as previously described ( Ewalt et al., 1997 ), resuspended in 3 ml SILAC medium supplemented with 0.25 M sucrose, 0.2% glycerol and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Lysis was rapidly induced by dilution of the spheroplasts into an equal volume of 25°C hypo-osmotic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 25 U/ml benzonase, 2x EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 100 U/ml apyrase (Sigma)) and was allowed to proceed for 1 min at RT. Apyrase treatment was effective in < 10 s. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C. The lysate was cleared at 20,000 x g for 30 min (an aliquot of the supernatant was saved for LC-MS/MS of the soluble proteome) and the supernatant incubated for 60 min with Talon resin (1 μl/mg total protein determined by Bradford assay) (Clontech) pre-equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl) for isolation by IMAC. The resin was washed sequentially with buffer A and buffer A/10 mM imidazole (200 column volumes each). DnaK-interactor complexes were eluted with 0.25 ml buffer A/100 mM imidazole. The eluted sample was then diluted 1:10 in buffer A and the isolation with Talon resin repeated. DnaK-interactor complexes were finally eluted from the beads with an equal volume of LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) by heating at 70°C for 10 min. Eluates obtained from equal amounts of differentially labeled cells were mixed at a 1:1 (v:v) ratio and separated on NuPAGE gradient gels (4−12%). Gels were fixed and stained with Colloidal Blue (Invitrogen). Preparation of gel slices, reduction, alkylation , and in-gel protein digestion was carried out as described ( Ong and Mann, 2006 ). Finally, peptides were desalted, filtered, and enriched on OMIX-C18 tips (Varian).
Fractionation of Total Cell Lysate

E. coli MC4100 dnaK-His6 (K His ) and different chaperone mutant strains (ΔT/K His , ΔKJ, ΔKJT, LS−/K His ) were grown at 30°C or 37°C, as indicated, in 50 ml of the respective SILAC medium to OD 600nm ∼1. After centrifugation cells were resuspended with 2 ml buffer B (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1x EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were thawed and sonicated (Sonicator 3000, Misonix) on ice for eight pulses of 15 s with 1 min interval. The lysate was cleared by low speed centrifugation (2000 x g, 10 min) to remove cell debris. The total lysates from L, M and H cells were adjusted to equal protein concentration and mixed at a 1:1:1 ratio. Aliquots were withdrawn for LC-MS/MS of the whole proteome. After centrifugation of the remaining total lysate at 20,000 x g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected as soluble fraction. The pellet was further processed for isolation of aggregated proteins as described ( Tomoyasu et al., 2001 ). In-solution trypsin digestion was carried out as described ( Olsen and Macek, 2009 ). The digested peptides were separated by PVC-SIL-NP column (YMC) on a MicroLC (Jasco) with a 102 min gradient from 98% to 68% acetonitrile. Each fraction was dried completely in a vacuum centrifuge concentrator at 35°C before LC-MS/MS.
GroEL/ES Depletion

The GroEL/ES depletion strains used (MC4100 SC3 Kan R and MC4100 SC3 Kan R dnaK-His6 Cm R ) have the chromosomal groELS promoter replaced with the araC gene and the pBAD promoter, and a kanamycin resistance ( Kan R ) cassette is immediately upstream of groELS ( Kerner et al., 2005 ). For GroEL-depletion (LS−), cultures grown in SILAC medium containing 0.05 g/l kanamycin and 0.2% arabinose were diluted 1:10 in fresh medium containing 0.2% arabinose. After growth for 2 hr at 30°C or 37°C, cells were washed with sugar free minimal medium and resuspended in pre-warmed SILAC medium containing 0.2% glucose to initiate depletion of GroEL/ES. Growing cells were diluted into fresh pre-warmed depletion medium every hour to an OD 600nm ∼0.3. After 3.5 hr, 0.5 l or 50 ml cells (OD 600nm ∼1) were collected for isolation of DnaK-interactor complexes or total proteome analysis, as described above. The level of GroEL was reduced by ∼97% compared to non-depleted cells.
LC-MS/MS

Peptides from in-gel digestion were eluted from OMIX tips using 50 μl of 80% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA. The samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge concentrator at 35°C and resuspended in 6 μl 0.1% formic acid (FA). Peptides from in-solution digestion of lysate fractions were directly suspended in 6 μl 0.1% FA. Using an Easy-nLC system (Proxeon) or nanoAcquity (Waters), 5 μl of sample were loaded at a speed of 0.5 μl/min in 0.1% FA onto a 15 cm long capillary column (75 μm inner diameter) with a pre-pulled capillary tip (New Objective) packed with Reprosil-Pur 3 μm or 2.4 μm C18 material (Dr. Maisch). Peptides were eluted at 0.3 μl/min using a 120 min gradient (pulldown eluate and pulse-chase samples), a 180 min gradient (pulse samples) or a 220 min gradient (lysate fractionation samples) from 2% to 80% acetonitrile, in 0.1% FA.

Peptides were directly injected into a Thermo LTQ-FT Ultra or LTQ-Obitrap using a nano-electrospray ion source (Proxeon) with electrospray voltages ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 kV. FT scans from m/z 330−1700 were taken at 100,000 resolution for LTQ-FT Ultra and 60,000 resolution for LTQ-Orbitrap, followed by collision induced dissociation (CID) scans in the LTQ of the 8 or 10 most intense ions with signal greater 2000 counts, and charge state larger than one. Dynamic exclusion of parent masses already fragmented was enabled. CID settings were as follows: isolation width 1, normalized collision energy 35 V, activation Q 0.250, and activation time 30 ms.

Determination of SILAC Ratios

MS data were analyzed with MaxQuant version 1.0.13.13 ( Cox and Mann, 2008 ) using the following parameters: Quant; SILAC Triplets, Medium Labels: Arg6, Lys4, Heavy Labels: Arg10, Lys8. Maximum labeled amino acids: 3. Variable modifications: Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-terminus). Fixed modifications: Carbamidomethyl (C). Database: Ecogene, released August 2009 with contaminants and a decoy database added by the SequenceReverser.exe program released with MaxQuant v. 1.0.12.4. Enzyme: Trypsin/P. MS/MS tolerance: 0.5 Da. Maximum missed cleavages: 2. Top MS/MS peaks/100 Da: 6. Mascot version 2.2 (Matrix Sciences, www.matrixsciences.com ) was used to generate search results for MaxQuant. Identify; Peptide FDR: 0.01. Protein FDR: 0.01. Maximum PEP: 1. Minimum unique peptides: 1. Minimum peptide length: 6. Minimum peptides: 1. Protein Quantitation based on Razor and Unique peptides. Minimum Ratio count: 2. ‘Re-quantify’ and ‘Keep low-scoring versions of identified peptides’ were both enabled. Normalized or non-normalized ratios were used as specified below for every experimental set-up. Supplemental tables show the leading protein for each protein group; that is, the protein which best matched all of the peptides identified.
Determination of the DnaK Interactome

Two sets of DnaK pulldown SILAC experiments were performed to identify DnaK interactors with and without TF deletion (i) and with and without GroEL-depletion (ii) with the following designs: (i) triple-SILAC, MC4100 WT (L) versus K His (M) versus ΔT/K His (H); double-SILAC, ΔT (L) versus ΔT/K His (H); (ii) triple-SILAC, MC4100 SC3 LS+ (L) versus LS+/K His (M) versus LS−/K His (3.5 hr growth on glucose) (H); double-SILAC, LS− (L) versus LS−/K His (H). 3 biological replicates were performed for each of the 2 set-ups.

DnaK interactors were determined from the triple-SILAC segment of experiment (i) by selecting the proteins enriched a minimum of 2-fold in the pulled-down over the background (non-normalized M/L ratio > 2) in at least two of the biological replicates. This resulted in a list of 674 proteins ( Table S1 ) with a false positive rate (FPR) lower than 0.2%. The FPR inherent to the pulldown mixing procedure was estimated by a SILAC control experiment where pulldowns from H- and L-labeled WT cells were compared. Only 1 protein out of 410 was identified with non-normalized H/L ratio higher than 1.4, corresponding to a FPR of 0.24% ( Figure S1 C). Note that the identification of DnaK interactors approached saturation, when considering consecutive pulldown experiments, the first resulting in 100% new identifications, the second in 30% and the third in 10% new identifications.
Determination of changes in the DnaK Interactome

Experimental set-up (i) and (ii) were used to determine changes in the DnaK interactome upon deletion of TF or depletion of GroEL/ES, respectively. To correct for changes in protein concentration that may occur due to the TF deletion or GroEL depletion, the normalized H/M ratios measured for the proteins in the pulldown were corrected for significant differences in protein abundance in the respective total lysates (Significance B calculated by MaxQuant < 0.05) before performing the statistical analysis. To this end, the H/M ratios of the mixed K His (or LS+/K His ) and ΔT/K His (or LS−/K His ) cell lysates were also measured and used to normalize the H/M ratios in the pulldowns. Significance thresholds for increased and decreased proteins in each pulldown were set at the median ± 1.5 MAD (median absolute deviation) of the distribution of the corrected, log transformed H/M ratios. Proteins were finally selected for the analysis only if found to be significantly changed in two of the biological replicates.
Enrichment of Interactors on DnaK

H-labeled DnaK-interactor complexes were mixed with appropriately diluted L-labeled soluble lysate. The measured H/L ratios, corrected for the dilution factor and normalized to the DnaK ratio (as determined by Western blotting), resulted in the relative enrichment factor (REF) of the interactors on DnaK with respect to their total cytosolic amount. DnaK-enriched and less-enriched interactor sets were formed by selecting proteins with REF > 5 and REF < 0.2, respectively, in at least 2 of 3 independent repeats of the experiment. These thresholds correspond to approximately 70 th and 20 th percentiles of the log 10 (median REF) distribution.
Determination of Proteome Differences Between E. coli Chaperone Mutants

K His , ΔT/K His , ΔKJ, ΔKJT and LS−/K His cells were grown at 30°C or 37°C, as indicated, in SILAC media as described above. M-labeled K His total cell lysate was divided into equal aliquots; one aliquot was mixed with L-labeled ΔT/K His and H-labeled ΔKJ lysate at a 1:1:1 ratio based on total protein concentration, while the second aliquot was mixed with H-labeled LS−/K His and L-labeled ΔKJT lysate. These samples were fractionated into soluble and aggregate fractions as described above. A reverse experiment was performed as a biological repeat by shuffling the labeling scheme.

At 37°C, L-labeled K His total lysate was mixed with either H-labeled ΔT/K His or M-labeled LS−/K His total lysate. In the reverse experiment H-labeled K His total lysate was mixed with either L-labeled ΔT/K His or L-labeled LS−/K His total lysate.

Proteins were selected for subsequent analysis when their levels were significantly changed in both biological replicates, according to MaxQuant Significance B (p < 0.05), for the total and soluble fractions. For the insoluble fractions, non-normal distributions of the mutant/K His SILAC ratios were observed due to extensive protein aggregation (especially in the ΔKJ and ΔKJT strains); therefore an arbitrary threshold of 2 was set in both biological replicates to select aggregating proteins for further analysis.
Pulse and Pulse-Chase SILAC

In the pulse-SILAC experiment, MC4100 cells expressing DnaK-His6 and MC4100 cells expressing DnaK-WT were grown at 37°C in 500 ml L and H media, respectively. During exponential phase (OD 600nm ∼1), K His L-labeled cells were collected, washed once with amino acid-free medium by centrifugation at RT, resuspended in pre-warmed M medium (0.25 mM Arg6 and Lys4, each) and incubated for 2.5 min at 37°C. H-labeled WT cells were processed in parallel but incubated for 2.5 min at 37°C in pre-warmed H medium. Cell growth was rapidly stopped by mixing with an equal volume of pre-chilled 2xPBS. Spheroplasts were prepared and lysed directly (i.e., without recovery phase at 37°C) as described above. The lysates obtained from the K His cells (L→M pulse-labeled) and WT cells (H→H pulse-labeled) were mixed 1:1 based on total protein concentration (aliquots were withdrawn for LC-MS/MS analysis) and subjected to IMAC isolation of DnaK interactors. Three biological replicates of the experiment were performed. Specific DnaK interactors were selected for further analysis with a minimal enrichment of 2-fold above the background ((M+L)/H ratio > 2) in at least two of the repeats.

The M/L ratios measured in the pulldown were corrected to take into account the small contribution of background proteins. Since the fraction of specific binding can be expressed as x = ( ( M + L ) / H ) − 1 ( M + L ) / H and since the background proteins will have the same isotope ratios as the lysate (M/L l ), the following correction factor was applied to the measured M/L (M/L m ) ratios in the pulldown: log ( M L ) = log ( M L m ) × ( 1 x ) − log ( M L l ) × 1 − x x

Non-normalized M/L ratios were used for each of these calculations. The median of the corrected M/L ratios from the three experiments was used for the final analysis. Deviation of log of the ratio ((M/L DnaK )/(M/L lysate ) from 0 indicates enrichment of newly synthesized or preexistent fraction of a protein on DnaK, respectively.

In the pulse-chase SILAC experiment, K His cells were grown in 1 l of L medium at 37°C. When OD 600nm approached 1, cells were collected, washed once with amino acid-free medium by centrifugation at RT, and resuspended in H medium (0.05 mM Arg and Lys, each). Pulse-labeling was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 2 min. The chase was started by addition of 100-fold excess of L Arg/Lys isotopes. Immediately after addition (time 0) and after 2, 4 and 8 min chase, aliquots of 250 ml were withdrawn and translation was stopped by mixing the cell culture with an equal volume of 2x cold PBS containing 2 mg/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma). All subsequent steps, from spheroplasts preparation to DnaK-interactor isolation, were performed at 4°C in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml chloramphenicol. Samples were processed for LC-MS/MS run was performed as above except that the reduction and alkylation steps were omitted. Consequently, in the Quant module of the MaxQuant software the Carbamidomethyl (C) was set as a variable modification. The non-normalized H/L ratios measured by MS were directly used for data analysis. Identified proteins selected for further analysis fulfilled the following criteria: (i) have H/L ratio measured for at least 3 time points including time point 0; (ii) the H/L ratio at time point 0 (H/L 0min ) is the highest; (iii) i and ii are satisfied in at least two of the four experiment repetitions. The H/L ratios measured at different time points for each protein were normalized so that H/L 0min  = 1 and the resulting kinetics were fitted to single exponential equation of the form y = A × exp ( − k t ) to estimate the apparent rate constant k for the dissociation of the DnaK-interactor complex.
Bioinformatic Analysis

Protein fold assignment was performed using SUPERFAMILY ( http://supfam.cs.bris.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY/ ) according to SCOP 1.73 classification ( http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/ ). Functional assignment of E. coli proteins was derived from the COG database (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) ( Tatusov et al., 1997 ) ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/ ). Signal peptide sequences, transmembrane helices and subcellular location of each protein were predicted with TargetP 1.1 ( Emanuelsson et al., 2007 ), TMHMM 2.0 ( Krogh et al., 2001 ) ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/ ), and pSORT 3.0 ( Yu et al., 2011 ), respectively. Calculation of the exponentially modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) to estimate protein abundance based on the number of peptides identified by MS/MS was performed using Mascot version 2.2 ( Ishihama et al., 2005 ). Theoretical isoelectric points (pI) and the average Hydropathy (GRAVY) of protein sequences were determined as described ( Bjellqvist et al., 1993 , Kyte and Doolittle, 1982 ). Intrinsic aggregation propensity was calculated with the Z agg algorithm ( Tartaglia et al., 2008 ). To estimate the propensity of proteins to bury amino acid residues during folding (protection from solvent), burial propensity scales were employed ( Janin, 1979 , Tartaglia et al., 2010 ). Lower burial correlates with the population of dynamic intermediates exposing hydrophobic residues. Based on the molar fraction of buried residues, Janin (1979) reported the following propensity scale, that we employed previously to predict substrate requirements for GroEL/ES ( Tartaglia et al., 2010 ): A, 0.9; C, 0.3; D, 0.2; E, 0.1; F, 0.4; G, 0.9; H, 0.1; I, 0.7; K, 0.0; L, 0.9; M, 0.1; N, 0.2; P, 0.2; Q, 0.1; R, 0.0; S, 0.6; T, 0.4; V, 1.0; W, 0.1; Y, 0.2 (amino acids in single letter code). Burial propensity profiles were calculated using a sliding window of 7 amino acids moved from the N- to the C terminus of the protein. Profiles were normalized employing the mean and standard deviation calculated over the lysate set of control proteins. The Mann–Whitney test was used to assess the discriminative power of the burial propensity with respect to the different groups. Statistical analysis was performed with the PROMPT software ( Schmidt and Frishman, 2006 ).
