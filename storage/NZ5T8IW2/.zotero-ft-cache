1 Deﬁnition of the diﬀerent energy-related magnitudes.
Here we explain the diﬀerence between the three energy-related magnitudes used in the manuscript: Ei, ∆Ei and ∆tEi. The subindex i indicates that these three deﬁnitions can be applied to the diﬀerent energy components that contribute to the adsorption process.
1. Ei corresponds to a given energy contribution. 2. ∆Ei describes the variation of a particular energy contribution (Ei) with the protein-
surface distance during the adsorption process. 3. ∆tEi represents the variation of that energy contribution (Ei) during the time of ad-
sorption.

2.2 SIMULATION METHODS
Figure S1: Evolution of the system density during the preliminary NPT simulation used for equilibrate the volume of the system using two diﬀerent barostats. During this preliminary stage, we heat up the system from 0 to 300 K while restraining the position of the protein backbone and the ﬁrst graphene layer. Here we compare the results obtained with two diﬀerent barostats: Berendsen1 (the one used in our adsorption protocol, green line) and Monte Carlo2 (orange). The time evolution of the system density does depend on the barostat used, but the converged density value obtained at the end of the simulation(ρ) is roughly the same with the two barostats: ρBer = 1.1084 g/cm3 and ρMC = 1.1161 g/cm3. This small diﬀerence between the two ﬁnal value (less than 1%) conﬁrms that, in spite of its known limitations,3 the Berendsen barostat is suitable for this task.

Figure S2: Analysis of the possible structural changes that could be induced during the SMD simulation for restraining the Cα belonging to 16 cysteine residues. To prove that restraining the Cα belonging to 16 cysteine residues does not aﬀect the structure of the protein, we perform the same SMD simulation as in our adsorption protocol but starting from a larger protein-surface distance (diPn−i S = 30 ˚A). In this way, the protein does not interact with the substrate during the whole SMD process and the only possible cause for a structural protein distortion is the restraining of those 16 Cα carbons. We have used the OBC method,4 as this is the implicit solvent method which distorts more the protein structure during the adsorption process (see Fig. 2 of the main manuscript). Both side (left) and top (right) views of the initial (top) and ﬁnal (bottom) conﬁgurations of this simulation are shown in a).The color representation used for the protein-substrate system is the same as in Fig. 1 of the main manuscript. For comparison, we also include in b) the ﬁnal conﬁguration obtained after the SMD process of our OBC implicit solvent adsorption simulation ,i.e. the one analyzed in the main manuscript (diPn−i S = 10 ˚A). In c), the time evolution of the β-sheet (top) and random-coils (bottom) content of the IgG during both SMD processes, i.e. starting at diPn−i S = 30 ˚A(continuous line) and at diPn−i S = 10 ˚A(dashed line) is also shown.These results clearly show that, when the protein does not interact with the substrate, the secondary and tertiary structure of the IgG barely changes during the SMD process, conﬁrming that the applied restrain is not aﬀecting the IgG structural stability.

Here we show the evolution of the inter-domain distances a) dF c−F ab1 and b) dF ab1−F ab2 using the three solvent methods here considered: Explicit5 (black), HCT implicit6 (blue) and OBC implicit4 (red). The experimental values of these two inter-domain distances, reported in ref. 8, are included in this ﬁgure with a green straight line. The explicit solvent results are the only ones consistent with the experiments.

Figure S8: Change of the total solvation energy, ESOL, of the protein+substrate system with the distance between them (dP−S). Here the results obtained using the a)HCT6 and b)OBC4 implicit solvent methods are showed. Its two energy components,
ESOL(nonel) y ESOL(el) are also showed. From this ﬁgure it can be observed that the OBC implicit solvent method predicts a larger increase of ESOL when the protein approaches to the surface than the HCT implicit solvent method.
