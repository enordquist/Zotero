Liquid state NMR relaxation spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the investigation of fast time scale dynamical processes in biomolecules.1-6 In the case of 15N- and 13C-labeled biomolecules, magnetic dipolar relaxation mediated by the directly attached proton(s) is dominant and the experimental relaxation data consisting of Tu T2, and NOE values are usually interpreted according to the model free formalism2 in terms of an internal motional correlation time and an order parameter S2. S2 is a general measure of the angular motion of the corresponding internuclear vector. To gain more insight, experimentally derived S2 values can be interpreted on the basis of analytical motional models or molecular force field based models.6 It is shown here
that 1 - S2 is directly proportional to the sum of the second moments of the spatial part of the dipolar interaction, revealing an analogy to crystallographic temperature factors. The relationship allows analytical treatment of the influence of Gaussian fluctuations about arbitrary axes on S2 order parameters. This type of motion is dominant in the case of harmonic and quasiharmonic dynamics of biomolecules.7-13
The S2 order parameter corresponds to the plateau value of the normalized correlation function of the lattice part of the dipolar spin interaction,2

1 - S2 is thus directly proportional to the sum of the second moments of the spherical harmonics of order 2 describing the orientation of the internuclear vector. It is evident that S2 is only sensitive to angular motion and remains unchanged under translational motion of the spin pair. S2 is equal to 1 and maximal in the absence of motion and decreases with increasing angular
mobility.2 Equation 5 illuminates the relationship between 1 -S2 and the
isotropic crystallographic temperature factor (B factor) in the absence of static disorder:16

An alternative representation of eq 1 can be derived on the basis of a fundamental relationship between the variance aj of a complex time-dependent stochastic function/and its correlation

where cr2( is the Cartesian fluctuation along direction £. r and Timtfi) are the distance and the first-order spherical harmonics of the orientation of the atomic position with respect to the equilibrium position. While 1 - S2 monitors the variances of the second-order spherical harmonics of atom pairs, the B factor reflects variances of distance-modulated spherical harmonics of first order of the positions of individual atoms.
The form of eq 5 suggests that the effects of certain analytical models describing the motion of the internuclear vector can also be expressed in terms of variances. Of particular interest is the case where the internuclear vector is modulated by Gaussian fluctuations about an arbitrary axis a. This type of dynamics occurs, for instance, in the practically important context of harmonic and quasi-harmonic dynamics of biomolecules.7-13 Without loss of generality, let a point along the z axis of a molecule fixed frame and let the orientation of the normalized internuclear
vector e be 12 = (8,<p) where 0 is the angle between a and e and
the equilibrium position of e is at <p = 0. The probability distribution p(<p) is assumed to be Gaussian with variance <j\,

The motional influence vanishes for e || a (0 = 0°, 180°) and is for small o2 largest when e _L a (9 = ±90°). For large <r2, all positions on the cone surface become equally probable and eq 10 reduces to the Woessner model (S2 = [/^(cos 0)]2), which yields S2 = 0 for 0 2 54.7°.20 For S2 > 0.75 it is sufficient to include in eq 10 only terms up to O(o2) resulting in the relationship

Local fluctuations of protein backbone <p and side-chain x torsion angles often significantly affect S2 values of adjacent N-H and C/3-H/S spin pairs, respectively. This dependence is shown in Figure 2 for the case of an N-H pair fluctuation about

In curve A, the cone semiangle 0 has been set to 118 0 as is the case for the backbone N-H vector fluctuating about the protein ^dihedral angle, and in curve B, 0 = 109° as is the case for a C0-H0 vector in an amino acid side chain

In the case of Gaussian quasi-harmonic long-range motion
about an effective three-dimensional axis a, such as hinge bending
motion,23 experimental NMR relaxation data enable the determination of the direction of a provided that tr* is sufficiently large to cause observable effects (typically if av> 10°). However, it is not possible to determine directly the absolute location of a in the molecule leaving two translational parameters undeter-
mined, since S2 monitors only orientational motion and not
absolute fluctuations. This is in contrast to crystallographic B factors (eq 6) which display a distance dependence which rises quadratically for large distances to a.
Finally we note that eq 10 also fits the thermodynamic interpretation of order parameters with the local partition function q given by q |sin 0|<x2 allowing estimates of motional contributions to the free energy difference SC between two different
protein states as discussed by Akke et al.24
