ABSTRACT: Cyclic peptides are a promising class of
molecules for unique applications. Unfortunately, cyclic peptide design is severely limited by the diﬃculty in predicting
the conformations they will adopt in solution. In this work, we
use explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations to design well-structured cyclic peptides by studying their sequence−
structure relationships. Critical to our approach is an enhanced
sampling method that exploits the essential transitional motions of cyclic peptides to eﬃciently sample their
conformational space. We simulated a range of cyclic
pentapeptides from all-glycine to a library of cyclo-(X1X2AAA) peptides to map their conformational space and determine cooperative eﬀects of neighboring residues. By combining the results from all cyclo-(X1X2AAA) peptides, we developed a scoring function to predict the structural preferences for X1−X2 residues within cyclic pentapeptides. Using this scoring function, we designed a cyclic pentapeptide, cyclo-(GNSRV), predicted to be well structured in aqueous solution. Subsequent circular
dichroism and NMR spectroscopy revealed that this cyclic pentapeptide is indeed well structured in water, with a nuclear Overhauser eﬀect and J-coupling values consistent with the predicted structure.

■ INTRODUCTION
Cyclic peptides (CPs) have promising applications in nanotechnology,1−3 as well as potential therapeutics, targeting a variety of protein−protein interactions (PPIs).4−12 PPIs play critical roles in important and disease-relevant biological processes.13,14 Modulating PPIs thus provides a means to
control diverse cellular functions for both fundamental research and disease intervention.15,16 Despite the promise of CPs for these applications, de novo design of well-structured CPs in aqueous solution remains challenging. CPs tend to form multiple conformations in solution,17−28 making them diﬃcult to design or even characterize. Furthermore, the limited availability of solution structural information makes it diﬃcult to develop sequence−structure relationships for CPs. Cur-
rently, there is no tractable experimental method to synthesize and characterize the structural ensembles of hundreds of CPs to determine which CPs are well structured, and ultimately to understand how CP sequences control structures.29−32
Although experimental determination of structural ensembles is diﬃcult, there have been many promising contributions from computational simulations.33−51 Recently, we developed a novel, highly eﬃcient enhanced sampling method customtailored to CPs by identifying their essential transitional motions (coupled two-dihedral angle movements).49 This enhanced sampling method has made it possible for us to quickly and eﬃciently sample a CP’s structural ensemble, with the inclusion of explicit water.49−51 This platform produces

more rapidly converged results, allowing us to simulate more systems than was previously possible. This advance has made it much more feasible to gather the broad simulation data needed to study sequence−structure relationships for CPs. In this work, we used this method to systematically simulate over 70 head-to-tail cyclized pentapeptides, uncovered their sequence− structure relationships, and ultimately designed a wellstructured CP.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS Model Peptides. The following model peptides were used in this study: cyclo-(GGGGG); cyclo-(X1AAAA), where X1 was any of the 20 standard amino acids; cyclo-(X1X2AAA), where X1/X2 was G, A, V, F, R, D, N, or S; cyclo-(GFSEV); cyclo(GNSRV); and cyclo-(GFNDV). Two diﬀerent initial structures of each CP, S1, and S2 (structure 1 and structure 2, respectively), were prepared using the Chimera molecular modeling package.52 To construct each CP, the linear peptide was ﬁrst built, followed by linkage of the N- and C-terminal residues and subsequent energy minimization.
Bias-Exchange Metadynamics (BE-META) Simulations. Following preparation in Chimera, each initial structure was solvated using a pre-equilibrated box of water molecules.

Figure 1. Cyclic pentapeptides typically form a β turn plus a tight γ/γ′ or αR/αL turn opposite the β turn. (A) Ideal dihedral angles, representative structures, and hydrogen bond patterns for the four types of β turns and four types of tight turns. (B) Populations and representative structures for the 16 turn combinations from our BE-META simulations of cyclo-(GGGGG). Types I, I′, II, and II′ β turns are shown in red, orange, green, and blue, respectively. Tight turns γ, γ′, αR, and αL are shown in cyan, magenta, purple, and brown, respectively. Populations and standard deviation were calculated from the ﬁve neutral replicas of the S1 simulations.

Minimal number of ions were added to neutralize the charge of
the whole system. Each structure was then energy-minimized
using the steepest descent algorithm, followed by a four-step
equilibration process. First, to allow the solvent molecules to equilibrate, a 50 ps isochoric−isothermal (NVT) simulation, followed by a 50 ps isobaric−isothermal (NPT) simulation, was
performed. In both simulations, a harmonic constraint was
placed on the peptide heavy atoms, with a force constant of 1000 kJ/mol nm2. Subsequently, a 100 ps NVT simulation,
followed by a 100 ps NPT simulation, was performed without
any restraints, to equilibrate the entire system. A thermostat of
300 K and a barostat of 1 bar were used for all equilibrations.
The NPT ensemble was used for all BE-META production
simulations. The temperature was maintained at 300 K using the V-rescale thermostat,53 with a time coupling constant of 0.1
ps. The CP and the solvent were coupled to two separate thermostats, to mitigate the “hot solvent−cold solute” problem.54,55 The pressure was maintained at 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat,56 with a time coupling constant of 2.0 ps and an isothermal compressibility of 4.5 × 10−5 bar−1. All bonds
involving hydrogen were constrained using the LINCS algorithm.57 Dynamics of the system were evolved using the leapfrog algorithm,58 with a time step of 2 fs. Both short-range
Lennard-Jones and electrostatic nonbonded interactions were truncated at 1.0 nm. Beyond the cutoﬀ distance, particle mesh Ewald59 was used for the electrostatic interactions, with a
Fourier spacing of 0.12 nm and an interpolation order of 4. A long-range dispersion correction60 for the energy and pressure

was used for the Lennard-Jones interaction beyond the cutoﬀ.
All trajectories were saved every 1 ps for subsequent analysis. All simulations were performed using the RSFF2 force ﬁeld61
with TIP3P water62 in Gromacs 4.6.763 with the PLUMED 2 plugin.64 The RSFF2 force ﬁeld was found to accurately recapitulate several CP crystal structures48 and therefore will be
used throughout this work. Conformational sampling of all CPs
was enhanced using BE-META simulations. The collective
variables in the BE-META simulations consist of two types of two-dimensional (2D) biases. The ﬁrst 2D bias is along ϕi × ψi, where ϕ/ψ are the backbone dihedral angles of the same residue. The second type of 2D bias is along ψ of one residue and ϕ of the next residue, ψi × ϕi+1. These 2D biases were previously found to enhance the conformational sampling of CPs eﬃciently.49 Both types of the 2D biases are performed on
each residue, giving a total of 10 biased replicas for a cyclic pentapeptide. Gaussian hills were deposited every 4 ps, with a
height of 0.1 kJ/mol and a width of 0.314 rad. Exchanges were attempted every 5 ps between diﬀerent replicas. For analysis of an unbiased structural ensemble, ﬁve neutral replicas were
added, giving a total of 15 replicas per CP. Principal Component and Cluster Analysis. To
characterize the structural ensemble of each CP, the last 50
ns of the unbiased replicas were analyzed using dihedral principal component analysis (dPCA) with the ϕ and ψ angles of all residues.65,66 However, if the peptide sequence is
homogeneous (i.e., cyclo-(AAAAA)), an additional step needs
to be performed prior to dPCA. To take degeneracy into
account, the previously developed root-mean-square deviation

(RMSD) scheme was applied.49 In brief, ﬁrst the ϕ/ψ dihedral
angles of the neutral replicas were calculated. For a cyclic pentapeptide with a homogeneous sequence, there are ﬁve ways
of reordering each frame. The RMSD to a reference structure was calculated for each of the ﬁve permutations, and the
structure with the lowest RMSD to the reference structure was
used to reorder the CP.
Following dPCA, the population of each cluster was calculated using a density peak-based cluster analysis.67 For cluster analysis, the principal subspace along the ﬁrst three
principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3) was divided into 50 × 50 × 50 grids. Only grids with a population greater than
0.1 were used in cluster analysis. The population of each cluster
was determined by summing the population of every grid the
cluster contained. dPCA and cluster analysis was used to
analyze the structural ensembles of cyclo-(X1AAAA), cyclo(X1X2AAA), cyclo-(GFSEV), cyclo-(GNSRV), and cyclo(GFDNV).
Simulation convergence was monitored using the normalized integrated product38 of the density proﬁles along PC1, PC2,
and PC3 of the S1 and S2 simulations. Convergence was achieved when the density proﬁles were similar. Final
simulation lengths ranged from 100 to 300 ns. All further
analysis was performed on the S1 simulations. Cutoﬀ Turn Analysis. Because of their highly constrained
nature, cyclic pentapeptides typically form structures containing a β turn plus a tight turn on the opposite side of the CP. The four commonly observed β turns and tight turns give a total of
16 turn combinations (Figure 1A). However, for cyclo-
(GGGGG), dPCA and cluster analysis did not identify all 16
turn combinations. To determine whether all turn combinations were present in cyclo-(GGGGG), turns were identiﬁed if the ϕ/ψ dihedral angles were within 35° of the ideal values for a speciﬁc type of turn (Figure 1A). Similarly, this cutoﬀ-based
turn type analysis was used to compare all 16 types of turn
combinations in the cyclo-(X1AAAA) and cyclo-(X1X2AAA) pentapeptides (Figures 3A and S1), as the dPCA−cluster
analysis was unable to pick up combinations with very low
populations. Logo Plot for Individual Amino Acids from Cyclo-
(X1AAAA) Simulations. To determine the most probable amino acid for each position of a given turn combination, we
weighted X1 in cyclo-(X1AAAA) using the following scheme. The preference of the amino acid X1, when X1 ≠ A, for each of the ﬁve locations within a given turn combination was determined by its population from the cutoﬀ turn analysis. In the case of cyclo-(AAAAA), there are ﬁve degenerate amino acids, and the population was divided by ﬁve for the associated
position in the logo plot. The logo plot for cyclo-(X1AAAA) for the βII′ + αR turn combination is shown in Figure 4A.
Neighbor Analysis for X1X2 from Cyclo-(X1X2AAA) Simulations. To help design well-structured cyclic peptides, a
scoring function based on neighboring residues was developed
using the simulation results of cyclo-(X1X2AAA), where X1/X2 is G, V, F, R, D, N, and S. To evaluate the preference score for a sequence cyclo-(X1X2X3X4X5) to adopt a speciﬁc β turn at X1X2 and a speciﬁc tight turn at X4, the sequence was broken down into ﬁve sets of nearest neighbor pairs, X1X2, X2X3, X3X4, X4X5, and X5X1, and the total preference score was the sum of the ﬁve populations for each pair to adopt the desired structure in the
simulations of cyclo-(X1X2AAA), cyclo-(X2X3AAA), etc. For example, the score for sequence cyclo-(X1X2X3X4X5) adopting a type II′ β turn at X1X,2 and an αR turn at X4 was calculated as

follows. We analyzed the structural ensemble of cyclo-

(X1X2AAA) using the cutoﬀ-based turn analysis to evaluate the population of cyclo-(X1X2AAA) that adopts a type II′ β turn at X1X2 and an αR turn at A4, the population of cyclo(AX2X3AA) that adopts a type II′ β turn at 1AX2 and an αR turn at A4, the population of cyclo-(AAX3X4A) that adopts a type II′ β turn at 1AA2 and an αR turn at X4, etc. The score was then calculated as the sum of these ﬁve populations, when each pair

is located at the desired location of the target turn combination

(example for cyclo-(GNSRV) shown in Figure 5A).

Thermodynamics Decomposition. To further under-

stand the structural ensemble of a CP, we performed

thermodynamics decomposition of the S1 simulation. ΔG

between clusters was calculated using the Boltzmann equation,

using the ratios of cluster populations and the most populated

cluster as a reference. ΔG was then further separated into ΔH

and ΔS, where ΔH was estimated from the diﬀerence in

potential energy between clusters. ΔH was then further decomposed into peptide in vacuum (ΔHPvac) and the rest (ΔHrest). To perform this decomposition, the potential energy
of two groups was calculated: peptide and solvent/ions (note

that ions may not be present in all systems). The peptide

enthalpy (ΔHPvac) consisted of peptide Lennard-Jones (ΔHPLJ),

short-range and 1,4 electrostatics (ΔHPEE(SR+1,4)), bonds

(ΔHPbond), angles (ΔHPangle), proper dihedrals (ΔHPdih.), and

improper dihedrals (ΔHPimp.). ΔS was further decomposed into

conﬁgurational entropy of the peptide (ΔSPconf) and solvation

entropy (ΔSw). ΔSPconf information spanning

was calculated using the tree68−70 method, and

maximum ΔSw was

calculated using ΔSw = ΔS − ΔSPconf.

Linear Peptide Synthesis. The linear peptides were

synthesized at 0.04 mmol scale on HMPB-ChemMatrix resin

(PCAS BioMatrix Inc., loading = 0.5 mmol/g). The linear

peptides were prepared with C-terminal glycine to facilitate

head-to-tail cyclization. The HMPB resin was ﬁrstly function-

alized with glycine: 5 mmol Fmoc-glycine-OH and 2.5 mmol

N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide were dissolved in 15 mL

dimethylformamide (DMF). After 10 min at room temperature,

the mixture was added to 0.75 g of HMPB resin in a 20 mL

Torviq fritted syringe. After another 1 min, 0.05 mmol 4-

dimethylaminopyridine was added and reacted at room

temperature for 16 h, followed by three times wash with

DMF, twice 5 min deprotection with 20% (v/v) piperidine in

DMF, and four times wash with DMF. The resin was washed

thoroughly with dichloromethane (DCM) and dried under

vacuum. The following solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)

was carried out on a synthesizer for automated ﬂow peptide synthesis.71 After completion of the SPPS, the resin was washed

thoroughly with DCM and dried under vacuum. The resins

were transferred to a 50 mL plastic tube and the peptide was

simultaneously cleaved from the resin and side-chain

deprotected by treatment with 2.5% (v/v) water, 2.5% (v/v)

1,2-ethanedithiol, and 1% (v/v) triisoproprylsilane in neat

triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) for 2 h at room temperature. The

resulting solution containing peptide was triturated and washed

with cold diethyl ether (prechilled in −80 °C freezer) two

times. The obtained gummylike solid was dissolved in 50%

H2O/50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA and lyophilized. Peptide Cyclization and Puriﬁcation. The lyophilized

Structural Ensembles of Cyclo-(GGGGG) and Cyclo-
(X1AAAA) Map Out the Available Conformational Space for Simple Cyclic Pentapeptides. Cyclic pentapeptides typically form a β turn plus a tight turn opposite the β turn.72−79 There are four types of β turns (βI, βII, βI′, and βII′) and four types of tight turns (γ, γ′, αR, and αL) that are commonly observed (Figure 1A), leading to 16 possible turn
combinations for cyclic pentapeptides. A cyclic pentapeptide

NMR Characterization. The peptide was dissolved in H2O/D2O (90:10) at a concentration of roughly 3.5 mM. Onedimensional (1D) and 2D 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a

helix (αR and αL, respectively) will form only one intrapeptide hydrogen bond (at the β turn site; Figure 1B, top row). All of these 16 turn combinations were seen in our bias-exchange

Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer with CryoProbe at 288 K.
Complete resonance assignments were made using homonuclear 1H−1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and
rotating-frame Overhauser spectroscopy (ROESY) experi-
ments. Standard pulse programs available from the Bruker
library were used, with mixing times of 60 ms for the TOCSY and 250 ms for the ROESY. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (δ 0.00 ppm) in water. 3JNH, CHα coupling constants were measured from 1D 1H NMR.
Circular Dichroism (CD) Characterization. Compounds were dissolved in water to concentrations of 87.5 μM, as
measured by peptide weight. Equal concentrations of the peptides were veriﬁed prior to CD analysis by subjecting
peptides to analytical HPLC and normalizing on the basis of

metadynamics (BE-META) simulations of cyclo-(GGGGG) and are shown in Figure 1B. The most populated conformation was a βII + αL, with a population of 14.7 ± 0.6%. We observed that the mirror-image turn combination, βII′ + αR, has a population (14.3 ± 0.4%) similar to that of βII + αL. Because glycine is achiral, theoretically, conformations that are mirror images of each other should have exactly the same population. In our simulations of cyclo-(GGGGG), each conformation and its mirror image indeed had similar populations (Figure 1B), further supporting convergence of our simulation results.
Among the 16 turn combinations observed in cyclo(GGGGG), all clusters with an αR/αL turn (top row of Figure 1B) were more populated than clusters with a γ/γ′ turn (bottom row of Figure 1B). To further understand this structural preference of cyclo-(GGGGG), we performed thermodynamics decomposition on the 16 clusters (Table

clusters. However, they both had an unfavorable peptide
enthalpy relative to the top clusters (most populated clusters; βII + αL and βII′ + αR), arising from unfavorable electrostatics, angles, and dihedrals. Clusters 5 and 6 formed the βII′ + αL and βII + αR turn combinations, respectively, and were less stable than the most populated clusters due to peptide electrostatics
and dihedrals. The least populated turn combinations involving αL and αR, βI′ + αR and βI + αL (clusters 7 and 8) had unfavorable peptide angles and dihedrals compared with the
most populated cluster. In contrast to clusters 1−8, clusters 9−16 formed a γ/γ′ turn
instead of adopting an αR/αL conformation. Because clusters with a γ/γ′ turn form two intrapeptide hydrogen bonds, their
peptide electrostatics were more favorable than those of the most populated cluster (Table S1). However, clusters with a γ/ γ′ turn all had unfavorable angles and dihedrals as well as
unfavorable solvation enthalpy, relative to the top cluster. A combination of these factors makes clusters with γ/γ′ turns have lower populations than their αR/αL counterparts.
Moving from achiral glycine to the simplest all L-amino acid
peptide, cyclo-(AAAAA), we expected turn combinations involving an αR turn to be preferred over an αL turn, on the basis of the ϕ angle preferences for an L-amino acid. The four
most populated clusters of cyclo-(AAAAA) from our BE-
META simulation are shown in Figure 2, and indeed all of these turn combinations had a tight αR turn rather than a tight αL turn, corresponding to clusters 2, 3, 6, and 7, respectively, in Figure 1B for cyclo-(GGGGG). Similar to cyclo-(GGGGG), βII′ + αR was the most favorable turn combination, with a population of 52.9 ± 0.7%. The second most populated cluster formed a distorted type βI + αR, where the distorted type I β turn had nearly ideal dihedral angles for a type I β turn, but deviation in the ψ angle of the i + 2 residue results in a turn that
does not frequently form a hydrogen bond.
Breaking down the thermodynamics of cyclo-(AAAAA), the distorted βI + αR cluster had less favorable electrostatics and dihedrals compared with the most populated βII′ + αR turn combination (Table S2). The third and fourth most populated clusters formed a βII + αR and a distorted type βI′ + αR, and compared with cyclo-(GGGGG), the preferred order of all of the αR-containing clusters remained the same. Both clusters 3 and 4 were less favorable than the most populated cluster due to entropy, speciﬁcally peptide conﬁgurational entropy.
Looking at the peptide contribution to the thermodynamics,
clusters 3 and 4 have poor electrostatics and cluster 4 (distorted βI′ + αR) also had unfavorable angles compared with the most populated βII′ + αR (Table S2).
Overall, for the thermodynamics of cyclo-(GGGGG), we
found that the most populated conformation and its mirror-
image counterpart are stabilized over the other clusters via
either peptide or solvation enthalpy. The most populated
conformation of cyclo-(AAAAA), on the other hand, is
entropically more favorable than the other clusters due to either conﬁgurational or solvation entropy. The complex
balance between peptide enthalpy, solvation enthalpy, and
entropy for these two simple cyclic pentapeptide systems reaﬃrms the necessity of using explicit water in CP simulations
to accurately describe each thermodynamic factor. Structural Ensembles of Cyclo-(X1AAAA) Show Struc-
tural Preferences of Each Amino Acid. To understand how diﬀerent amino acids aﬀect structural preferences of a cyclic
pentapeptide, we performed BE-META simulations of cyclo-
(X1AAAA), where X1 was any of the 20 basic amino acids. The

population and turn combination of the three most populated
clusters for each of these 20 sequences are given in Table S3. We found that the turn combination βII′ + αR was by far the most prevalent, accounting for ∼75% of all of the turn
combinations that form for these 20 CPs (Figure 3A). The second most populated turn combination was a distorted βI + αR (∼14%). Although βII′ + αR predominated among the turn combinations observed for these 20 CPs, the locations of the type II′ β turn and the αR residue varied within the X1AAAA sequence (Figure 3B and Table S3).
By combining the results from all 20 cyclo-(X1AAAA) CPs, we constructed a logo plot showing the probability of each amino acid for each location in the βII′ + αR turn combination (Figure 4A). We hypothesized that combining the most probable amino acid at every position of the βII′ + αRstructured cyclic pentapeptide would produce a sequence that
adopts a well-structured conformation. On the basis of the
results shown in Figure 4A, the sequence, cyclo-(GFSEV), was predicted to be the most structured for a βII′ + αR turn combination, with the βII′ turn located at 1GF2 and αR turn located at E4. To verify this prediction, this designed sequence
was simulated using BE-META simulations to characterize its structural ensemble. The most populated cluster (54.8 ± 0.6%) of cyclo-(GFSEV) was indeed the βII′ + αR turn combination, with the type II′ β turn at 1GF2 and a tight αR turn at E4 (Figure 4B). However, this population (∼55%) was not signiﬁcantly
higher than the most populated cluster of simple cyclo(AAAAA) (∼53%). This result suggests that the structural
preferences for each of the 20 amino acids within cyclo-
(X1AAAA) are not necessarily additive, implying that neighboring residues might aﬀect each other’s structural
preferences. This would explain why merely using results
from cyclo-(X1AAAA) studies did not enable design of a particularly well-structured cyclic pentapeptide.
Structural Ensembles of Cyclo-(X1X2AAA) Reveal Cooperative Eﬀects between Neighboring Amino Acids. To understand the eﬀects of neighboring amino acids
on the structural ensemble of a cyclic pentapeptide, we
performed BE-META simulations of cyclo-(X1X2AAA), where X1/X2 was G, A, V, F, R, D, N, or S. These eight amino acids were chosen as a representative subsection of the 20 basic
amino acids. The populations and turn combinations of the
three most populated clusters for each of these 56 sequences is
given in Table S4. Similar to cyclo-(X1AAAA), most of the top clusters formed a tight αR turn, which is consistent with the ϕ angle preferences for an L-amino acid. However, there were a few instances where a γ turn occurs in the top three clusters. Nonetheless, we observed that βII′ + αR remains the most prevalent in all 56 cyclo-(X1X2AAA) CPs, similar to cyclo(X1AAAA) (Figure S1 compared to Figure 3A). In fact, βII′ + αR was the most populated cluster for 49 out of the 56 sequences. However, turn locations varied in the top clusters forming βII′ + αR, depending on their sequences.
Rational Design of Well-Structured CPs. To help design
a well-structured cyclic pentapeptide, we used the structural
ensemble results of cyclo-(X1X2AAA) CPs to develop a scoring function based on the observed populations for the desired
conformation. The scoring function combined the structural
preferences of each neighboring pair (X1X2, X2X3, etc.) in a cyclic pentapeptide cyclo-(X1X2X3X4X5) for a speciﬁc conformation (see “Neighbor Analysis for X1X2 from Cyclo(X1X2AAA) Simulations” in Materials and Methods). Because alanine was a common ﬁller amino acid in the cyclo-

scores for the 20 highest-scoring cyclo-(X1X2X3X4X5) sequences for the βII′ + αR turn combination, with a type II′ β turn at X1X2 and an αR turn at X4, are given in Table S5. Of all 16 807 sequences, cyclo-(GNSRV) received the highest score (1.287) for the βII′ + αR turn combination (Figure 5A and highlighted in blue in Figure 5B). To verify this prediction, BE-META
simulations of cyclo-(GNSRV) were performed. The simulation
results revealed a well-structured conformational ensemble, with the most populated cluster forming a type II′ β turn at 1GN2 and a tight αR turn at R4, as predicted by the scoring
function, with a population of 67% (Figure 6A).
To further understand why cyclo-(GNSRV) is well-
structured, we performed thermodynamics decomposition on this peptide and on the ﬁve parent cyclo-(X1X2AAA) peptides that contain the ﬁve relevant neighbor pairs (Table S6).
Comparing the location of the turns in cyclo-(GNSRV) to the locations of the turns in the ﬁve parent sequences, cyclo-
(GNAAA), cyclo-(AAARV), and cyclo-(GAAAV) all had the βII′ + αR turns at the same location as cyclo-(GNSRV) in the most populated cluster. However, in cyclo-(ANSAA) and cyclo(AASRA), the βII′ + αR turn combination corresponding to cyclo-(GNSRV) occurred as the third and second most
populated clusters, respectively. The comparison of the

thermodynamics of cyclo-(GNSRV) and the ﬁve parent
sequences shows that a variety of factors stabilized the most
populated clusters and that these factors are generally consistent among the ﬁve neighbor-pair peptides and cyclo-
(GNSRV). For example, the most populated cluster of cyclo(GNSRV), cyclo-(AAARV), and cyclo-(GAAAV) formed a βII′ + αR, whereas the second most populated cluster formed a βII′ + γ with the γ turn at the same residues as the αR turn. In all three simulations, the top clusters were stabilized over the second clusters due to enthalpy. Speciﬁcally, even though the βII′ + γ clusters have more favorable intrapeptide electrostatics, they have more unfavorable dihedrals and much more
unfavorable solvation enthalpy as compared to those of the
most populated cluster. Interestingly, the most populated
conformation of cyclo-(GNSRV) is both enthalpically and
entropically stabilized over clusters 2 and 3. This is unlike any of the ﬁve parent sequences, whose most populated cluster is
stabilized by either enthalpy or entropy alone.
Previously, using the simulation results of cyclo-(X1AAAA), where X1 was any of the 20 basic amino acids, cyclo-(GFSEV) was predicted to have the highest preference for the βII′ + αR turn combination. However, BE-META simulations of cyclo-
(GFSEV) showed that the population of the desired structure (βII′ + αR) was only 55%, a modest improvement from the 53% in cyclo-(AAAAA). Indeed, when using the scoring functions
derived from the cyclo-(X1X2AAA) simulations results, the score for the βII′ + αR conformation for cyclo-(GFSDV), the proxy of cyclo-(GFSEV) because in the cyclo-(X1X2AAA) data set, X1/X2 could only be G, V, F, R, D, N, or S, ranked poorly at number 277, with a score of 1.051 (highlighted in red in Figure

5B). This observation veriﬁed the importance of incorporating the neighboring eﬀects in scoring the cyclic peptide’s structural
preference. Predicted βII′ + αR Structure of Cyclo-(GNSRV) Is
Supported by NMR. To corroborate our simulation
predictions, we synthesized cyclo-(GNSRV) and characterized
its structure in aqueous solution. NMR spectroscopy provided
high-resolution data describing the structural ensemble of
cyclo-(GNSRV) in water. The 1D spectrum and 2D spectra
from ROESY and TOCSY experiments provided ample
evidence that cyclo-(GNSRV) was well structured in water (Figures S2−S5), and these data were wholly consistent with the predicted type II′ β turn at 1GN2 and αR turn at R4 (Tables S7 and S8). Overall, protons had unique, well-resolved and
well-dispersed chemical shifts, consistent with a single
predominant structure. We observed several nuclear Overhauser eﬀects (NOEs) that support the predicted βII′ + αR structure. For example, for types I and I′ β turns, the distance
between the HN protons of the i + 1 and i + 2 residues and the distance between the HN protons of the i + 2 and i + 3 residues are both small (<3 Å); on the other hand, in types II and II′ β
turns, only the distance between the HN protons of the i + 2 and i + 3 residues is small (<3 Å) (Figure 1A). In the ROESY
spectra of cyclo-(GNSRV), we observed a strong NOE between Asn2(HN) and Ser3(HN) but no NOE was observed between Gly1(HN) and Asn2(HN) (Figures 7A, S6, and Table S7). The presence of this speciﬁc HN−HN NOE and the lack of the other NOE provides strong support for a type II or II′ β turn at residues 1GN2, rather than a type I or I′ β turn. Similarly, the
distance between the HN protons of the i + 1 and i + 2 residues

is only small in a αR or αL turn but not in a γ or γ′ turn (Figure 1A). We observed a strong NOE between Arg4(HN) and Val5(HN) (Figure S6 and Table S7), which supports an αR turn centered at Arg4. J values allowed estimation of the ϕ angle for Arg4 at −60 ± 30° (Figure S6 and Table S8), which is consistent with an αR turn rather than an αL turn. Similarly, the ϕ angles for Ser3 and Val5 were estimated at −120 ± 30° on the
basis of the J values, which are also in agreement with the
predicted structure (Figures 6A, S6, and Table S8). Design of an Unstructured Control for Cyclo-(GNSRV).
We observed that one of the parent sequences of the well-
structured cyclo-(GNSRV), cyclo-(VGAAA), adopted a relatively structured βII′ + αR conﬁguration (58%; Table S4), suggesting that it might be possible that any cyclic pentapeptide
containing the VG motif would have a rather strong preference for the βII′ + αR conﬁguration regardless of the rest of the sequence. To test this hypothesis, on the basis of our scoring
function, we designed a negative control, cyclo-(GFDNV)
(highlighted in red in Figure 5B), which contained the VG motif but had a low score for the βII′ + αR conﬁguration. BEMETA simulations showed that although the most populated cluster of cyclo-(GFDNV) still adopted a type II′ β turn at residues 1GF2 and an αR turn at N4, its population was, however, a mere 14.7% (Figure 6B).

To corroborate the simulation results of our negative control,
we synthesized and characterized cyclo-(GFDNV) using NMR spectroscopy (Figures S7−S10, Tables S9, and S10). Overall, speciﬁc NOEs and J values consistent with a single
predominant structure, as observed for cyclo-(GNSRV), were
not observed for cyclo-(GFDNV). For instance, instead of a distinct, selective pattern of HN−HN NOEs, we observed four out of the ﬁve possible HN−HN NOEs (Figure 7B and Table S9). This indicates that no one single structure predominates in solution but that multiple diﬀerent structures with various
underlying turn combinations are present. Also, J values allowed estimation of ϕ angles for Asp3 and Val5. Both of these values were estimated at −120 ± 30°, which was not consistent with an α turn at either residue (Table S10). Finally,
we observed an additional set of peaks within the NMR
spectrum of cyclo-(GFDNV) that integrated to roughly 33% of
the total peak volume (Figure S11). These are consistent with
the presence of two or more conformations within the
ensemble that are stable on the NMR timescale. This is
another clear indicator that this peptide does not have a single
predominant structure in aqueous solution. CD spectroscopy is complementary to NMR and provides a
low-resolution but informative measurement of the extent of
peptide structure in solution. As shown in Figure 7C, the CD

spectra of cyclo-(GNSRV) and cyclo-(GFDNV) show broad minima between 208 and 218 nm, consistent with mixed α-

helical and β-sheet structures. The negative ellipticity from cyclo-(GNSRV) is roughly fourfold more intense than that of cyclo-(GFDNV). Although it is diﬃcult to calculate the degree of structure accurately from CD data for cyclic peptides this small, these data do indicate a much higher degree of structure for cyclo-(GNSRV) compared to cyclo-(GFDNV).
■ CONCLUSIONS
In summary, using an eﬃcient enhanced sampling method tailored for CPs, we characterized the structural ensembles of more than 70 head-to-tail cyclized pentapeptides. We demonstrated the value of these data by using them to rationally design a CP with a high degree of structure in water. We note that this designed CP sequence is well structured despite a lack of proline residues. Inclusion of proline is a common strategy to stabilize turn structures but limits the design space for CP development.80
Although the scoring function derived from cyclo(X1X2AAA) enabled us to design well-structured CPs that adopt the βII′ + αR turn combination, the distribution of the scores shows that most sequences are likely not well structured (Figure 5B). Furthermore, the scores for the other turn combinations (such as βI + αR) are all minimal, suggesting that it would be extremely unlikely to favor these conformations using simple sequence substitutions. For example, cyclo(AFDAG) has the highest score to adopt βI + αR, with the type I β turn at 1AF2 and the tight αR turn at A4. However, this score is only 0.208. BE-META simulation of cyclo-(AFDAG) shows that indeed the top cluster of this CP was βI + αR, however, with a population of <30%. Therefore, to design wellstructured cyclic pentapeptides that adopt conformations other than the βII′ + αR turn combination demonstrated here, nonnatural amino acids are likely needed. D-Amino acids are a logical choice, although incorporating other non-natural amino acids, such as N-methylated amino acids, β-amino acids and proline analogs may also prove to be useful tools for CP design. The eﬀects of incorporating these non-natural amino acids are currently being investigated. The simulation platform reported here is also not limited to cyclic pentapeptides or head-to-tail cyclized peptides and can be readily extended to larger systems or macrocycles cyclized by other linking chemistries. This work is a clear demonstration of how rigorous, explicit-solvent simulation methods are opening new opportunities to rationally design CPs with desired structures, providing a platform to rationally design novel CPs.
