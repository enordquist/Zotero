ABSTRACT: In this contribution we explore by means of experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics the eﬀect of pore morphology on the spontaneous extrusion of nonwetting liquids from nanopores. Understanding and controlling this phenomenon is central for manipulating nanoconﬁned liquids, e.g., in nanoﬂuidic applications, drug delivery, and oil extraction. Qualitatively diﬀerent extrusion behaviors were observed in high-pressure water intrusion−extrusion experiments on porous materials with similar nominal diameter and hydrophobicity: macroscopic capillary models and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the very presence or absence of extrusion is connected to the internal morphology of the pores and, in particular, to the presence of small-scale roughness or pore interconnections. Additional experiments with mercury conﬁrmed that this mechanism is generic for nonwetting liquids and is rooted in the pore topology. The present results suggest a rational way to engineer heterogeneous systems for energy and nanoﬂuidic applications in which the extrusion behavior can be controlled via the pore morphology.

L iquids conﬁned in nanoporous materials often display peculiar behaviors which are exploited in a broad range of nanoﬂuidic and energy applications. A paradigmatic
example is represented by heterogeneous lyophobic systems
(HLSs) formed by a nanoporous material immersed in a nonwetting liquid; this rapidly growing research ﬁeld focuses
on the intrusion and extrusion behavior of HLSs for energy storage1−6 and energy dissipation7,8 with the ﬁnal goal of
engineering this class of materials. In HLSs, mechanical energy is stored in the form of liquid−solid interfacial energy during
the high-pressure intrusion of a liquid (often water) into the
lyophobic porous material. The pressure at which the liquid spontaneously extrudes from the pores (discharge) deﬁnes the
applicability of the HLS: if extrusion takes place at pressures comparable to the intrusion one,3,9 the HLS is suitable for
energy storage (molecular spring behavior). If, instead, the
extrusion pressure is considerably lower than the intrusion one6,7,10,11 (pressure hysteresis), the HLS can be used to
dissipate energy, e.g., mechanical vibrations (damper behavior) under repeated intrusion−extrusion cycles. Finally, if the
nonwetting liquid remains trapped in the pores even when the pressure is lowered down to the minimum working value,12 the
HLS can be used for dissipating the energy of a single impact
(bumper behavior).

The ultrahigh surface areas per gram typical of nanoporous materials,13,14 together with the high surface tension of water, make such systems more compact and eﬀective as compared to conventional technologies both for energy storage and for vibration damping. For example, a car shock absorber based on an HLS, where {water + grafted silica} is used as a working medium, outperforms conventional oil-based shock absorber in several important ways. First of all, the energy capacity is considerably higher due to the fact that HLS-based shock absorbers do not require cumbersome springs to decompress them after the impact. A high speciﬁc dissipation power of up to 50 W/cm3 was reported for an HLS-based shock absorber.11 Second, HLS-based shock absorbers are signiﬁcantly more environmentally friendly, as the amount of oil used is negligible as compared to oil-based shock absorbers.8,11,15 Finally, an HLS-based shock absorber can withstand exceptional frequencies of compression−decompression cycling.11,16,17 On the other hand, many applications based on HLSs are far behind, mainly because of the limited knowledge of pressure

hysteresisthe diﬀerence between intrusion and extrusion pressuresand of the strategies to control it.
The aforementioned cases illustrate how pressure hysteresis determines the use of HLSs. Notwithstanding its technological relevance, the design of systems with controlled pressure hysteresis remains a challenge due to the lack of predictive theories. It is known that both the intrusion and extrusion pressures depend on the chemistry and on the geometry of the pores,3,6,9,14,18 suggesting a route to control these phenomena. This insight is in agreement with the vast corpus focusing on the hydrophobic eﬀect, which has demonstrated that, in a variety of geometries, the formation of a conﬁned vapor phase analogous to extrusion is facilitated by hydrophobic cavities;19−30 such drying phenomena are of importance in diverse ﬁelds, including solution chemistry, protein folding, and superhydrophobicity. However, while for the intrusion pressure Laplace’s law,2,4,31 with nanoscale deviations for the smallest pores,32 is known to work, for extrusion a comprehensive theory is still lacking in complex geometries. This lack of a quantitative understanding severely limits the exploitation of nanoconﬁned liquids in applications: for instance, rationalizing the early suggestion that bubbles within the pores facilitate pore dewetting33 could lead to improved strategies to control the pressure hysteresis of HLS.
The aim of the present paper is to understand the characteristics of a porous material that determine its extrusion behavior and to suggest ﬂexible strategies to control the phenomenon. In particular, we focus on two commercial porous materials with similar pore sizes and chemistry but whose internal featurespore interconnections or roughness of the internal surfacesigniﬁcantly diﬀer. Our experiments show that these materials have qualitatively diﬀerent behavior for what concerns water extrusion: in one case, the liquid is forced out of the pores at pressures as large as a few megapascals; in the other case, instead, it does not extrude even when the pressure is decreased to the ambient value. In order to understand the origin of this qualitative diﬀerence, we employ models of pores that account for the essential topology of the two materials: one with independent pores and one with interconnected ones. We consider an increasing degree of sophistication for the behavior of water and for the solid− liquid interaction: a macroscopic capillarity model and a fully atomistic one; in the latter, mesoscale and nanoscale eﬀects such as disjoining pressure, line tension, and Tolman

corrections, are accounted for by the interatomic potentials without the need of ad hoc models. First, in the section Extrusion: Theory, the macroscopic model suggests that pore interconnections are a plausible explanation of extrusion in HLS. Second, in the section Extrusion: Molecular Dynamics, atomistic simulations conﬁrm that extrusion can be induced by internal roughness: free-energy calculations show a signiﬁcant reduction of the extrusion free-energy barrier compatible with the extrusion time recorded in experiments. Additional in silico intrusion−extrusion experiments substantiate our explanation in pressure cycles. In the ﬁnal section before the conclusions, we demonstrate experimentally that the ﬁndings obtained with water are general and apply also to the case of other nonwetting liquids and diﬀerent porous materials.
Summarizing, by combining experiments, macroscopic theory, and atomistic simulation, this work elucidates the role of nanoscale surface roughness or pore interconnections on the extrusion of liquids from nanoporous materials. The present results are valuable to further the development not only of HLSs but also of a broad variety of applications in which controlling the behavior of nanoconﬁned liquids is essential.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Experiments. The aim of the present experiments is to reveal the eﬀect of pore topology on the intrusion−extrusion pressure hysteresis. For this purpose, two hydrophobic porous materials with similar pore sizes but diﬀerent internal morphologies were subjected to high-pressure intrusion− extrusion experiments with water as the working liquid. Both materialsRPB and WC8were commercial silica gels grafted with a hydrophobic coating following the same protocol (see also the Methods section for further details on the materials). The resulting surface chemistries are characterized by the same (apparent) contact angle as measured from compacted silica pellets (see the Supporting Information, Figure SI1).
As a preliminary step, the two materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The TEM micrographs in Figure 1a and b show that the topology of the pores is very diﬀerent for the two materials: RPB is characterized by independent pores with an approximately cylindrical shape, while WC8 by randomly intersecting spheres. The disordered distribution of

the latter pores results in a network of spherical cages interconnected by interstices having sizes less than the cage diameter, i.e., less than ca. 10 nm. The SEM micrographs in the Supporting Information, Figure SI2a,b, conﬁrm that the cavity mouth of WC8 is on the order of 10 nm, but is inconclusive for RPB; for both materials it is diﬃcult to collect statistics from SEM micrographs, which are at the limit of our resolution and are restricted to small portions of the surface. We therefore performed nitrogen adsorption experiments (see the Supporting Information, Figure SI2c), which are able to quantify the pore size distribution of the entire sample and extract information about the pore topologies. For RPB, the adsorption/desorption cycle exhibited H1 hysteresis loops, with parallel branches typical of mesoporous materials with a regular array of cylindrical pores.34,35 On the other hand, WC8 was characterized by an H2 hysteresis loop that is typical of materials with interconnected networks of pores or ink-bottleshaped pores.34,35 The adsorption results conﬁrm the visual analysis of the pore topology based on TEM/SEM micrographs. Summarizing, the cages of WC8 form nanoroughness at their interconnections; on the contrary, the porosity of the RPB sample closely resembles end-capped, nonintersecting cylinders with a diameter that varies slightly along the length. The schematic representations of the pore topologies described above are illustrated in the insets of Figure 1a and b taking into account both SEM/TEM analysis and nitrogen adsorption experiments.
The nominal size of the pores is similar for the two materials, with WC8 characterized by slightly larger pores than RPB, as conﬁrmed by the pore size distributions of Figure SI2d: the typical size of the pores is 6 ± 1.5 nm for RPB and 9 ± 2.5 nm for WC8, with a small shoulder at 3.5 nm for RPB. Previous results have demonstrated the generic trend that freeenergy barriers for the formation of a conﬁned vapor phase decrease as the size of conﬁnement is decreased;22,25,27,36 therefore, based solely on the simplest information about the porestheir size and surface chemistryone would expect that the transition from wet pores to dry ones is favored6,31 in the RPB case. It will be shown in the following that this simplistic prediction is not fulﬁlled because of the nontrivial role that pore topology plays in extrusion.
The main experiment consists in intrusion−extrusion cycles on a system comprising water as the nonwetting liquid and hydrophobized RPB and WC8 as the porous materials. The cycles were performed by varying quasi-statically the pressure, which facilitates the comparison with the theory. The results are reported in Figure 1c. The two samples have a similar behavior while increasing the pressure from the ambient value: for RPB intrusion occurred at ca. 17 MPa and for WC8 at ca. 18 MPa, which is compatible with the expectations for hydrophobic pores of a few nanometers. On the other hand, the extrusion branch of the experiments was in stark contrast with the initial expectation, showing completely diﬀerent properties when the pressure is decreased: in the case of RPB, there were no signs of extrusion, while, in the case of WC8, complete extrusion was observed in a repeatable manner at 2 MPa. In the following we try to address this surprising behavior by closely analyzing the eﬀect of pore morphology on extrusion.
The fact that the porous matrix and the coating are the same for the two systems allows us to rule out the explanation that water chemisorbs diﬀerently on the two materials. In addition, the experiments of the section Generalizing the Eﬀect of

Microroughness on the Extrusion Pressure show the same diﬀerence in extrusion behavior is observed when the intruding liquid is mercury, the porous materials are diﬀerent, and there is no coating. Overall, the intrusion−extrusion results combined with the materials characterization (Figure 1) suggest that subtle diﬀerences in the pore topology could be at the origin of the qualitatively diﬀerent extrusion behavior of the two systems. In the next sections we present a macroscopic theory and molecular dynamics simulations targeted at elucidating the microscopic mechanism giving rise to extrusion. Given the randomness of the porous materials, we do not aim at building a realistic model of the pores but rather to understand the generic geometrical and/or chemical characteristics that inﬂuence the extrusion properties of a porous material. Combining macroscopic arguments and more detailed atomistic simulations allowed us to rationalize the experimental results and yields a plausible explanation for the reported extrusion behavior.
Extrusion: Theory. In order to understand the extrusion behavior of the two porous materials, it is important to remark that during extrusion the system must overcome the freeenergy barrier associated with the formation of a vapor (or gas) bubble replacing the liquid;6,27,31 in other words, extrusion is a nucleation process. In the case of hydrophobic cavities, it has been shown27,30,37 that this bubble forms preferentially at speciﬁc locations of the cavity walls and that the free-energy barrier ΔΩ† is determined by the balance of the free-energy cost of forming a liquid/vapor interface, only partly balanced by the reduction of contact area between liquid water and the hydrophobic solid, and the free-energy gain due to the ﬁlling of the cavity by the stable vapor phase. The extrusion time depends exponentially on the barrier determined by this competition:38

t = t0 exp[ΔΩ†/(kBT)]

(1)

where the pre-exponential factor t0 has a typical value of 10−12 s.19,39 When the barrier is much higher than the thermal energy available to the system, ΔΩ† ≫ kBT, the extrusion time exceeds the typical experimental time and, in practice, no

extrusion is observed. The extrusion process is the conﬁned analogue of vapor
nucleation in bulk water;38 for the present case, however, the

surface chemistry and the geometry of the cavity become

important. In order to connect the free-energy barrier to the

characteristics of the cavity, we use a combined approach: (1)

we employ the (computationally inexpensive) macroscopic

sharp-interface model, which is described in detail below, to

determine the dependence of the free-energy barrier on the

morphology of the pores in terms of simple experimental

parameters such as the geometry of the pore, the surface

chemistry of the material, and the liquid/solid contact area,

and (2) we validate these results and obtain microscopic

insights from molecular dynamics. We remark that, despite its

simplicity, the sharp-interface model can give semiquantitative results for cavities as small as 10 nm.30

The sharp-interface model assumes that the thermodynamic quantities related to the diﬀerent phases, e.g., density and

pressure, are constant up to the mathematical dividing

interface, where there is a sharp change in these properties. For the present case of a pore partially ﬁlled with liquid, three phases are present: (ﬁxed) solid, liquid, and vapor. According

to the sharp-interface model, the free energy of such a system is19,37,40

where ΔP = Pl − Pv, with Pl and Pv the pressures of the bulk liquid water and vapor, respectively, Φ ≡ Vl/Vp is the ﬁlling fraction deﬁned by the ratio between the liquid volume Vl and the total volume of the pore Vp, Alv, Asv, and Asl are the liquid− vapor, solid−vapor, and solid−liquid surface areas, respectively, and γ, γsv, and γsl are the corresponding surface tensions. As for any thermodynamic potential, Ω is known up to a constant, which is always set to zero in the following expressions. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of eq 2 corresponds to the energy of the bulk liquid and vapor in a system containing both phases. The other three terms account for the energy cost/gain related to the formation of liquid− vapor, solid−liquid, and solid−vapor interfaces. Introducing Young’s law cos θY ≡ (γsv − γsl)/γ, it is possible to recast eq 2 into the form21,22
Ω = ΔP(1 − Φ)Vp + γ(Alv + Asvcos θY) + const (3)
which underscores the competition between γsv and γsl and provides a geometric interpretation of capillarity, distinguishing between hydrophobic surfaces (for which θY > 90° implies a free-energy gain from drying) and hydrophilic (θY < 90°) ones.
The next ingredient required to compute the free-energy barriers (and thus the nucleation kinetics) is the extrusion path and the associated free energy.41 Here we use the continuum rare event method (CREaM),37,42,43 in which the extrusion path consists of the sequence of the meniscus morphologies having the lowest free energy at each value of the ﬁlling fraction Φ. The extrusion path originating from this prescription is a sequence of spherical-cap menisci meeting the interior of the pore with contact angle θY. In particular, the vapor bubble delimited by the meniscus increases its volume, Vv = (1 − Φ)Vp, during extrusion, encompassing the range between the fully wet (Φ = 1) and the empty pore (Φ = 0). Within the CREaM framework Alv and Asv are a function of Φ, and, after setting the remaining thermodynamic parameters to the experimental values, it was possible to evaluate via eq 2 the free-energy prof ile as a function of Φ.
The CREaM approach explained above is applied to minimal pore models designed to capture the essential topology of the experimental pores together with their size and surface chemistry: the independent pores of RPB are schematized as smooth spherical caps of radius rp = 5 nm, with a mouth of radius rm = 4 nm and with θY = 115° (Figure 2a,

left). The pore model for WC8 will be presented below. Figure 2a reports the free-energy proﬁle connected with extrusion from the smooth pore with spherical-cap geometry at ΔP = 0
MPa (cyan line). These parameters have been chosen to match
approximately the experimental materials and conditions. In
particular, the theoretical intrusion pressure computed for our model via the macroscopic (sharp-interface) Laplace’s law, ΔPint = −2γ cos(θY + α)/rm ≈ 23 MPa, is in fair agreement with the experimental value, with γ = 0.072 N/m and α = 15°, where α is the re-entrant angle of the pore mouth in Figure 2a.
The free-energy proﬁle in Figure 2a shows a local minimum
(metastable state) in correspondence with the fully wet state at Φ = 1, a maximum (unstable state, also referred to as transition state), and the absolute minimum (stable state) at Φ = 0, with
the meniscus pinned at the pore mouth corresponding to the
extruded liquid (not shown). The extrusion free-energy barrier is deﬁned as ΔΩ† = Ωts − Ωf, where Ωts and Ωf are the free energy of the transition state (free-energy maximum) and of the ﬁlled pore, respectively.
In order to illustrate how changing the pressure determines
extrusion, we now follow a thought experiment, assuming a
slow variation of the pressure in agreement with the quasi-
static experimental procedure. At the beginning of the
extrusion process, when the pressure is high (30 MPa in the present experiments), the system is in the fully wet state at Φ = 1; there, the free energy is lower than that at Φ = 0, i.e., ΔΩ = Ωe − Ωf > 0 and the ﬁlled state is more stable than the empty one. As the pressure decreases, ΔΩ becomes smaller and eventually, at suﬃciently low pressures, becomes negative and the empty state is more stable than the ﬁlled one. However, the barrier ΔΩ† might still be too large, determining the condition t ≫ texp, where texp is the experimental time, and the extrusion is not observed. Upon further reducing the pressure, the barrier ΔΩ† becomes small enough (ΔΩ† ≈ 25 kBT, corresponding to t = 1 s) such that t ≤ texp and extrusion takes place. Since ΔΩ† is an increasing function of ΔP, to understand if a transition
can be observed on the experimental time scale at positive pressures, it is suﬃcient to compute the free-energy barrier at ΔP = 0. The sharp-interface model of the pores yields ΔΩ† ≈ 400 kBT at ΔP = 0 (see Figure 2a, cyan line), which implies a nucleation time t ≈ 10161 s, much larger than the age of the
universe. Only for barriers on the order of 25 kBT it is possible to observe a transition in an experimentally relevant time.
The previous results show that the smooth, spherical-cap
pore model with contact angle and size approximately matched

to the experimental ones does not exhibit extrusion at positive
pressures. This result is in agreement with the behavior of RPB
(Figure 1a) but in marked contrast with that of WC8 (Figure
1b): the free-energy barrier must be much lower for WC8 in
order to allow for extrusion. Since this discrepancy cannot be ascribed to a diﬀerence in the surface chemistry (for water the maximum θY is limited to ca. 115°), we propose that it is associated with the nanometer-sized pore interconnections present in WC8, which eﬀectively decrease the solid−liquid
contact within the pores. Indeed, owing to their small size and
hydrophobicity, such small pore interconnections are not
intruded at the pressures at which the main pore is and, even if
they become intruded at much higher pressures, they are likely
to spontaneously dry as soon as the pressure is decreased close to ΔP = 0.6,7,29,30,32 The deeper reason that these nanoscale
interconnections are always dry under ambient conditions is that the free-energy barriers decrease as the size of conﬁnement is decreased,22,25,36 up to the point in which the wet state is not a minimum anymore.32 As conﬁrmed below by
molecular dynamics simulations (see the section Extrusion:
Molecular Dynamics and Figure SI8 of the Supporting Information), the main eﬀect of pore interconnections is thus that of permanently replacing a portion of the solid− liquid contact with a liquid−vapor one (at least at ΔP = 0), forming, within the pore, a composite liquid−solid−vapor
interface quite distinct from smooth pores as, for example, the
independent RPB pores. In other words, it is highly likely that,
within pore interconnections, a nanoscale bubble is always present, considerably facilitating extrusion. With this eﬀect in
mind, we further simplify our model of pore interconnections
by substituting them with a rough internal surface with
nanometer-sized textures (Figure 2) remaining dry at all
experimental conditions. The eﬀect of dry roughness can be included eﬀectively in the
free energy (eq 3) by considering the solid area fraction χs = As/Ap where As is the area of the spherical cap occupied by the solid and Ap is the total area of the spherical cap. This is the fraction of internal solid surface that can actually get in contact
with the liquid:

Ω = ΔP(1 − Φ)Vp + γ{Alv + Asv[χs(cos θY + 1) − 1]} (4)

where Asv has to be understood as the nominal solid−vapor area, i.e., the area one would measure for the extrusion from a

smooth spherical-cap pore. We remark that eq 4 is obtained following the classical derivation44 for the free energy of a

liquid deposited on a composite liquid−solid and solid−vapor

interface. [In the superhydrophobic community the concept of

apparent or Cassie−Baxter contact angle θCB is often introduced in order to describe the homogenized free energy of a surface in the superhydrophobic state.44−46 This angle is

connected to the additional terms in eq 4 via the Cassie−

Baxter law: cos θCB = χs(cos θY + 1) − 1.] The free-energy proﬁles relative to χs = 1 (smooth spherical
cap), χs = 0.62, and χs = 0.23 in Figure 2a (cyan, black, and orange lines) show a progressive reduction of the free-energy

barriers as the solid fraction 0.23, the barrier decreases to

is reduced. ΔΩ† ≈ 25

In particular, kBT and it is

for χs = possible

to achieve extrusion on the time scale of seconds even from a

surface with a standard hydrophobic surface chemistry (e.g.,

with the maximum achievable with water, around θY = 115°). The macroscopic model presented above suggests that a

viable explanation of the observation of extrusion in WC8 is

the presence, on the pore walls, of internal dry nanocavities.
This scenario is compatible with the hydrophobicity of
silanized silica, with the experimental intrusion pressure, and with the diﬀerence in the pore interconnections between RPB
(independent pores) and WC8 (interconnected pores). In order to conﬁrm whether this macroscopic prediction is actually veriﬁed at the scale of the experimental pores,
atomistic simulations of a nanopore with internal roughness
were performed and are presented in the next section. Extrusion: Molecular Dynamics. The system considered
in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations consisted of a
pore excavated from a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fcc crystal in
contact with (liquid and/or vapor) TIP4P water. The basic
pore geometry was a spherical cap with a radius of 5 nm and a
mouth radius of ca. 4 nm (Figure 2b), which are close to the
nominal dimensions of the actual pores (Figure 1a,b). The
solid particles interacted with the oxygen atoms of the water molecules by the modiﬁed LJ potential vLJ, O(r) = 4ϵ[(σ/r)12 − c(σ/r)6], where the parameter c, set to 0.85, allowed us to tune the Young contact angle to θY = 118°, close to the value of the actual samples, θY = 115°. A second set of pores with internal roughness was considered; these systems were obtained
starting from smooth spherical-cap pores and excavating, from the internal surface of the sphere, a diﬀerent number of
cylindrical nanocavities of radius 1.25 nm and depth 2.2 nm. This procedure allowed us to obtain two diﬀerent solid fractions: χs = 0.65 and χs = 0.47 (Figure 2, green and blue lines, respectively). We refer to this second geometry as the
bomb (the reason for this wording being that the geometry of
these cavities is similar to the negative of a naval mine). All
MD simulations were performed at constant number of
particles, at constant temperature, and controlling the liquid pressure via a piston.47
In order to obtain the atomistic free-energy barrier for
extrusion and thus have a direct comparison with the sharp-
interface calculations of Figure 2a, we computed the atomistic free-energy proﬁle as a function of the ﬁlling fraction for the bomb geometries with χs = 0.65 and χs = 0.47 and for the smooth spherical-cap pore with χs = 1 (Figure 2b; further details on the free-energy method are included in the Methods section). In this “discrete” case the deﬁnition of the ﬁlling fraction is Φ ≡ (N − Ne)/(Nf − Ne), with Ne and Nf being the number of particles in the pore in the empty and ﬁlled states, respectively, at ΔP = 0. With this deﬁnition, it is possible to observe the conditions Φ > 1, when the liquid is compressed
(smooth cavity) or penetrates the smaller cavities (model pore with interconnection), and Φ < 0, when the meniscus is curved
toward the external part of the cavity. The extrusion freeenergy barrier thus computed was ΔΩ† = 155 kBT for the smooth pore at ΔP = 0 MPa (Figure 2): this high barrier
kinetically prevents liquid extrusion at positive pressures, in
accord with the behavior of RPB. Comparison of the freeenergy proﬁles for the smooth and bomb cases in Figure 2b underscores that the presence of nanocavities signiﬁcantly
reduced the extrusion barrier, as expected from the macroscopic model. In particular, for χs = 0.47, ΔΩ† is lower than 25 kBT, which implies that this geometry is a good candidate to observe extrusion during an experiment of a few seconds. It is
worth mentioning that the value predicted by the sharpinterface model to obtain a transition was χs = 0.25, which is a rather conservative estimate as compared to this atomistic prediction. This diﬀerence is connected to the fact that the
free-energy barriers computed in the sharp-interface approx-

imation are typically larger48 than those predicted by atomistic simulations due to the presence of diﬀuse interfaces.
Finally, we remark that, consistently with the hypothesis put forward in the previous section, at ΔP = 0 cylindrical nanocavities are always devoid of liquid, as one deduces from the absence of any minimum of the free energy in correspondence to the their wet state (Φ > 1).
The (computationally expensive) free-energy simulations, performed at ΔP = 0, suggested that internal roughness or pore interconnections indeed facilitate extrusion. In order to ensure that this behavior is actually observed in experiments in which the pressure is varied, we performed the in silico equivalent of the experiments in Figure 1c; see also ref 49.

The numerical experiment for the smooth pore (Figure 3a) was initialized with the pore in the empty state (Φ = 0) at ΔP = 0 MPa. As the pressure was increased, the pore remained empty with the meniscus pinned at the mouth and progressively sagging into the pore (ΔP < 23 MPa). When a critical pressure value (intrusion pressure) was reached, ΔPint = 23 MPa, water abruptly wet the pore, reaching Φ = 1. The value of the MD intrusion pressure was close to the experimental one and in fair agreement with the macroscopic expectation given by Laplace’s law, ΔPint ≈ 21 MPa, where the values γ = 0.062 N/m (the surface tension of TIP4P-Ew water50), α = 15°, θY = 118°, and rm ≈ 4 nm were used. Finally, any further increase of the pressure produced minor changes in Φ due to the low compressibility of water.
From the condition ΔP = 50 MPa and Φ = 1, the pressure was progressively decreased (green line in Figure 3a). At the minimum pressure reached in the actual experiments, ΔP = 0, we did not observe extrusion of water out of the pore: this behavior is compatible with RPB, for which no extrusion was observed (Figure 1c). Unlike in experiments, in the MD intrusion/extrusion cycle the time amenable of simulations is a few nanoseconds; therefore, we continued depressurizing the system down to negative pressures (tensile state) in order to facilitate extrusion;6,49 in other words, in standard MD, extrusion can be observed only when ΔΩ† is smaller than in experiments. Even at large negative pressures (ΔP ≈ −40 MPa) water completely occupied the pore without extrusion. These extreme tensile conditions are diﬃcult to explore in experiments but are easily accessible to simulation.

The same protocol was followed for the bomb geometry (Figure 3b): the intrusion part of the process was equivalent to the smooth pore, with the transition from the empty to the fully wet state triggered at ΔPint = 23 MPa. Instead, during decompression, when the system reached a pressure ΔPext = −2 MPa, a bubble nucleated within the pore and the liquid was extruded from the pore, restoring the empty state (the reason for the relatively small negative extrusion pressure is explained in the following). The comparison of the two virtual intrusion−extrusion experiments in Figure 3 clearly shows that surface roughness within the pores plays an important role in determining the behavior of a porous material, causing a qualitatively diﬀerent extrusion behavior, even when the intrusion behavior is similar. Finally, contrasting Figure 1c and Figure 3 demonstrates that our atomistic models capture the behavior of RPM and WC8 pores under intrusion− extrusion experiments, based on minimal ingredients: they have roughly the same sizes, identical surface chemistry (θY = 118°), but diﬀerent topologies, which allows for extrusion in the case of the interconnected WC8 pores (Figure 1).
In Figure SI7 of the Supporting Information we analyze the eﬀect of internal roughness on the cycle when the maximum pressure is signiﬁcantly larger than the intrusion one for the main pore. In this case, the presence of internal roughness causes a small additional intrusion/extrusion loop due to the wetting of these nanocavities at very large pressures. This second loop, however, becomes undetectable in actual experiments if the internal roughness has a volume much smaller than the main pores, as expected for pore interconnections.
At variance with the actual experiment, in the MD pressure cycle a relatively small negative extrusion pressure was recorded (we restate that no extrusion was observed in the smooth case). As explained above, the exact value of the extrusion pressure depends on the time scale of the experiment as implied by the expression for t(ΔP) obtained by combining eqs 1 and 2; longer time scales correspond to higher pressures, see, for example, Figure 5a of ref 6. In the MD experiment the time scale was on the order of 10−9 s, while in the actual experiment ca. 1 s. This diﬀerence in the observation time scales therefore can explain the quantitative discrepancy between the MD and the experimental extrusion pressures, which is due to the much shorter time scale accessible to MD. The quantitative discussion of this point is beyond the scope of this paper and will be investigated in a forthcoming work.
Altogether, the simulation campaign has shown that the characteristics of the internal surface of a porous material critically aﬀect its extrusion behavior. In particular, a second tier of smaller nanocavities in the internal surface of the main pores, corresponding to surface roughness or to the interconnections between pores, facilitates the drying of the pores, a result that accounts for the reported experimental behavior. Such ﬁndings shed light on how the ﬁne features of a porous material inﬂuence pressure hysteresis, a step that enables the control and optimization of the energy-related capabilities of such materials.
In addition to porous materials for energy applications, the present results are also relevant for understanding the wetting and drying of superhydrophobic surfaces with diﬀerent scales of roughness: in this context, empty and wet states of the pores correspond to the Cassie−Baxter44 (superhydrophobic) and Wenzel51 (non-superhydrophobic) states of the nanotexture, respectively. The present results demonstrate that a surface

with hierarchical textures, e.g., with the smaller roughness on
the 1 nm scale and a larger one, facilitates the recovery of the
superhydrophobic state on a large scale without the need of an
external energy supply: the smaller nanocavities reduce the solid−liquid contact, facilitating the expulsion of the liquid
from the larger pore. A clear paradigm emerges for engineering
the recovery of the superhydrophobic state, i.e., the use of a
hierarchical textured surface. Such a principle was proposed in a previous theoretical work,32 and its eﬀectiveness is
substantiated by the present molecular dynamics simulations. Generalizing the Eﬀect of Microroughness on the
Extrusion Pressure. In order to demonstrate the generality of
these conclusions, two additional HLSs based on mercury and diﬀerent porous silica were subject to intrusion−extrusion
experiments. Mercury was chosen as the most common
nonwetting liquid with well-developed experimental protocols. The fact that mercury forms large contact angles (θY ≈ 140°, satisfying the nonwetting condition θY > 90°) with nearly all the common materials allows using porous materials without graf ting for intrusion−extrusion cycling experiments. This characteristic signiﬁcantly broadens the range of available
nanoporous materials, giving access to model-like topologies.
In particular, MCM-41 porous silica was used, which presents
model-like nonintersecting uniform cylindrical pores (Figure
4b). Another porous silica, G60, represents disordered pores

with intersections of diﬀerent sizes including micropores
(Figure 4d). By comparing Figure 4a and c, a drastic diﬀerence in
intrusion−extrusion pressure hysteresis is apparent: for (MCM-41 + mercury) the diﬀerence between intrusion and extrusion pressures is very large, exceeding 200 MPa. For (G60 + mercury), instead, intrusion−extrusion hysteresis is negli-
gible, even though the pores of G60 silica are, on average, about 2 nm larger than those of MCM-41. Such a diﬀerence becomes even more apparent in a diﬀerential representation,
when one compares the peaks of compressibility (dV/dP) for the intrusion and extrusion steps (Figure 4a and c). We
attribute the negligible pressure hysteresis of (G60 + mercury)
to the microroughness present in G60 silica: the intersections of the disordered pores. Such microroughness is visible in the TEM micrographs (Figure 4d) and is reﬂected in the
compressibility curve presenting a secondary peak corresponding to pores with a characteristic size of less than 4 nm (Figure
4c). Such roughness seems to facilitate the extrusion process as
in the bomb geometry and in WC8; as a result, the extrusion from 8.0−5.5 nm pores is nonhysteretic (Figure 4c). On the
contrary, MCM-41 does not present any microroughness in
addition to the highly ordered, nonintersecting pores in the 4.5−3.5 nm range (Figure 4b); this structure results in a highly hysteretic intrusion−extrusion cycle (Figure 4a). The present
results for mercury are consistent with those of ref 52, where

mercury porosimetry data were shown to have lower intrusion−extrusion hysteresis when the pores had higher surface fractal dimension.
The signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the pressure hysteresis reported for (MCM-41 + mercury) and (G60 + mercury) is in agreement with the conclusions of the previous sections on water and demonstrate that hysteresis in intrusion−extrusion cycles can be controlled solely by means of pore topology for a variety of nonwetting liquids. This understanding may be used to design the optimal topology of the pores to achieve the desired functional properties, e.g., an intrusion−extrusion cycle with controlled hysteresis.
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the eﬀect of the internal topology of porous materials on the extrusion of nonwetting liquids has been investigated via experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Concerning experiments, isothermal pressure cycles were performed on two samples with similar nominal pore characteristics that showed qualitatively diﬀerent extrusion behaviors: surprisingly, the material characterized by larger pores extruded (WC8) when depressurized, while the other did not (RPB). Nitrogen adsorption experiments and TEM micrographs of the two samples conﬁrmed that the pore sizes were comparable but the pore topology was diﬀerent: WC8 has highly interconnected pores, while RPB has semiindependent ones. In order to understand the eﬀect of these ﬁne characteristics of the pores on the extrusion behavior, a minimal theoretical model of the pore was employed. A macroscopic, sharp-interface model for liquid extrusion shed light on two aspects: (i) it explained in terms of free-energy barriers the lack of extrusion for RPB and (ii) it suggested a critical feature capable of triggering extrusion, i.e., a secondary scale of roughness at the inner surface of the pores, e.g., associated with intricate pore interconnections. The presence of such roughness gives rise to a superhydrophobic state at the pore walls and reduces liquid/solid contact area, facilitating the creation of the extrusion bubble. A lower solid fraction corresponds to a lower nucleation free-energy barrier, which, in turn, controls the time needed to observe a transition from the fully wet to the dry state, i.e., extrusion.
This macroscopic prediction was corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations of intrusion and extrusion in a sphericalcap pore with smaller cylindrical nanocavities on its surface, which indeed showed water extrusion upon depressurization as opposed to a spherical-cap pore without such nanocavities. Atomistic free-energy calculations further showed that (1) the nanometer-sized roughness remains empty at the experimental pressures and (2) extrusion is observed at a value of the solid fraction larger than the (conservative) macroscopic predictions.
These ﬁndings were further generalized by performing mercury intrusion−extrusion experiments for two porous silica with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent topologies: MCM-41, characterized by highly ordered nonintersecting cylinders, and G60, by disordered pores with microroughness due to the numerous intersections. A drastic diﬀerence in mercury intrusion− extrusion pressure hysteresis for these two materials was observed, with G60 showing almost no hysteresis. This result conﬁrmed the paramount importance of microroughness and pore interconnections in favoring liquid extrusion independently of the speciﬁc nonwetting liquid employed.

Summarizing, experiments combined with macroscopic and atomistic models suggest that the qualitatively diﬀerent extrusion behaviors observed for mesoporous materials depend on the characteristics of the inner surface of the pores, in particular, on the number of pore interconnections. This material parameter can be used to tailor the extrusion behavior of porous materials. In addition to experimental evidence, the presented theories constitute a comprehensive framework to predict the intrusion and extrusion behavior of porous materials based on their topology. These results may prove instrumental to advance a wide range of applications rooted in nanoscale capillary phenomena including superhydrophobic surfaces, nanoﬂuidics, energy storage, drug delivery, oil−water separation, and oil extraction.
METHODS
Experimental Materials and Methods. Materials. In this work we used two HLSs based on distilled water: (RPB + water) and (WC8 + water). WC8 is a commercial mesoporous silica gel in the shape of 6−8 μm granules grafted with the octylsilanes C8 with a density of 2.1 groups/nm2 according to the data provided by the supplier (SymmetryPrep C8 by Waters). WC8 stands for Waters C8. RPB is another commercial mesoporous silica gel grafted in the same way as WC8 (LiChroprep RP-select B by Merck). Additionally, we used two HLSs based on mercury: (G60 + mercury) and (MCM-41 + mercury). G60 is a commercial mesoporous silica from Davisil, where G60 stands for Grace 60Å. MCM-41 porous silica was synthesized following the protocol53 described below. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were used as the source of silicon and structure-directing agent, respectively. CTAB (1.4 g) was added to deionized water (60 mL) in a 150 mL beaker while the mixture was stirred at room temperature. After 10 min, ammonium hydroxide (3.52 g) was added to the above solution under stirring for 30 min until a clear solution was obtained. Then, TEOS (3.73 g) was added dropwise to the solution. The mixture was kept stirring with 350 rpm speed. After 2 h a milky solution was obtained; this solution was transferred into a Teﬂon-lined autoclave and treated under autogenous pressure without stirring at 373 K for 15 h. Then, the solid product was ﬁltered from the mother liquor and washed with deionized water. The sample was dried at 100 °C for 4 h. The obtained white powder was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to remove any remaining surfactant. All chemicals and reagents used for the synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further puriﬁcation.
Methods. High-pressure compression−decompression experiments were performed using a Pore Master 60 mercury porosimeter from Quantachrome Instruments. For mercury-based HLSs, the intrusion− extrusion experiments were executed following the standard procedure of mercury porosimetry. Namely, materials were subjected to outgassing up to 30 Pa prior to mixing with mercury. Next the system was compressed−decompressed in the required pressure range for at least 10 times to ensure repeatability. The pore size distribution was calculated using Laplace’s law, using standard values of θY = 140° for contact angle and γ = 480 mN/m for the surface tension of mercury. For water-based HLSs, RPB or WC8 was mixed with water and encapsulated into ﬂexible, hermetic Teﬂon capsules prior to the procedure described above.
Textural properties were characterized in an automated gas adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2460). Nitrogen sorption curves of the samples were measured, under isothermal conditions, after outgassing at 200 °C in vacuum for 5 h. The multipoint surface area was evaluated with the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller method over the range P/P0 = 0.075−0.35, where P0 is the saturated pressure of nitrogen, and the pore size distribution was obtained using the Barrett−Joyner−Halenda model applied to the desorption isotherm branch. The total pore volume was determined from the volume adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.98.

TEM measurements were realized by using a FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope operating at 200 kV. For TEM measurements, samples were dispersed in ethanol and sonicated; subsequently, the resulting solution was transferred onto a holey carbon ﬁlm ﬁxed on a 3 mm copper grid (200 mesh). Additional samples were imaged by a Quanta 200 FEG SEM microscope operated in high-vacuum mode at 30 kV featuring an Everhart-Thornley secondary electron detector.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Model. Water molecules were represented by the TIP4P-Ew model.54 The interaction between the oxygen and the solid particles of the walls was described by the modiﬁed LJ potential: v(r) = 4ϵ[(σ/r)12 − c(σ/r)6], where r is the distance between the oxygen and the wall particles, ϵ = 0.162 75 kcal/ mol, and σ = 3.164 35 nm are the characteristic energy and length of the LJ interaction, respectively. The parameter c was tuned as to achieve the desired θY, computed as the contact angle of a sessile water drop deposited on a ﬂat substrate.6,30 Here, we set c = 0.85, which corresponds to θY = 118°. Hydrogen and wall atoms did not interact. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the directions parallel to the wall. The atoms of the textured surface were kept ﬁxed during the simulation, while the atoms of the upper solid surface (piston) were allowed to move only in the wall-normal direction. The system was kept at T = 300 K by a Nose−́ Hoover chains thermostat.55 The molecular dynamics engine was LAMMPS.56
Intrusion and Extrusion Experiment. The MD intrusion and extrusion experiment consisted in applying a constant pressure to the system and measuring the quantity of water molecules inside the pore. After a suﬃciently long simulation, the pressure was increased in steps until intrusion was achieved; eventually, the pressure was decreased to mimic the extrusion phase. The pressure of the system was controlled via the upper solid wall, which acted as a piston on the bulk of the water outside the spherical-cap pore. A constant force f was applied to each wall atom in the direction normal to the upper wall such that, at equilibrium, the pressure of the liquid water balanced the external pressure:47,48 ApPl = f Np, where Ap and Np are the area and number of particles of the piston, respectively, and Pl is the water pressure (see also the Supporting Information, Figures SI5 and SI6). Finally, due to the low vapor tension Pv of water, the quantity ΔP = Pl − Pv was approximated as ΔP ≈ Pl. In order to compute the ﬁlling fraction Φ, we deﬁned the observable Ξ(r) counting the number of water molecules in a region containing the pore. The time average ⟨Ξ⟩ of this observable at a given pressure was used for computing the ﬁlling fraction in Figures 2 and 3: Φ = (⟨Ξ⟩ − Ne)/(Nf − Ne), where Nf and Ne are the number of water molecules in the fully wet and empty states, respectively. From this deﬁnition, Φ = 1 and Φ = 0 correspond to the fully wet and empty states, respectively.
Free-Energy Computations. Experimental results and MD simulations were interpreted in terms of quasi-static theories of thermally activated events.41,57,58 Even though these theories neglect some dynamical eﬀects, which can be taken into account in other approaches,59−61 they make the interpretation of results simple and intuitive.
Free-energy proﬁles were computed using restrained molecular dynamics (RMD), which is a static version of temperature-accelerated MD.62 In RMD the central quantity to compute is the derivative of the free energy dΩ/dΦ, from which Ω is determined by numerical integration. RMD amounts to adding a restraining potential, vr = k/ 2(Φ(r) − Φ*)2, to the physical one, where Φ(r) is the ﬁlling fraction deﬁned above. This potential, for suitably large values of the constant k, restrains the system close to the condition Φ(r) = Φ*. In RMD, the quantity dΩ/dΦ is given by dΩ/dΦ = k⟨(Φ* − Φ(r))⟩RMD, where the symbol ⟨·⟩RMD denotes the time average in the RMD simulation. In a nutshell, one runs many independent RMD simulations at diﬀerent values of Φ* in order to compute dΩ/dΦ; the free-energy proﬁle is then reconstructed by numerical integration.
