We have developed a methodfor calculating the stability in water ofprotein structures, starting from their atomic coordinates. The contribution of each protein atom to the solvation free energy is estimated as the product of the accessibility of the atom to solvent and its atomic solvation parameter. Applications of the method include estimates of the relative stability ofdifferent protein conformations, estimates of the free energy ofbinding ofligands to proteins and atomic-level descriptions of hydrophobicity and amphiphilicity.

for estimating the contribution of solvation energy to protein

of each amino-acid residue can be summarized by a single number, the amino-acid hydrophobicity8- 12• This is an oversim-

The

basic

assumption

is

that

the free energy of interaction of a solute with water can be

considered as a sum of energies of atomic groups. We follow

Langmuir in using the exposed surface areas of a group as a

measure of its interaction with solvent. In practice we use the solvent-accessible surface area of Lee and Richards20 and other recent workers21 - 24_ This is defined as the area over which the
centre of a water molecule of radius 1.4 A can move while

maintaining unobstructed contact with the group. In our method,

the sign and strength of the water-solvent interaction are

specified by the atomic solvation parameter (ASP) of each atom

accessible to water. These values are determined, as described

below, from free energies of transfer8- 12• Thus, our method effectively combines two common approaches for evaluating hydrophobic forces: computation of solvent-accessible surface areas; and estimating energies from free energies of transfer. Our method, however, extends the first approach by weighting the effect of each atom by its polar or apolar character, and extends the second in permitting calculation of the solvation energy from the coordinates of individual atoms in each residue. It advances both methods in permitting estimates of the free energy of transfer of small molecules and of the contribution of solvation to the free energy of binding of small molecules to proteins.

Atomic contributions
Here we express the contribution of protein-solvent interactions to the free energy of protein folding as a sum over all atoms of the structure (except hydrogen atoms, which are not treated explicitly). The term for each atom is the product of its solventaccessible area20 and its ASP for transfer from the interior of a protein to aqueous solution. The transfer to solution of a single atom, i, immersed in protein is depicted in Fig. 1a. Let the accessible surface area of the atom be given by Ai, and its atomic solvation parameter be given by ~ai. Then the free energy of transfer (~G) is
(1)

Now consider the transfer to water of amino-acid residue R immersed in protein (Fig. la). We assume that the change in free energy for this process can be approximated as a sum of atomic terms, each like that of equation (2)

neighbours. We assume that conformation is not significantly changed during transfer.
The validity of equation (2) can be tested by a fit to experimental free energies of transfer. For proteins the fit is carried out by considering atoms in five classes: carbon, neutral oxygen and nitrogen (N/0), charged oxygen (0-), charged nitrogen (N+) and sulphur. Then the free energies of the common amino acids can be represented by equations of the type

in which Aa( C) is the ASP for carbon and A( C;, R) is the solvent-accessible surface area of carbon atom i in a standard conformation21 of residue R, and so forth for the other terms.
The o- term describes the charged oxygen atoms in Glu and
Asp; the N+ term describes the charged nitrogen atoms in Lys, Arg and His residues; the N/O term describes all uncharged N and O atoms. In Asp, Glu and Arg the most exposed N or 0 atom is taken to be the atom on which the charge is concentrated. Only certain terms of equation (3) are needed to describe any given residue. For example, Asn requires only C and N/O terms. The pH dependence of charges is ignored, an assumption that might be thought to be poor for His, but the solvent-accessible areas of the N atoms are not large.

The assumption in equation (3) is that 20 residue hydrophobicities (AGR) can be represented by five ASPs (Aas), provided that suitable values of Aa can be found. We now show that a consistent set of Aas can be derived from experimental data on free energies of transfer. The accessible areas A; of residues in standard conformations can be calculated from known structures; we have adopted the areas calculated by Shrake and Rupley21 , which are close to those found by C. Chothia (personal communication); they are for the amino acid X in a Gly-X-Gly sequence in a typical extended conformation. The values of the Aas were determined by a linear least-squares fit of equations (3) to observed values for the free energy of

The quality of the fit is illustrated in Fig. 2, and the observed and calculated values are given in Table 1. The fit is generally good except for Lys and Cys. Note that the non-polar atoms C and S increase the free energy of the system as they are transferred from the interior of the protein to water. Polar atoms decrease the free energy in the same process; charged atoms cause a much larger decrease.

in which A is the solvent-accessible surface area of an atom in the folded state and A' is that in the reference state21 . In the usual way in which equation (4) is used, the reference state does not matter because the energies of the same polypeptide chain are compared in two conformations having a common reference state. This is true for the application described below.

Improperly folded structures
One potential use of equation (4) is to assess the stabilities of modified or redesigned proteins. To illustrate such a calculation, the models of Novotny et al. 1 for incorrectly folded proteins are useful. These models were generated by exchanging the 113 side chains on the correctly folded a-carbon backbone ofhaemerythrin26 from T. dyscritum with those from the correctly folded, ,13-sheet backbone of an immunoglobulin variable light-chain (VL) domain27 having the same number of residues. Novotny et al. used an energy-minimizing computer program to make small annealing adjustments in coordinates, and to reduce the potential energies of the two incorrectly folded structures to local minima. These annealed structures then had satisfactory van der Waals contacts, with normal valence angles and bond lengths, but no explicit account had been taken of solvation effects. Novotny et al. 1 noted that there is greater exposure of apolar residues in the misfolded structures. To these model misfolded structures, as well as to their energy-annealed, correctly folded analogues, we have applied equation (4) to estimate the solvation contribution to the free energy of folding. Our procedure consists simply of: first, computing22 solvent-accessible atomic areas of the four structures from atomic coordinates; and second, weighting each atomic area by its ASP, and summing.
The solvation free energy is lower for the correct structures (Table 2). Both real structures have solvation free energies lower

Fig. 2 Comparison of experimental values AG085 for free energies of transfer for amino-acid residues with the values of AGR calculated from equation (3), using ASPs determined by linear
least squares. The details of the least-squares fit are as follows: Fauchere and Pliska25 deduced the hydrophobic parameter 1r for 19 amino-acid side chains as the difference between the logarithm
of the measured distribution coefficients of the acetyl amino-acid amides and acetyl-glycine amide. Equation (3) was fitted to the
free energies of transfer, 2.303 RT1r = AG08s, with the aid of NAG
library routines G02BFF and G02CHF (Numerical Algorithms
Group Ltd, Mayfield House, 256 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 7DE,
UK). In this fitting procedure, the difference between AGR and AG08s is minimized by least-squares determination of the ASP values. The values of A for the appropriate atoms in each side chain are taken from ref. 21. For all residues, only the differences
in area with the Gly residue are considered. Thus backbone atoms are ignored, except for the difference in exposed area for the
a-carbon atom of glycine and of the other side chains. The deviation of points of the figure from a straight line can be explained
by any of: (1) errors in measurements of AG08s; (2) inappropriate areas in equation (3); or (3) faulty assumptions in the formulation of equation (3) (see below). The multiple correlation coefficient
R is 0.95, and the value of its square corrected for the number of
parameters (ASPs), R~oR, is 0.88. The R~oR suggests that the
separate ASPs for o- and N+ are justified, as is the sulphur ASP:
with only a single type of charged atom, R~oR falls to 0.85 and
R to 0.93; for only C/S and N/O ASPs, R~oR falls to 0.11 and R to 0.45. Fits to other hydrophobicity scales give different values for the ASPs. For example, the consensus scale of Eisenberg et
al. 12, an average of five scales, yields R = 0.97 for a five-term fit.
The ASP values for the consensus fit are similar to those reported
here, but the o- and N+ ASPs have larger values. Despite the
better fit to the consensus scale, the ASPs based on the data of Fauchere and Pliska25 have been used in our calculations, in part because the absolute level of the consensus scale is unknown and
in part because the new ASPs for the charged atoms seem more reasonable.

than the hypothetical, unfolded reference state by some 100 kcal mol- 1, -1 kcal per residue. Moreover, the solvation free energies for the real structures are markedly lower than for the incorrectly folded ones. Not only does each correctly folded structure have lower solvation free energy than the same polypeptide sequence folded improperly, but also each correct structure has lower free energy than the other sequence folded with the same backbone pattern. These results can be contrasted with the behaviour of traditional energy terms1, which are not significantly different in the folded and misfolded structures.
When contributions to the solvation energy of folding for the natural structures are examined, interesting details emerge. For example, in the haemerythrin structure, 95 of the 113 side chains stabilize the solvation energy. Only one side chain, Asp 11, is destabilizing by so much as 1 kcal mol- 1. For this side chain, both oxygen atoms are somewhat shielded from solvent relative to the extended reference structure. But for the protein as a whole, the process of folding from the extended reference state

respec-

tively. Significant contributions to the stability of the folded

state come from the apolar carbon atoms of the 29 Lys, Arg,

Asp and Glu residues (a total of 41 kcal mol- 1). These contribu-

tions would be obscured or neglected in energetic models that

are cast in terms of whole residue hydrophobicities; clearly,

whole-residue hydrophobicities cannot account adequately for

the folding energies of proteins.

Agreement with experimental data

Although it is reassuring that the estimated free energy of folding

is lower for the real protein structures than for the incorrectly

folded chains, this result falls well short of experimental

verification of the method proposed here. Here we examine its

assumptions and compare its predictions with experiment.

The principal assumption in the use of equation (3) to derive

the ASPs is that the free energy of transfer is a linear function

ofthe accessible areas ofthe constitutent atoms ofthe transferred

molecule. This assumption is supported indirectly by the

observed linearity of free energy with surface area for the transfer

of many compounds from various non-aqueous liquids into

This is not a new idea. Cohn and Edsall17 made a critical analysis

of evidence which suggested that the free energy of transfer of

a chemical group such as -CH2-, from ethanol and other apolar solvents to water is often independent of the molecule in which

it is found. Some values for the free energy of transfer for various

groups as compiled by Cohn and Edsall are given in Table 1,

where they are compared with our new values calculated from

equation (3). Generally, the computed values agree well in sign

and magnitude with the experimental values, especially con-

sidering the diversity of the groups considered. The calculated

values for side-chain transfers are also in reasonable agreement

with the well-known measured values of Nozaki and Tanford9

(Table 1). An exception to agreement in Table 1 is the free

energy of transfer of the glycyl residue, for which equation (3)

gives the wrong sign. This is probably because our model takes

virtually no account of the partial charges on the amide N and

0 atoms. The reason is that the backbone atoms are omitted in

the fitting procedure used to determine the ASPs, because the

data being fitted are all differences between acetyl glycyl amide

and the corresponding derivative of other amino acids. From

the value in Table 2 for the free energy of transfer of the glycyl

residue from ethanol to water, it is possible to estimate a crude

value for the ASP for the amide N and O atoms at - - 50 cal

A-2 mol- 1• If this value is qualitatively correct, then our solva-
tion energies of folding are somewhat overestimated. To resolve this uncertainty, it will be necessary to fit a larger database of comparable free energies of transfer, which is not yet available.
An additional assumption in the use of equation (4) is that a non-polar liquid is an adequate model for the interior of a protein, as the ASPs derived from transfers between liquids are applied by equation (4) to transfer from liquid to protein interior. This assumption has been examined by Richards24, who also considered amino-acid crystals as models for the protein interior. Richards concluded that an ASP somewhere in the range of
13-26 cal A- 2 mol- 1 is appropriate for the transfer of apolar atoms. Our .:ia(C) and .:ia(S) values of 16 and 21 cal A-2 mol- 1
lie in this range, but may deserve revision as further free-energy data become available. The value for .:ia(S), resting on only two measurements, is particularly subject to revision.

Atomic hydrophobic moments

In earlier work we described the amphiphilicity (asymmetry of

hydrophobicity) of segments of regular protein secondary structure in terms of hydrophobic moments32. It was found that the

hydrophobic dipole moments of neighbouring segments of

secondary structure tend to oppose each other in correctly folded proteins12, but not in incorrectly folded ones33, and that hydro-

phobic moments can be used to classify helices on the basis of

amino-acid

sequences

and

These

applications of hydrophobic moments were all formulated in

terms of residue moments and can perhaps be made more precise

with atomic-level moments.

The hydrophobic moment can be defined as an atomic

property using the ASP values determined here. The hydro-

phobic dipole moment of a group of atoms is given by a sum

over atoms i

atoms i

(5)
atomsi

in which ri is a vector from any origin to the position of atom i, and where the brackets indicate the mean value for all atoms of the' group. The second term ensures that the value of µa is independent of the choice of origin. When the sum in equation (5) is restricted to the atoms in a single side chain, a residue hydrophobic dipole moment is defined. This quantity is a measure of the amphiphilicity of the side chain, as distinct from its hydrophobicity. The values of these moments are tabulated in Table 1.
From these values it is apparent that the residues of greatest intrinsic amphiphilicity are Arg, Lys and Glu. In contrast, the most hydrophobic residues, Trp, Phe, Leu and Ile, all have small amphiphilicities. The direction of the hydrophobic moment is also defined by equation (5). This is expressed in Table 1 as the cosine of the angle between the direction of the moment and the direction of the vector from the a carbon to the side-chain centre. For the highly arnphiphilic residues, the direction of the moment is nearly antiparallel to the a-carbon side-chain vector (cos 0 near to -1). This is illustrated in Fig. 1b for Arg. Some of the most hydrophobic side chains (for example, Ile, Met and Phe) have moments nearly parallel to the a-carbon-centre vector
(cos 0 near to +1). Note that when the phenolic oxygen (with
negative .:la) is added to Phe to form Tyr, it reverses the direction of the moment (from +0.92 to -0.93).

Implications and extensions
How does the solvation free energy defined in equation (4) correspond to the component of the free energy of protein folding first described by Kauzmann as hydrophobic3? Kauzmann suggested that exposed apolar side chains increase the free energy of the system because they decrease the entropy of water. This effect on the free energy is described in equation (4) by the terms .:ia(C) and .:ia(S). Kauzmann's approach is extended in equation (4) by including the terms .:ia(N/0),

~IT(O-) and ~IT(N+). This has been done to introduce information from empirical free-energy measurements in a selfconsistent way, and to impose a penalty in free energy for burial of charged and polar groups with a magnitude determined from experiments. These terms probably include contributions from electrostatic38 and hydrogen-bonding effects as well. A full understanding ofthese contributions would require a knowledge of the structure of the molecules used to derive the ASPs, including states of protonation and hydration in both solvents. In short, ~Gs includes contributions to the free energy of folding that go beyond the entropy change of the solvent. For this reason we call this energy the solvation free energy, rather than the hydrophobic free energy.
One use of equation (4) is in assessing the stability of proposed new proteins. These can either be genetically redesigned proteins or proteins designed for peptide synthesis. The energy of any model described in atomic coordinates can be tested against equation (4), although it may be necessary to supplement this equation with terms for other components of the folding energy. Another use is in energy-coupled X-ray phase refinement of protein structures39- 42• In existing procedures, a model is deter-
mined that is the best compromise between the potential energy

of the structure and the fit to the X-ray data. These methods do not go far enough in that it is the free energy, including solvation effects, that determines the structure. These effects could be incorporated by using ASPs as suggested here, along with the analytical method of Richmond23, for computing accessible surface areas and their spatial derivatives. Similarly, the addition of a solvation energy term of the form of equation (4) could be made to molecular dynamics calculations. Finally, we note that the general method of computing solvation energy expressed in equation (4) could be developed further to compute the solvation contribution to the free energy for association of proteins with membranes or nucleic acids.

Inadequacy of Coulomb's friction law for particle assemblies
K. Kendall
!Cl New Science Group, PO Box 11, The Heath, Runcorn, Cheshire WA7 4QE, UK

Wherever powders are manipulated by mechanical means, adhesive

and frictional forces act between the solid grains. For two centuries,

these

forces

have

been

described

by

Coulomb's

law

1 ,

a

law

which

originally proved useful in designing civil engineering structures,

and which has since been profitably extended to the understanding of the powder flows in chemical plants2• However, we have now

found that Coulomb's law is not adequate to explain the compac-

tion of fine powders in the manufacture of ceramic articles, where

it has been observed that friction appears to increase for smaller

particles. This apparent increase in friction is explained by con-

sidering in detail the contact of loaded, adhesive, elastic spheres.

Consider the ideal experiment (Fig. la) in which a bed of

particles is loaded onto and sheared along a polished plate of the same material3 • The nominal shear stress F/ A (where F is

force and A is area) required to slide the powder across the plate under the normal stress W / A (where Wis normal load) has usually been interpreted by Coulomb's law:

F/A=K+µ,W/A

(1)

where K represents the cohesive shear strength of the particle/plate assembly (that is, the shear stress experienced at zero normal load) and µ, is the coefficient of friction between the surfaces4 • This law, in combination with the geometrical constraints on powder motion first mentioned by Reynolds in 1885, has been much used to describe the deformation of powders and soils in complex stress states5- 7• Here we demonstrate that equation (1) does not follow the experimental results satisfactorily, and we propose a new argument which provides an improved fit to the observed behaviour.
The problem of applying Coulomb's law to assemblies of fine particles is that the friction coefficient calculated from equation (1) does not generally match that measured in a standard friction test between macroscopic blocks ofmaterial. First, the calculated µ, is often higher than expected: for example, sand particles of
diameter 0.5 mm in water give µ, =0.45 whereas two large quartz
blocks give µ, = 0.3 (Fig. 1b ). A second difficulty is that the friction coefficient increases as the grains are made smaller,
