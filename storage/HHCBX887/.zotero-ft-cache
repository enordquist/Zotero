ABSTRACT The heat shock response and the heat shock proteins have been conserved across evolution. In Escherichia
coi, the heat shock response is positively regulated by the or32
transcriptional factor and negatively regulated by a subset of the heat shock proteins themselves. In an effort to understand the regulation of the heat shock response, we have purified the a32 polypeptide to homogeneity. During the purification procedure, we found that a large fraction of the overexpressed a32 polypeptide copurifled with the universally conserved DoaK heat shock protein (the prokaryotic equivalent of the 70-kDa heat shock protein, HSP70). Further experiments established that purified a32 bound to DnaK and that this complex was disrupted in the presence of ATP. Consistent with the fact that dnaK756 mutant bacteria overexpress heat shock proteins at all temperatures, purified DnaK756 mutant protein did not appreciably bind to C32
All organisms respond to environmental stresses, such as heat and ethanol, by a rapid, vigorous, and transient acceleration in the rate of synthesis of a group of proteins collectively called the heat shock proteins (HSPs) (for reviews see refs. 1-4). Many of these HSPs have been conserved across evolution. For example, the DnaK and GroEL proteins of Escherichia coli are -50% identical, at the amino acid sequence level, to the eukaryotic HSP70 and HSP60 homologues (4), respectively. The dnaJ gene is another example of a heat shock gene that is highly conserved in evolution (5-8).
E. coli has -20 heat shock genes whose expression is positively regulated by the ac32 polypeptide [the rpoH (htpR) gene product] at the transcriptional level. a32 is extremely unstable in vivo, with a half-life of =1 min at normal temperatures (9-11). In addition, the heat shock response of E. coli is negatively autoregulated. Specifically, mutations in either the dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE heat shock gene can lead to an overproduction of HSPs (10, 12, 13). Such overexpression of the heat shock response is due in part to a stabilization of the a-32 polypeptide in such genetic backgrounds (10, 11).
DnaK can bind to other polypeptides, such as GrpE, AP, p53, staphylococcal A protein, and unfolded bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (14-19). Such binding is disrupted in the presence of hydrolyzable ATP. In addition, overproduction of DnaK aids the export of an otherwise export-deficient MalB-LacZ hybrid protein (20). DnaK, also referred to as a "chaperone" (21), is capable of promiscuously binding to various unfolded polypeptides, allowing them to (i) maintain the unfolded form and thus prevent misfolding, (ii) traverse biological membranes, (iii) be protected from aggregation or denaturation under conditions of stress, and (iv) be disaggregated when damaged by stress (reviewed in refs. 4, 22, and 23).
The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment. This article must therefore be hereby marked "advertisement" in accordance with 18 U.S.C. §1734 solely to indicate this fact.

DnaJ and GrpE can function synergistically with DnaKe.g., in the replication of bacteriophages A and P1 (24-26). In addition, the ATPase activity of DnaK is greatly stimulated in the presence of both GrpE and DnaJ (18). Thus, at least part of the biological role of DnaJ and GrpE would be to facilitate the efficient "recycling" of DnaK (18).
Skelly et al. (27) showed that a small fraction of purified Ea70 and Ea32 RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme preparations was associated with DnaK, even after extensive purification. No specific function has been assigned to this putative DnaK-RNAP interaction. It could be that a small fraction of the RNAP molecules are in an aggregated form. Since DnaK can disaggregate such RNAP aggregates (23), it could associate with them during the purification procedure.
In this work we purified o 32 polypeptide to homogeneity and demonstrated that wild-type DnaK, but not DnaK756 mutant protein, could bind to a32 polypeptide in vitro. Such a DnaK-&2 association could potentially serve to negatively modulate heat shock gene expression either by sequestering ao32, thus preventing it from binding to the RNAP core and
forming Eo-32 holoenzyme, by actively stripping &,32 from Ea2 (28), or by accelerating degradation of a, by presenting
it to various proteases (3, 29). These possibilities are not mutually exclusive.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of an Inducible rpoH-Containing Plasmid. To obtain a stable plasmid construct that overproduced the a2 polypeptide, the 1.3-kilobase (kb) EcoRV fragment from plasmid pFN97 (30) was cloned into the Sma I site of pTTQ18 (30, 31), to give rise to pTPG2. All known rpoH promoters have been removed in pTPG2 as a consequence ofthe cloning
procedure. pTPG2 carries a lacIQ gene, whose product binds
to the upstream region and silences the expression of the cloned rpoH gene. Addition of isopropyl 8-D-thiogalactopy-
ranoside (IPTG) leads to Lacd repressor inactivation and
initiation of rpoH gene transcription. Purification of a32. E. coli bacteria carrying pTPG2 were
grown at 300C to a density of =5 x 101 cells per ml in L broth (13) supplemented with ampicillin (50 pug/ml). At this point
IPTG was added (1 mM) and growth was allowed to proceed for 1 hr. The 10-liter culture was harvested by centrifugation
at 00C in a Beckman JA-10 rotor for 15 min at 6000 rpm. The
bacterial pellet was resuspended in 80 ml of buffer A [50 mM
Tris HCl pH 7.2/10%o (wt/vol) sucrose/2 mM EDTA/1 mM
dithiothreitol/230 mM NaCl/0.1% lysozyme/0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. After a 30-min incubation on ice, sodium deoxycholate was added to a concentration of 0.05%, and the bacteria were lysed by sonication (three times for 0.5

min at 70 W) at 0C. The lysate centrifuged in a Beckman type 35 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 90 min at 00C. Proteins were precipitated from the supernatant by ammonium sulfate (0.35
g/ml). The pellet was dialyzed for 16 hr against buffer B [50
mM Tris HCI, pH 7.2/12 mM 2-mercaptoethanol/10%o (vol/ vol) glycerol/50 mM NaCl/0.5 mM EDTA] and loaded onto
a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, 2.6 x 6.5 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of 50-400 mM NaCl in buffer B. Fractions containing &J32, asjudged by Western blot analysis (32) using anti-a,32 serum (generously provided by Herbert Weissbach, Hoffman-La Roche), were pooled and precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate (0.35 g/ml). The pellet was dialyzed for 12 hr against buffer C [10 mM imidazole, pH 7.0/10% (wt/vol) sucrose/0.5 mM EDTA/5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol] with 100 mM NaCl and was loaded onto a heparin-agarose column (Sigma, 1 x 6 cm). Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 100-700 mM NaCl in buffer C. The (r32 protein was found in two peaks. The first was eluted at -300 mM NaCl, probably through its interaction with DnaK (see Fig. 2 and text). The second peak of o.32 was at -420 mM NaCI. Further purification was carried out only with material from the second peak. Fractions containing o.32 were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C with 50 mM NaCI and were loaded onto a P11 column (Whatman, 1.5 x 3 cm). The adsorbed proteins were eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 50-500 mM NaCl in buffer C. Fractions containing the most pure o.32 (as judged by SDS/PAGE and Coomassie blue staining), which was eluted at the beginning of the gradient, were pooled and applied directly to a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad, 0.9 x 1.5 cm) equilibrated with buffer D [20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8/100 mM NaCI/10o (wt/vol) sucrose/1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol]. Adsorbed proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 20-200 mM potassium phosphate in buffer D. Fractions containing pure a32 were pooled and dialyzed against buffer E [40 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6/10o (vol/vol) glycerol/0.1 mM EDTA/100 mM NaCI/1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol] and frozen in liquid nitrogen. v.32 activity is stable at -70°C for at least 6 months and can withstand repeated freezing and thawing.
Purification of Other Enzymes. DnaK and DnaK756 proteins (14) and RNAP core and o-70 (33) were purified as
described. The purity of all enzymes used was >90%o, except for a-70 (-70%).
In Vitro Transcription. Run-off transcription experiments were performed (34) with NaCl at 160 mM. The transcriptional activity of the a32 protein in each fraction following filtration and glycerol gradient centrifugation experiments was measured by using pCG1 DNA, which carries an intact dnaK gene (13), as a template. The 25-,ul reaction mixtures contained 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCI2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 200 mM NaCI, 0.16 mM each NTP (and 1 ,Ci of [3H]UTP; Amersham; 1 ,uCi = 37 kBq), 1 ,ug of pCG1 DNA, 2.8 ,ug of RNAP core, and aliquots from each fraction. Reaction mixtures Were incubated for 10 min at 37°C and the reaction was stopped as described by Chamberlin et al. (35).
[3H]UMP incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was estimated by liquid scintillation (35).
Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation. Reaction mixtures (100,ul) in buffer E (with 1 mM dithiothreitol instead of 2-mercaptoethanol) were assembled on ice, the order of addition of the proteins being 32, ao70, DnaK, and finally RNAP core. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37°C, and then loaded directly onto a 3.2-ml linear 15-35% (vol/vol) glycerol gradient and centrifuged at 2°C in a Beckman SW60 rotor for
25 hr at 48,000 rpm. Fractions were collected from the bottom
of the tube and analyzed for transcriptional activity. The experiments of Fig. 5 were done with a linear 15-40% glycerol gradient, with centrifugation for 20 hr.

Size Chromatography. A P-200 column (Bio-Rad, 0.5 x 8 cm) was equilibrated with buffer F (40 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6/100 mM NaCI/5 mM MgCl2/1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol/ 0.02% Triton-X100) and 1 mM ATP, where indicated. Reac-
tion mixtures (=70 pAl) containing the above-described pro-
teins in buffer F were incubated for 10 min at 370C and then loaded onto the P-200 column. Fractions of four drops each (=100 Al) were collected. The presence ofa&32 in each fraction was monitored by the transcription assay and by SDS/PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining.

RESULTS
Purification of o"32P. To investigate the mechanism of heat shock regulation, we purified the a-32 polypeptide. Up until this work, a,32 had been obtained by first purifying E&32 holoenzyme, separating the subunits by SDS/PAGE, removing the a,32 band, and renaturing it (34, 36). The rpoH gene was cloned under a strong inducible promoter, because overproduction of &32 is not tolerated well by E. coli (11). o.32 was overproduced following IPTG induction and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1A).
Purified 32 Is Transcriptionafly Active. To show that the purified a32 was active in heat shock promoter recognition, in vitro run-off transcription experiments were performed. The Nru I-Pvu I DNA fragment containing both the P1 and P2 heat shock promoters of dnaK (38) was used as template. When only RNAP core was present, no significant transcription was obtained (Fig. 1B). Addition of purified o.32 allowed the reconstituted Ec32 holoenzyme to initiate transcription at the appropriate sites, as judged by the length of the two run-offtranscripts. Similar to the results of Cowing et al. (38), no transcription from the putative P3 heat shock promoter was observed.
DnaK Copurffies with cr32. We observed an interaction between &J32 and DnaK during the purification of a&32. After elution of proteins from the heparin-agarose column or32 was

found in two regions of the gradient (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis using both anti-a-32 and anti-DnaK antibodies
showed that one region matched the peak of DnaK (300 mM NaCl) (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The DnaK/&32 stoichi-
ometry was not established at this point, because a protein
similar in size to DnaK was present in fractions 1-3, and
because it is difficult to quantitate with the staining and
Western blotting procedures. The fact that in the absence of a'32 overproduction, DnaK is found exclusively in the void
volume of the heparin-agarose column argues against a
coincidental coelution of the two proteins. In agreement with this, the bulk of DnaK from the fractions loaded onto the
heparin column was also found in the excluded volume. When o-32 was overproduced and purified from isogenic
dnaK7S6 mutant bacteria, <5% of either the a-32 or the
DnaK756 protein was eluted at the first peak position (data
not shown). This result also supports the conclusion that the DnaK-_32 interaction is not fortuitous and that the interac-
tion changes the chromatographic properties of both proteins
in the heparin-agarose column. To further confirm that authentic a-32 was present in both
peaks, the Mr 32,000 polypeptides were sequenced. In both
instances the same N-terminal sequence (Thr-Asp-Lys-MetGlu) was found, matching perfectly the one predicted by the DNA sequence (the first methionine being processed). Additionally, the transcriptional specific activities (see below), as well as the isoelectric points of the a32 found in the two peaks, were identical (data not shown), suggesting that the two a-32 species were the same polypeptide.
DnaK and cr32 Form a Physical Complex. To determine whether DnaK and a-32 directly interact with each other, gel filtration and glycerol gradient centrifugation were performed. First, the two purified proteins were incubated together for 10 min at 370C and then filtered on a small P-200 column. The presence of a-32 in the various fractions was monitored by the transcription assay and by SDS/PAGE. In all cases the position of the activity coincided perfectly with the position of a32. In addition, DnaK, at the levels used, did

not significantly influence the a32 transcriptional activity (data not shown).
The a-32 polypeptide alone was eluted in fractions 9-12 (Fig. 3). However, when a-32 was incubated with DnaK (1:2.6 molar ratio), it was eluted in fractions 5-8, indicating its presence in a larger complex. From its activity in the transcription assay, and its physical presence following SDS/ PAGE, >80% of a-32 was found in a complex with DnaK (Fig. 3). When the DnaK-a-32 interaction was monitored in the presence of 1 mM ATP, a-32 was eluted in fractions 7-11, clearly an intermediate position between that of free a-32 and the DnaK-a32 complex. Although the reasons for this chromatographic behavior are not known, an analogous result was observed for the DnaK-AP interaction in the presence or absence of ATP (figure 3B of ref. 17). One possibility is that continuous cycles of releasing and rebinding a32 or AP by DnaK result in the observed intermediate position.
Equivalent results were obtained from glycerol gradient sedimentation. Even under such conditions, known to interfere with hydrophobic interactions, =40%o of the a-32 activity was found in a complex with DnaK (Fig. 4). However, when ATP was present throughout the gradient, the DnaK-a32 complex was not observed (Fig. 4).
The DnaK-a32 interaction was also monitored by the ability of anti-DnaK antibodies to coprecipitate a-32. Addition of RNAP core to the a-32/DnaK incubation mixture abolished the coprecipitation of a32 and DnaK (data not shown; see below).
DnaK756 and G-32 Do Not Form a Detectable Complex. dnaK7S6 mutant bacteria overproduce HSPs at all temperatures tested and, in addition, fail to turn off the heat shock response at high temperatures (12). The DnaK756 mutant protein was purified and its association with a-32 was tested as described above. With both methods, no interaction whatsoever was observed between the two proteins (Figs. 3 and 4). We conclude that if an interaction between a-32 and DnaK756 exists, it must be unstable.
Competition Experiments with RNAP Core. Since a-32 interacts with both DnaK and the RNAP core, we performed experiments to determine the relative affinities of a-32 for either DnaK or RNAP core. Purified a-32 was incubated with either RNAP core, DnaK, or both for 10 min at 370C. The interaction of ar32 with the other proteins was monitored by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The position of a-32 was

established by the Western blot technique using 125I-labeled staphylococcal A protein. Under such conditions, RNAP core has a much higher affinity for a-32 than does DnaK (Fig. 5). Even in the presence of an 8-fold molar excess of DnaK, we were unable to detect an appreciable DnaK-a32 complex in the presence of RNAP core. However, when the a-32 and DnaK proteins were preincubated for 20 min at 42TC, and then RNAP core was added, a small amount of a-32 was found
to still associate with DnaK (5-1o of total a-32; data not
shown). Because of the potential antagonistic roles of a-32 and the
"housekeeping" a-70 polypeptide in the regulation of the heat shock response, we also determined their relative affinities for the RNAP core enzyme. When both a-32 and a-70 (1:1 molar ratio) were present in the reaction, -4Wo of a-32 was found in a complex with RNAP core (Fig. 5). When DnaK was also added to the reaction mixture, the free a-32 was found in a DnaK3-a32 complex (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained

when the o.70/o.32 competition was monitored through the ability of RNAP-a32 holoenzyme to initiate transcription at the dnaK heat shock promoters. When a 70 was preincubated
in equimolar amounts to a&32 with RNAP core, the transcrip-
tion from the dnaK promoters was limited to 30% of the control (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The classic heat shock response in E. coli is under the positive transcriptional regulation of the a,32 polypeptide and the negative regulation of the HSPs themselves (reviewed in refs. 1, 3, and 28). Expression of rpoH (htpR), coding for a-32, is regulated by a variety of intricate transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms (3). The transcriptional mechanisms include the presence of multiple promoters, which are regulated by temperature, state of supercoiling, catabolite state, and the DnaA DNA replication initiation protein of E. coli (3, 39-43). Posttranslational regulation includes cis-acting mRNA sites, which impede translation at low temperatures (44), as well as the extremely short half-life
of a-32 (9-11). The half-life of a-32 is increased in dnaK-, dnaJ-, or grpE- genetic backgrounds, consistent with the
fact that these mutations lead to an overproduction of HSPs (10-13). A possibility is that the a-32 polypeptide is a better substrate for proteases when complexed with DnaK protein (29). All of the above factors probably act synergistically to limit the intracellular level of a-32 to 10-30 copies per cell (45).
DnaK has been purified to homogeneity and has been shown to possess a number of interesting properties: (i) a very weak ATPase activity (46); (ii) an autophosphorylating activity (46); (iii) the ability to bind other proteins, including AO, AP, GrpE, and unfolded bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (14, 17, 19, 28); (iv) the ability to protect RNAP-a32 holoenzyme from heat inactivation (23); (v) the ability to disaggregate certain protein aggregates, such as RNAP (23), DnaA (47), and the multiprotein complex assembled at the origin of A DNA replication (24, 48); (vi) the ability to suppress, when overproduced, the transport defect of a mutant LamB-LacZ hybrid polypeptide (20); (vii) the ability to disaggregate, with the help of DnaJ, RepA dimers into monomers (49); (viii) the ability to undergo a dramatic conformational change upon NTP hydrolysis (19); and (ix) a great stimulation of its ATPase activity in the presence of DnaJ and GrpE (18). These results have led to the following model (4, 28, 43): DnaK can bind promiscuously to many unfolded and some folded polypeptides. Such binding maintains these polypeptides in a form competent for either export across a membrane, proteolysis by some proteases, or proper folding/assembly. The polypeptides are released following ATP hydrolysis. In light of this model, protein disaggregation would result from multiple rounds of such binding and release by DnaK.
The purification of a-32 by classic biochemical techniques enabled us to demonstrate its direct protein-protein interaction with both DnaK and the RNAP core. The DnaK-a32 interaction was observed (a) during a-32 purification, with approximately half of the a-32 population found associated with DnaK, and (b) between the two purified proteins in gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation experiments, with the complex being disrupted in the presence of ATP. That 50% of the overproduced a-32 was found associated with DnaK and not with other major chaperones, such as GroEL, suggests a specific DnaK-a32 interaction. This suggestion is further supported by the failure of the mutant DnaK756 protein to bind purified -32. However, a32 associated with RNAP core much more readily than it did with DnaK; i.e., in the presence of an 8-fold molar excess of DnaK over RNAP core, purified a-32 still quantitatively associated with RNAP. The observation that, during purification, approximately half

of the overproduced 32 protein entered into an association with DnaK suggests that in vivo the 32 polypeptide may not have ready access to the RNAP core, perhaps because of the presence of o.70 and other factors that may associate with the RNAP core.
Our data are consistent with the following heat shock regulation model. At low temperatures, such as 30TC or below, and in the absence of protein-damaging conditions, DnaK binds to and effectively sequesters the majority of the (732 molecules, thus damping the expression of heat shock genes, including dnaK. Since the two major dnaK promoters are transcribed exclusively by o-32 (ref. 38 and this work), its rate of transcription must be exquisitely regulated by the intracellular levels of both v.32 and DnaK. When E. coli undergoes a heat shock or encounters a protein-damaging agent, the levels of denatured, unfolded, and aggregated proteins increase. DnaK binds to such polypeptides, thus protecting them from further damage or disaggregating some of them (23). This leaves cr32 free to associate with RNAP core, leading to an increase in heat shock gene expression. When the level of damaged proteins subsides and/or the intracellular level of DnaK rises due to its accelerated rate of synthesis, the DnaK protein can resume its &r32-sequestering "chores," thus interfering with its access to RNAP core and accelerating its destruction by proteases. The resumed DnaK-32 interaction will again result in damping of heat shock gene expression.
The demonstrated DnaK-32 interaction also helps explain the down-regulation of the heat shock response at low temperatures (50); when bacteria undergoing a heat shock response at 42TC are shifted back to 30'C, the expression of the heat shock response is transiently repressed. The excess DnaK protein synthesized at 420C will be free to efficiently sequester the excess cr32 polypeptide at 300C, thus damping the heat shock response. It would not be surprising to find that eukaryotes have evolved a similar HSC70/HSP70 "sequestration" mechanism of the heat shock factor (HSF) in order to autoregulate their heat shock response (45).
