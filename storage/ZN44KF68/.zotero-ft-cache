Structural insights into substrate binding by the molecular chaperone DnaK

The 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family of molecular chaperones participates in a variety of biological processes including protein folding, disruption and rescue of protein aggregates, modulation of the heat shock response and protein translocation across membranes (for a recent review see ref. 1).

The Hsp70 proteins consist of a 44 kDa nucleotide binding

Despite the overall similar fold, there are several very significant differences between the structure of the apo β-domain and the structures of this domain with the binding site occupied3–5. These structural differences are localized primarily in the C-terminal half of strand β3 and in the loop regions (Fig. 2a–d). Particularly noteworthy is the shift observed for loop L3,4 and, to a smaller extent, for loop L1,2, where the side chains of Thr 428, Ala 429, and Met 404 protrude to partially occlude the space that is taken up by the substrate in the peptide-bound structures of DnaK (Fig. 2e). In the crystal structure3 of DnaK(389–607) and in the solution structure4 of DnaK(386–561), the region Gln 424– Ser 427 of strand β3 is an integral part of the lower β-sheet and is hydrogen bonded to strand β6 (Fig. 2c,d). Here, no characteristic cross strand NOEs can be found for these residues, indicating that this part of the sheet is not formed. Intriguingly, the regions with large structural differences are also characterized by extensive line broadening of their 1HN resonances (Fig. 3). This broadening is most dramatic for residues in the regions of Gln 424, Val 425, Phe 426 and Ser 427, and for the amide protons of Gly 405, Thr 417 and Ile 418, which have completely disappeared from the amide proton detected NMR spectra. The 1HN line broadening is much more severe at 800 MHz than at 500 MHz; moreover, the resonances become narrower at higher temperatures. We therefore conclude that the broadening arises from intermediate exchange among multiple conformations at the millisecond–microsecond time scale. The conformational flexibility of apo β-domain is not restricted to the substrate binding cleft, but extends to loop L2,3, which is remote from both the cleft and the α-helical domain (Fig. 3).
One might attribute the observed structural changes and conformational flexibility to a destabilizing effect caused by the removal of the helical region. However, the chemical shift dispersion in the 15N HSQC spectrum is identical to that of well-folded constructs that contain part of the helical domain4,5. Furthermore, the spectrum does not change noticeably between 15 and 45 °C. The construct precipitates quantitatively between 45 and 50 °C, a temperature close to the 55.6 °C transition assigned to the thermal unfolding of the substrate binding domain in wtDnaK14, suggesting that the isolated β-domain folds with similar stability.
Peptide binding to apo β-domain monitored by NMR Titration of 15N/13C labeled apo β-domain with the peptide NRLLLTG3,12,15 was followed with 15N,1H and 13C,1H correlation spectroscopy (Fig. 4). Upon addition of the peptide, new crosspeaks appear at the expense of those assigned to the apo β-domain, indicating that the kinetics of binding are slow on the chemical shift time scale. By quantifying the intensity changes of the NMR resonances corresponding to either the apo β-domain or the peptide-bound β-domain in the titration, we estimate a Kd of 600 ± 200 µM for the NRLLLTG–β-domain complex. This binding is substantially weaker than that reported for the binding of this peptide to wtDnaK in the presence of ATP (43 µM)12. Interestingly, despite the 15-fold weaker binding, the rate constants for association and dissociation of NRLLLTG to DnaK(393–507) are of the same order of magnitude as the values for binding of this peptide to wtDnaK in the presence of ATP12. The lack of line broadening for any of the NMR crosspeaks corresponding to either apo or peptide-bound β-domain throughout the entire titration allowed us to estimate an upper limit of 2 × 104 M-1 s-1 for the bimolecular association rate constant, which in combination with the measured Kd yields 12.5 s-1 for the dissociation rate constant (see Methods). By comparison,

A cylinder was drawn through the Cα positions, and the thickness of the cylindrical rod is proportional to the mean of the global displacement of the 20 energy-minimized DYANA conformations, calculated after superimposing all heavy atoms of the β-strands to minimize r.m.s. deviations. The color code represents the differences in 1HN line width (∆LW) in spectra measured at 800 MHz and 500 MHz proton frequencies. The color code used is: |∆LW| < 5 Hz, white; 5 Hz < |∆LW| < 10 Hz, yellow; |∆LW| > 10 Hz, orange. In red are residues that are exchange-broadened beyond detection and do not exhibit crosspeaks in absence of peptide.
binding of acrylodan-NRLLLTG to wtDnaK–ATP is characterized by a bimolecular association rate constant of 1 × 105 M-1s-1 and a dissociation rate constant of 4.5 s-1 (ref. 12).
Loss of binding affinity of the β-domain could be a consequence of either removal of the helical lid or absence of the ATPase domain. The latter is consistent with the finding that DnaK(1–507) bound to ATP displays a higher affinity for peptide (37 µM) than does the isolated β-domain DnaK(393–507) (600 µM). However, the entire C-terminal domain (384–638) binds NRLLLTG tightly, with a Kd of 11 µM16 (midway between the Kd for binding of peptide to wtDnaK in the absence (0.2 µM)12 and presence of ATP), arguing that it is not the lack of the ATPase domain that compromised the β-domain binding affinity. Since the affinity of the entire C-terminal domain is still considerably tighter than that of the β-domain DnaK(393–507), it is possible that residues 384–393 influence peptide binding affinity in the absence of the ATPase domain. This conserved linker region may play a structural or allosteric role in influencing access to the peptide binding cleft in the substrate binding domain. Supporting this role are recently reported results of mutations in this region, in which allosteric defects were noted17.
Changes in the β-domain NMR spectra upon saturation with peptide suggest that the conformational exchange in the apo β-domain of the protein is caused by the lack of substrate, and not by the lack of the α-helical domain. The 15N,1H correlation spectrum of the apo β-domain becomes devoid of excess line broadening, and the 1HN resonances for the C-terminus of strand β3 reappear. Large chemical shift changes occur in strand β3 and in loops L1,2, L2,3, L3,4 and L5,6 (Fig. 4a). Similar shifts occurred when a different peptide (KLIGVLCSLFRPK; ref. 18) was added. The final 1HN, 15N, and 13C chemical shifts of the peptide-bound β-domain closely resemble those of the intramolecularly bound substrate binding domain4 (Fig. 4b), with the exception that differences are observed in loops L1,2 and L4,5, which lie at the interface between the α-helical and the β-domains and would therefore be expected to have different local environments. This result indicates that the peptidebound β-domain must closely resemble the previously studied substrate binding domains3,4.
Significantly, chemical shift differences upon complex formation are not limited to the binding site region but also involve residues along strand β3 and loop L2,3 at the N-terminal end of the molecule (Fig. 4d). Together with the aforementioned

dynamics for these regions of the molecule, our results clearly point to a long range influence of peptide binding.
Implications for the allosteric mechanism of DnaK Our data establish that interaction between the α-domain and β-domain is not absolutely required for several of the functions of the DnaK chaperone protein. DnaK(1–507) can support bacteriophage λ propagation in vivo. This truncated construct can bind peptide substrates with a binding affinity only fivefold less than wtDnaK. Furthermore, the addition of ATP lowers the peptide binding affinity by a similar magnitude (100-fold) as occurs for wtDnaK. The ATP-induced modulation of peptide binding affinity indicates that DnaK(1–507) retains allosteric communication. Peptide-induced stimulation of ATPase activity in DnaK(1–507) shows that the allosteric interface is functional in both directions. These data, together with previous observations that partial truncations of the helical domain do not abolish Hsp70 functions8, argue that the

β-domain itself controls a significant portion of the ATPinduced allosteric signal.
We have observed substantial structural changes in the apo β-domain in comparison to the peptide-bound forms, which appear to arise from lack of a bound substrate and not from loss of the helix. Therefore, one may investigate these effects to learn about potential allosterically important conformational changes. A very significant difference between the apo form and substratebound form of the β-domain is found at the C-terminal end of strand β3. In the apo form, it does not participate in β-sheet formation, occludes the substrate binding cleft and exhibits conformational exchange dynamics. In the peptidebound form, these residues shift conformation and participate in the β-sheet as their resonances become narrow and coincide with those of the construct that has this region as a very regular β-sheet (Figs 4b, 2c). In addition, cross strand NOEs between β3 and β6 are observed for these residues in the peptide-bound form (S.Y.S., M.P. and E.R.P.Z., unpublished results). As strand β3 (Thr 420-Lys 421-His 422-Ser 423-Gln 424-Val 425-Phe 426Ser 427) does not possess a strong propensity to adopt a β-structure19, it is tempting to speculate that this region serves as a conformational switch. Our observations also indicate that peptide binding induces structural and dynamic changes that are propagated from the binding cleft towards loop L2,3. Conversely, substrate binding properties could then be modulated through long range effects that originate from structural adjustments in the area of loop L2,3.
It is very interesting to note that several mutations that affect the allosteric function of DnaK have been mapped to the same loop L2,3 region (residues 410–420). The DnaK mutant K414I cannot support λ replication in vivo and also shows an absence of allosteric functions in vitro9. In addition, proteolytic cleavage at Lys 414 in DnaK is much more pronounced in the ATP state than in the ADP state, implicating this site in nucleotide-induced conformational changes16. Two recent studies20,21 reported that

The lifetime τfree can then be used to obtain the bimolecular on-rate kon from the equation 1/τfree = kon[L]. The free ligand concentration [L] is easily calculated from the experimental conditions and the measured Kd. Our data leads to a maximum kon of 2 x 104 M-1s-1. From this, and the Kd, we obtain an upper limit of 12.5 s-1 for koff.

Here we report the first three-dimensional structure of a phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase. PRPP is an essential intermediate in several biosynthetic pathways. Structures of the Bacillus subtilis PRPP synthetase in complex with analogs of the activator phosphate and the allosteric inhibitor ADP show that the functional form of the enzyme is a hexamer. The individual subunits fold into two domains, both of which resemble the type I phosphoribosyltransfereases. The active site is located between the two domains and includes residues from two subunits. Phosphate and ADP bind to the same regulatory site consisting of residues from three subunits of the hexamer. In addition to identifying residues important for binding substrates and effectors, the structures suggest a novel mode of allosteric regulation.

Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase, catalyzing the reaction of ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) with ATP to yield PRPP (5-phosphoribosyl-α-1-pyrophosphate) and AMP, links the pentose phosphate pathway to the pyrimidine and purine nucleotide de novo and salvage pathways, the biosynthesis of histidine and tryptophan, and pyridine nucleotide coenzymes1,2. As PRPP is a metabolite required at all times in the cell, the function of PRPP synthetases is central to life. The family of PRPP synthetases includes sequences from 19 organisms (Fig. 1). Detailed kinetic3–9 and structure-function10–13 studies have been performed with some of these enzymes. Among the more salient features reported are their requirement for inorganic phosphate (Pi) and free Mg2+ ions as activators3,9,13–16, their allosteric behavior7,13,17, their complex quaternary structure13,18, their reaction mechanism19, and identification of residues at their active sites8,10–12,20.
ADP is generally the most potent inhibitor of PRPP synthetases7,13,16,17,21. Regulation by ADP can be either competitive or allosteric in nature, but allostery is only observed at saturating concentrations of R5P. Regulation of PRPP synthetases by Pi is also complex as it has multiple effects on their activity and structure18. Pi can be either stimulatory or inhibitory, depending on concentration and the presence of substrates and effectors13,22,23. Although sequence similarity is high within the PRPP synthetase family, its members have no striking overall similarity to other proteins. However, a short region of the PRPP binding motif16 shows homology to the type I phosphoribosyltransferases, in which it interacts with PRPP24–26.
Two crystal structures of the PRPP synthetase from Bacillus subtilis were determined to 2.3 Å and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively, from crystals prepared under different conditions (Table 1). In the SO42-–PRPP synthetase structure, sulfate ions
