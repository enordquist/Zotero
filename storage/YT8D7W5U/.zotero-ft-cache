The chaperonin GroEL binds a variety of polypeptides that share no obvious sequence similarity. The precise structural, chemical and dynamic features that are recognised remain largely unknown. Structural models of the complex between GroEL and its co-chaperonin GroES, and of the isolated apical domain of GroEL (minichaperone; residues 191-376) with a 17 residue N-terminal tag show that a linear sequential sequence (extended b-strand) can be bound. We have analysed characteristics of the motifs that bind to GroEL by using af®nity panning of immobilised GroEL minichaperones for a library of bacteriophages that display the fungal cellulose-binding domain of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase I. This protein has seven non-sequential residues in its binding site that form a linear binding motif with similar dimensions and characteristics to the peptide tag that was bound to the minichaperone GroEL(191-376). The seven residues thus form a constrained scaffold. We ®nd that GroEL does bind suitable mutants of these seven residues. The side-chains recognised do not have to be totally hydrophobic, but polar and positively charged chains can be accommodated. Further, the spatial distribution of the side-chains is also compatible with those in an a-helix. This implies that GroEL can bind a wide range of structures, from extended b-strands and a-helices to folded states, with exposed side-chains. The binding site can accommodate substrates of approximately 18 residues when in a helical or seven when in an extended conformation. The data support two activities of GroEL: the ability to act as a temporary parking spot for sticky intermediates by binding many motifs; and an unfolding activity of GroEL by binding an extended sequential conformation of the substrate.

The GroE chaperonin of Escherichia coli is essential for the folding and assembly of some newly synthesised polypeptides and for the recovery of stress-denatured proteins (Goloubinoff et al., 1989). This complex molecular machine consists of 14

identical 57.5 kDa subunits of GroEL, which form a cylinder containing a central cavity $45 AÊ wide (Braig et al., 1994; Saibil et al., 1993), and seven or 14 10 kDa GroES subunits, and is fuelled by ATP hydrolysis. Each 57.5 kDa subunit consists of three domains. The ATP-binding equatorial domain (residues 6-133 and 409-523) connects the two heptameric rings stacked back-to-back that form the cylinder. The apical domain (residues 191-376) forms the ¯exible opening of the cylinder and contains the polypeptide-binding and GroES-binding sites, which line the inner wall of the cavity. The intermediate domain (residues 134-190 and 377408) makes intersubunit contacts within a ring and transmits ATP and GroES-mediated allosteric effects.

Conformations of GroEL-bound Polypeptides

The mechanism of the GroE chaperonin is still under debate (Fenton & Horwich, 1997; Hartl, 1996; Lorimer, 1996). Certainly, there is a spectrum of mechanisms for GroE-mediated protein folding, depending on the nature of the substrate (Peres Ben-Zvi et al., 1998). The basic function of GroEL in facilitating folding is to provide a hydrophobic binding site (Buckle et al., 1997; Fenton et al., 1994; Zahn et al., 1996a), which prevents aggregation of folding intermediates and can lead to the unfolding of compact states (Zahn et al., 1996b). At one extreme, proteins can fold in a ``cage'' of GroEL subunits.
The recently determined crystal structure of the GroEL.GroES.(ADP)7 complex at 3 AÊ resolution shows that GroES caps the end of the GroEL ring and each of its seven subunits binds the apical, polypeptide-binding domains of GroEL via the extended segment of its modile loop (Figure 1(a)). ATP-driven movements of apical and intermediate domains of GroEL allow GroES to bind to and change the character of the polypeptide binding site from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic, facilitating the release of bound polypeptide (Xu et al., 1997). The bacteriophage T4 co-chaperonin Gp31 has a similar binding mode to that of GroES (Hunt et al., 1997). But, crystallographic studies on intact GroEL have not resolved the structures of any bound peptide substrate. The structural nature of binding of non-native proteins by GroEL is unresolved (for a review, see Horovitz, 1998).
Functionally active monomeric minichaperones (Chatellier et al., 1998; Zahn et al., 1996a), which contain only a part of the polypeptide binding domain of GroEL (Fenton et al., 1994), are more amenable to detailed peptide recognition studies than is the intact tetradecamer. The crystal structure at 1.7 AÊ resolution of GroEL(191-376) with a 17 residue N-terminal tag reveals the interaction of the Nterminal tag of one molecule with the active site of a neighbouring molecule (Figure 1(b)). This shows the detail of an individual binding site and suggests a model for the binding of long peptides around the rim of seven subunits in the cavity of the tetradecamer (Buckle et al., 1997). GroEL minichaperones, therefore, constitute a paradigm for understanding GroEL-substrate interactions at the atomic level.
Further experiments are required to answer the questions: What structural and chemical features of polypeptide substrates are recognised by GroEL? What conformations do substrates adopt whilst bound to GroEL? And how does GroEL discriminate between native proteins and its misfolded protein substrates? Random mutagenesis of simple peptides followed by selection by binding to immobilised GroEL (af®nity panning) can be used to determine the nature of the side-chains that bind. But this procedure has the disadvantage that the three-dimensional structure of such peptides is not generally constrained. To overcome this problem, we have used af®nity panning of GroEL minichaperones for a library of bacteriophages that display constrained peptides. As a peptide model,

we chose the C-terminal cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase I from the fungus Trichoderma reesei (Figure 1(c); Kraulis et al., 1989). This domain belongs to the knottin family, proteins that bind with a high degree of speci®city to their target (Le Nguyen et al., 1990). Knottins share a common scaffold comprising a small triplestranded antiparallel b-sheet and disulphide bond framework (Figure 1(c)). Cellulose binding is mediated by a 400 AÊ 2 patch of seven functional residues (Linder et al., 1995) that form a hydrophilic, ¯at face of the domain (Figure 1(c)). In the primary sequence, these residues are located in two separate regions: one close to the N terminus (residues 4, 5 and 7) and the other near the C terminus (residues 29, 31, 32 and 34). In the library, the seven functional residues were randomised (Smith et al., 1998). The side-chains of those seven residues have a similar stereochemistry to those in the proposed model for a substrate bound to GroEL (Buckle et al., 1997). The cellulose-binding domain thus offers a stable scaffold from which to identify the nature, size and shape of surface sites that bind GroEL. We interpret our ®ndings in the light of the structural models of the GroEL-GroES and minichaperone GroEL(191-376)-peptide tag complexes.
Results
Selection of cellulose-binding domain (CBD) proteins
Techniques for de®ning substrate speci®city of GroEL are readily suggested by analogy of GroEL minichaperones with monomeric Hsp70 family members, although the folding activity of the latter is ATP-dependent (Bukau & Horwich, 1998). The substrate-speci®city of chaperones has been de®ned using the panning of large libraries of phage-displayed peptides (Smith, 1985) against the immobilised, puri®ed chaperones (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993; Gragerov et al., 1994; Hightower et al., 1994).
To identify the nature, size and shape of surface sites that bind GroEL, we used af®nity panning of immobilised minichaperone short histidine tail (sht)-GroEL(191-345) for a large repertoire (5.5 Â 108) of bacteriophages that display CBD randomly mutated at the seven discontinuous positions on the domain ¯at face that binds cellulose (Smith et al., 1998). The immobilisation of minichaperone sht-GroEL(191-345) was determined by ELISA; immobilised minichaperones were functional in refolding cyclophilin A as previously described (data not shown; Altamirano et al., 1997). The results of the selection are summarised in Figure 2. The number of colonies increased substantially at each round of selection (Figure 2(a)). The titre of eluted phages (t.u. total) increased with subsequent rounds (data not shown). The ELISA signal corresponding to the binding of these phage populations also increased with later rounds of selection (Figure 2(b)).

Characterisation of GroEL minichaperonebinding CBD proteins
A potential drawback for this approach, however, is the non-speci®c adsorption of phages to the solid phase during panning (Adey et al., 1995). In the study of Hsp70 chaperones, speci®c elution of phages by the addition of ATP may have alleviated this problem. Therefore, we assayed single phage clones for binding activities by ELISA. The results obtained for three representative phages obtained after rounds 3 and 4 are depicted in Figure 3. The binding to immobilised minichaperone sht-GroEL(191-345) of the selected CBD-phage was highly speci®c. The binding background in the absence of phage or of wild-type CBD-phage was very low. A weak binding was also observed either against the non-substrate bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Figure 3) or the solid phase (data not shown). In addition, similar results were obtained using minichaperones devoid of the short histidine tail, indicating that the N-terminal tag did not interfere with the selection (data not shown). The binding activity was dramatically diminished after treatment of CBD-displayed phages with b-mercaptoethanol indicating the presence of disul®de bonds responsible for the proper fold of the domains on the phage tip (Smith et al., 1998; data not shown). The mutation Y203E abolished the in vitro and in vivo activities of intact GroEL (Fenton et al., 1994) and minichaperones (Chatellier et al., 1998). The mutation Y203E drastically decreased the binding of minichaperone GroEL to the selected CBD-phages (Figure 3). This suggests that the recognition of denatured polypeptide substrates and CBD-phages by minichaperones involves the same residues.
Sequences of selected CBD proteins
A total of 24 different CBD sequences were identi®ed from 55 clones with speci®c binding activity (Table 1). The diversity of sequences that bind minichaperone is consistent with the ability of GroEL to recognise a wide variety of unrelated

polypeptides. The frequency of amino acid type (hydrophobic, polar or positively charged) at each position of the discontinuous patches in the domains generated by selection is represented in Figure 4. The hydrophobic nature of the sequences is also consistent with the probability that GroEL binds to motifs preferentially buried inside properly folded protein. But the side-chains recognised do not have to be all hydrophobic; indeed polar and positively charged chains can be accommodated (see Table 1).
Similarities to the GroES mobile loop
The formation of the GroEL-GroES complex is mediated through a central hydrophobic tripeptide

(Ile25-Val26-Leu27) of the GroES mobile loop (Landry et al., 1993; Xu et al., 1997). The ``consensus'' sequence, corresponding to the more frequent residues at each position of the discontinuous patch and some other, adjacent to the mutated residues, shares a signi®cant degree of identity with the mobile loop of GroES, although the tripeptide is not fully conserved (Table 2).
To asses these similarities, the ability of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 16 to 32 of GroES mobile loop (see Table 2 for the sequence) to displace bound selected CBD-phages from GroEL minichaperone was tested by competition ELISA (Figure 5). The synthetic GroES mobile loop peptide does inhibit the binding of a similar amount (about 109 t.u.) of selected CBD-phages (Figure 5). The concentration of free peptide required for 50 % inhibition of binding (IC50) calculated from the competition curve ranges from 10 Â 10À6 to 30 Â 10À6 M (Figure 5). The af®nity of the clone selected at the fourth round of panning, CBD20, is about twice that of clones CBD1 or 7 from the third round of selection. The selected CBD-phages also inhibit to some extent the binding of GroEL (2.5 mM) to GroES (2.5 mM) in the presence or absence of 1 mM ADP (data not shown). Selected CBD peptides that bind tightly to minichaperone are good candidates for structural studies of GroEL substrate complexes.
Taken together, these results indicate that selected CBD-phages bind within the polypeptidebinding site of GroEL minichaperone as the synthetic GroES mobile loop peptide.

Discussion
To characterise the nature, size and shape of surface sites that bind GroEL, we used af®nity panning of immobilised functional minichaperone shtGroEL(191-345) for a large library of bacteriophages that display the fungal cellulose-binding domain of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase I randomly mutated at seven discontinuous positions on the domain hydrophilic, ¯at face that binds cellulose (Figures 2 and 3). CBD was chosen, since the side-chains of those seven positions are constrained and have a similar stereochemistry to those in a previously proposed model for a substrate bound to GroEL (Figure 1; Buckle et al., 1997). Wild-type CBD does not bind detectably to sht-GroEL(191-345), but mutations at those seven

positions (Table 1) lead to tight binding (Figure 5). Thus, we know which residues bind to GroEL and what is their overall stereochemistry.
Nature of the GroEL-bound polypeptides
The nature of GroEL-polypeptide interactions is promiscuous (Landry & Gierasch, 1991a). The GroEL-polypeptide complexes are predominantly stabilised by hydrophobic interactions (Fenton et al., 1994), although not always (Aoki et al., 1997). Hydrophobic and positively charged side-chains tend to interact favorably with GroEL whereas negatively charged side-chains tend to repel (Itzhaki et al., 1995). Overall electrostatic interactions also play a role in favoring the formation of GroEL-substrate complex (Perrett et al., 1997). The diversity of sequences found from panning that bind minichaperone is consistent with the ability of GroEL to recognise a wide variety of unrelated polypeptides (Table 1). We ®nd also that the recognised side-chains do not have to be totally hydrophobic, but polar and positively charged chains are accommodated (see Table 1).
Thus, GroEL recognises and binds a variety of polypeptides that share no obvious sequence similarity but is still able to discriminate between nonnative and native proteins (Martin et al., 1991; Mendoza et al., 1992; Schmidt & Buchner, 1992). Therefore, the information required for recognition is not supplied only by the speci®c primary sequence. A more ``global'' mechanism of recog-

The amino acids are divided into three major groups: those that are hydrophobic, those that are polar, and those that carry a positive charge (only one residue selected is negatively charged; see Table 1). The positions that were not randomised in the CBD library (Smith et al., 1998) are included.
nition should occur. The presence of solventexposed backbone peptide bonds and irregular (i.e. that comprises distinct regions of the polypeptide chain) hydrophobic surfaces is one common characteristic of non-native proteins. These surfaces could provide the necessary binding motif for recognition by the GroEL hydrophobic binding sites.
Conformation of GroEL-bound polypeptides
Extended b-strand
The selected constrained peptides exhibit a nonsequential linear binding motif with similar dimensions and chemical characteristics to the GroELbound mobile loop of GroES and the minichaperone GroEL(191-376)-bound peptide tag (Figure 1). The mobile loop of GroES that binds to the apical

domains of GroEL adopts a characteristic b-hairpin turn (Xu et al., 1997). NMR studies of the synthetic peptide representing the mobile loop of either GroES or Gp31, which differ in sequence, also adopt the same bulged hairpin conformation (Landry et al., 1996). The crystal structure of minichaperone GroEL(191-376) shows the N-terminal peptide tag (sequence GLVPRGS) bound within the polypeptide-binding site (Buckle et al., 1997) (Figure 1(b)). The seven residue (GLVPRGS) peptide binds to the same site as the mobile loop of GroES, and their conformations are strikingly similar (Figure 6(a)). Both adopt a roughly extended conformation that runs across the surface of two helices, H8 and H9, that form the binding site.
It could be argued that the binding of GLVPRGS in the crystal (Buckle et al., 1997) is artefactual, and that fortuitously the peptide is binding to the GroES binding site and the real binding site for substrates is elsewhere in the protein. But, in the accompanying paper, it is shown that the binding site of minichaperones in solution for real denatured states spans the same region of structure as in the crystal (Tanaka & Fersht, 1999). In addition, we have recently demonstrated a genuine interaction between this peptide and GroEL minichaperone in solution (J.C. et al., unpublished results) and our results indicate that selected CBD-phages bind, as does the synthetic GroES mobile loop peptide, within the polypeptide-binding site of GroEL minichaperone. Our ®ndings suggest that the binding mode and/or site of GroES to GroEL are likely to mimic substrate binding.
It is clear that a preferred conformation of GroEL-bound substrates is extended. Both polar and non-polar interactions are a feature of GroES and peptide binding (Buckle et al., 1997; Xu et al.,

show in the accompanying paper that the N-terminal fragment of rhodanese bound to minichaperone GroEL (193-335) adopts a helical conformation (Kobayashi et al., 1999). Thus, the binding site of GroEL is compatible with binding exposed hydrophobic and positively charged side-chains in extended b-strands and a-helices. Our model shows that the polypeptide binding site of GroEL can accommodate an helix of approximately 18 residues (three to four turns) or an extended structure of approximately seven residues (Figure 6).

Residues 191 to 376 of the apical domain in the GroELGroES complex were least-squares ®tted onto residues 191 to 376 of the minichaperone-peptide complex using LSQKAB (CCP4, 1994). The GroES mobile loop is in red, the minichaperone peptide is in blue. Helices H8 and H9 that make up the polypeptide binding site are coloured cyan. (b) Superposition of a-helix and b-strand and CBD side-chains. The Cb atoms of side-chains of CBD (yellow bonds), randomised in the bacteriophage library (Smith et al., 1998), were manually ®tted onto Cb atoms of helix H12 side-chains (residues 358 to 375 ) of the apical domain of GroEL (Cb atoms only, bonds drawn in magenta) and Cb atoms of a regular b-strand (blue bonds). The Figures are drawn to scale. Secondary structure representation is drawn with MolScript (Kraulis, 1991), and rendered with Raster3D (Merritt & Bacon, 1997).
1997). This is also consistent with preferential binding of an extended conformation: the hydrogenbonding potential of the substrate backbone can be satis®ed by polar residues in the active site (Buckle et al., 1997).
a-Helical conformation
Not only is the spatial distribution of the seven randomised side-chains of CBD virtually superimposable with those of an extended b-strand, but they are also virtually superimposable with those in an a-helix (Figure 6(b)). Amphipathic a-helical structures are recognized by GroEL (Brazil et al., 1997; Landry & Gierasch, 1991b). In addition, we

Structural and mechanistic implications
Specificity of binding of substrates
GroEL binds linear stretches of non-polar (mainly b-sheet formers; Ile, Phe, Val, Leu, and Trp), but also, polar and positively charged amino acids (including strong a-helix formers; Gln and Arg) that belong then to any type of secondary structure, or are even discontinuous in the polypeptide chain. For example, the side-chains of asparagine and glutamine residues could mimic a peptide backbone, ful®lling a dual role in the active site: aliphatic portions of their side-chains allow binding to hydrophobic side-chains whereas their polar groups can participate in hydrogen bonding with the substrate backbone. The presence of residues of varied shape, size and character at the binding site, which is of high ¯exibility, creates a very irregular and pitted surface that is highly adaptable to the binding of a multitude of substrates. Our data imply that GroEL can bind a wide range of structures, from extended b-strands and a-helices to folded states, with exposed sidechains. As suggested before (Richarme et al., 1994), GroEL could act as an amphiphilic organiser of protein folding. Denatured states have the highest tendency to bind to GroEL because they have the exposed hydrophobic groups in extended strands and amphipathic helices that have the highest inherent binding af®nity.
Passive mechanisms for unfolding
The binding of an extended conformation of the substrate not only implies a mechanism whereby GroEL discriminates between non-native and native proteins, but is also consistent with an unfolding activity of GroEL (Shtilerman et al., 1999; Zahn et al., 1996b) in the two following passive ways. First, speci®city for binding an extended bstrand causes tension at the active site of GroEL or minichaperones to stretch a bound denatured hydrophobic patch into an extended b-strand conformation (Buckle et al., 1997). Second, GroEL binds to a-helices in folding intermediates and misfolded proteins (Landry & Gierasch, 1991a; Kobayashi et al., 1999). Since a likely feature of misfolded proteins would be incorrectly packed amphipathic helices that expose non-polar residues on their surface, then binding of the hydrophobic

faces of such helices would lead to a tension to disrupt such complexes. The ``tension'' in both cases is just a consequence of equilibrium binding.
In vivo, it would be unfavourable for GroEL to bind its natural protein substrates in their native state. Since many native proteins have exposed non-polar patches of random shape and size on the surfaces, a linear-shaped binding site that binds incorrectly packed helices and applies binding pressure towards an extended structure would effectively discriminate against native structures.
Active rack mechanism
The peptide and GroES binding sites form a ring around the inside top rim of the GroEL cylinder (Buckle et al., 1997). A ring of contiguous binding sites has a great avidity for substrates that occupy multiple subsites. The mobile loop of GroES has evolved to bind to the polypeptide-binding site, effectively mimicking a bound peptide substrate. GroEL-bound peptides are displaced by GroES via a combination of competitive binding and movements of the apical domain (Xu et al., 1997). On the binding of ATP, or ADP and GroES, this ring becomes expanded into a crown-like structure (Roseman et al., 1996). The thrusting apart of subsites via the ATP-driven twisting and translation of the apical and intermediate domains (Xu et al., 1997) weakens further the binding of substrates (Corrales & Fersht, 1996). We have proposed that such movements may forcibly unfold the protein by mechanical forces (Buckle et al., 1997) as recently demonstrated (Shtilerman et al., 1999). It is also possible that GroEL cannot completely unfold misfolded structures by binding pressure alone, but once more than one apical domain has locally unfolded segments of structure ®rmly bound, mechanical unfolding could further unfold the protein. This would be possible only if binding is tight, since the forces needed to disrupt the structures would be relatively large.
Conclusions
GroEL has two main activities: (i) the ability to allow the folding of aggregation-prone intermediates (such as molten globules), bound weakly by their exposed hydrophobic surfaces, in isolation within the central cavity (the ``folding cage'') (Weissman et al., 1996); and (ii) the propensity to unfold kinetically trapped misfolded proteins that then have further attempts at productive folding (``iterative annealing'') (Todd et al., 1994; Weissman et al., 1994). These activities constitute a folding and annealing cage (Corrales & Fersht, 1996). GroEL binds linear stretches of non-polar, polar and positively charged side-chains that belong to any type of secondary structure, or are even discontinuous in the polypeptide chain. This widely applicable mode of binding allows the

widest range of features of denatured states to be bound by GroEL.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains
The E. coli strains C41(DE3), a mutant of BL21(DE3) capable of expressing toxic genes (Miroux & Walker, 1996), and TG1 (Gibson, 1984) were used.
Proteins expression and purification
The histidine-tagged (short histidine tail; sht)-minichaperones GroEL(191-345) wild-type and the mutant Y203E (Chatellier et al., 1998) were expressed by inducing the phage T7 promoter of pRSETA vectors with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) in E. coli C41(DE3) cells and puri®ed essentially as described (Buckle et al., 1997; Zahn et al., 1996a). GroE proteins, $57.5 kDa GroEL and $10 kDa GroES, were expressed and puri®ed as previously described (Chatellier et al., 1998).
Peptide library
The cellulose-binding domain (CBD) library has been described (Smith et al., 1998). The seven residues forming the discontinuous cellulose-binding patch (Linder et al., 1995) on the ¯at protein surface of the C-terminal CBD of cellobiohydrolase I from the fungus T. reesei (Kraulis et al., 1989) were randomised (Smith et al., 1998). The phagemid particles, displaying a large repertoire (5.5 Â 108) of mutant CBDs fused to the g3 protein of the ®lamentous phage fd (Smith et al., 1998) produced by rescuing the library with VCS-M13 helper phage (Stratagene), were screened.
Selection
Puri®ed sht-GroEL(191-345) minichaperone was coated on immunotubes (Nunc, Maxisorb) overnight at 4 C at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in bicarbonate buffer (50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6). The ef®ciency of the coating was veri®ed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay) using horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-GroEL antibody (Sigma) with 3H,3H,5H,5H-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Boehringer Mannheim) as substrate. The refolding capacity of minichaperone sht-GroEL(191-345) coated on immunotube for cyclophilin A renaturation was veri®ed essentially as described (Altamirano et al., 1997).
The phage repertoire was selected by panning on coated immunotubes essentially as described (Smith et al., 1998). Acid was used to elute bound bacteriophages: 5.1 Â 1012 transducing units (t.u.) phage particles were used for the ®rst round of selection and approximately 1 Â 1012 t.u. for the subsequent rounds.
Screening of phage-displayed peptides by ELISA
Single ampicillin resistant colonies resulting from infection of E. coli TG1 by phages liberated after selection were screened to identify those producing minichaperone-binding phage by ELISA essentially as described (Clackson et al., 1991; Smith et al., 1998). Binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase conjugated antiM13 antibody (Pharmacia), diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 25 mM NaH2PO4, 125 mM NaCl, pH 7.0), with 3H,3H,5H,5H-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Boeh-

ringer Mannheim) as a substrate. Reactions were stopped with 50 ml of 1 M H2SO4 after ten minutes and readings taken by subtracting A650 from the A450.
Sequencing of selected peptides
Individual clones were ampli®ed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and oligonucleotides pelBB.lmb3 and g3fwd.lmb2 (Smith et al., 1998). PCR cycle sequencing reactions with ¯uorescent dideoxy chain terminators (Applied Biosystems) were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions, using oligonucleotide lmb3 (Smith et al., 1998). Sequencing reactions were analysed on an Applied Biosystems 373A Automated DNA Sequencer and sequence analysis was performed using SeqEd (Applied Biosystems) and MacVector (IBI Kodak, New Haven, CT).
Peptide synthesis and competition assays
A peptide corresponding to the mobile loop of GroES (residues 16 to 32, numbered as described by Hemmingsen et al., 1988) was synthesised on a Synergy Personal Peptide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) which performs solid-phase synthesis using 9-¯uoromethylcarbonyl (Fmoc) protection with free termini. Cleavage from the resin was performed with tri¯uoroacetic acid (TFA)/phenol/thioanisol/ethanethiodiol/ water mixture and the peptide puri®ed by HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) and characterised by mass spectrometry. The puri®ed peptide was lyophilized and stored at À20 C.
Phages were puri®ed using PEG (polyethylene glycol) as described (McCafferty et al., 1990). To verify the structural integrity of peptide displayed, phages were treated with 1 % (v/v) b-mercaptoethanol in PBS for one hour prior to minichaperone binding by ELISA. The inhibition of the binding of the phage displayed CBD by the free peptide was analysed by phage-ELISA as described above, adding different concentrations (between 10,000 and 0.01 mM) of free peptide dissolved in 0.1 % (v/v) TFA solution to the phage supernatants.
