ABSTRACT Large conductance Ca21- and voltage-activated K1 (BK) channels, composed of pore-forming a-subunits and auxiliary b-subunits, play important roles in diverse physiological processes. The differences in BK channel phenotypes are primarily due to the tissue-speciﬁc expression of b-subunits (b1–b4) that modulate channel function differently. Yet, the molecular basis of the subunit-speciﬁc regulation is not clear. In our study, we demonstrate that perturbation of the voltage sensor in BK channels by mutations selectively disrupts the ability of the b1-subunit—but not that of the b2-subunit—to enhance apparent Ca21 sensitivity. These mutations change the number of equivalent gating charges, the voltage dependence of voltage sensor movements, the open-close equilibrium of the channel, and the allosteric coupling between voltage sensor movements and channel opening to various degrees, indicating that they alter the conformation and movements of the voltage sensor and the activation gate. Similarly, the ability of the b1-subunit to enhance apparent Ca21 sensitivity is diminished to various degrees, correlating quantitatively with the shift of voltage dependence of voltage sensor movements. In contrast, none of these mutations signiﬁcantly reduces the ability of the b2-subunit to enhance Ca21 sensitivity. These results suggest that the b1-subunit enhances Ca21 sensitivity by altering the conformation and movements of the voltage sensor, whereas the similar function of the b2-subunit is governed by a distinct mechanism.

INTRODUCTION
Large conductance Ca21- and voltage-activated K1 (BK) channels are composed of a-subunits (1,2) encoded by a single Slo1 gene and four types of auxiliary b-subunits (b1– b4) (3–8). They are activated by membrane depolarization and elevated intracellular Ca21 concentration ([Ca21]i). Due to a large single channel conductance, their opening effectively hyperpolarizes the membrane resulting in the closure of voltage-dependent Ca21 channels and, hence, a decrease in [Ca21]i. Thus, BK channels provide a negative feedback mechanism to control membrane potential and cytosolic [Ca21]i. Based on this mechanism, BK channels modulate various physiological processes including action potential repolarization, neurotransmitter release, smooth muscle contraction, and hearing (9–12). BK currents show various phenotypes in different tissue types, which are primarily due to the tissue-speciﬁc expression of b-subunits (b1–b4) that modulate BK channel function. For example, the b1-subunit, expressed primarily in smooth muscles, increases Ca21 sensitivity of the channel by shifting voltage-dependent activation to a more negative voltage range in [Ca21]i (3,13,14). Thus, the b1-subunit is essential in regulating tone in the vasculature (15), trachea (16), urinary bladder (17), and uterus (18). In contrast, the b2-subunit, expressed in the b-cells of the pancreas, ovaries, brain, and adrenal chromafﬁn cells, also

increases the Ca21-dependent conductance-voltage (G-V) shift and confers inactivation on the BK channel (5–7,19).
BK channel b-subunits share similar topology that includes two transmembrane segments (TM1 and TM2), a relatively large extracellular loop, and short cytosolic N- and C-termini (3) (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the coexpression of different b-subunits with Slo1 produces various phenotypes, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms are employed by these b-subunits to modify channel function. Most interestingly, the b1- and b2-subunits share 43% identical, or 66% conservative, residues (7), and both enhance Ca21 sensitivity of channel activation by increasing a Ca21-dependent shift in the G-V relationship. A previous study on the biophysical properties of the channel, however, suggested that these two b-subunits modulate channel activation by different mechanisms (20). By studying the effects of these b-subunits on ionic and gating currents of mSlo1 and ﬁtting the results to the allosteric conceptual framework provided by Horrigan, Cui, and Aldrich (denoted here as the HCA model (21)), it has been suggested that the b1-subunit may affect the apparent Ca21 sensitivity by altering voltage-dependent activation (20,22–24). In contrast, the b2-subunit may affect the apparent Ca21 sensitivity by altering both voltage-dependent activation and Ca21 binding (20). However, a recent study by Savalli et al. (25) suggests that the b2subunit may also affect BK channel activation by primarily altering voltage sensor movements. This study and others (23,26–29) have provided a solid characterization of the functional effects of b-subunits and important insights on the mechanisms of their action. Nevertheless, the molecular identities of residues/domains in a-subunits that are directly involved in the regulation of b-subunits are still not known

fully. This lack of knowledge limits our ability to interpret results from biophysical studies and undermines our understanding of the physiological role of BK channels in various tissue types. The identiﬁcations of the molecular components that are speciﬁcally important for the function of different b-subunits will help remove these limitations and provide molecular targets to alter physiological and pathophysiological functions of BK channels in speciﬁc tissues.
In our study, we investigate the role of the voltage sensor of Slo1 in the regulation of b-subunits. Like all voltage-dependent K1 channels, BK channels are composed of four Slo1 proteins (30) (Fig. 1). Transmembrane segments S5–S6 form the pore domain, with part of S6 forming the activation gate, whereas S1–S4 form the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) (31–34). We hypothesize that if the b1- or the b2subunit modulates BK channel activation by altering voltage sensor movements, a change in voltage sensor movements per se by mutations should affect the function of the b-subunits. A previous study by Ma et al. (34) demonstrated that mutations of charged residues in the VSD of Slo1 alter voltage sensor movements. In addition, the ionic currents of these mutations in various voltages and [Ca21]i have been recorded, and the experimental data have been ﬁtted to the HCA allosteric model (21,35). It was found that these mutations change various aspects of voltage-dependent gating of BK channels, including the number of equivalent gating charges (zJ and zT), the voltage dependence of voltage sensor movements (VHC), the open-close equilibrium of the channel (L0), and the allosteric coupling between voltage sensor movements and channel opening to various degrees (D) (34) (see Table 1 for deﬁnition of the parameters). We studied some of these mutations (Fig. 1) to examine if they also affect the ability of the b-subunits to enhance Ca21 sensitivity. We chose these mutations because they affect all parameters of

these mutations were covered. We found that these mutations speciﬁcally reduced the ability of the b1-subunit to shift the voltage dependence of activation in [Ca21]i but not that of the b2-subunit. These results indicate that the b1- and b2subunits affect distinct molecular processes during Ca21- and
voltage-dependent activation, resulting in speciﬁc alterations
of channel function.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mutagenesis and channel expression
All a-subunit constructs were made from the mbr5 clone of mSlo1 (36). Human b1 and b2 (KCNMB1 and KCNMB2; GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession nos. U25138 and AF209747) cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(1). The b2 with N-terminus deleted (b2ND)-subunit was created by removing amino acids from position 2 through 20. All mutations of mSlo1 and b2ND constructs were made using polymerase chain reaction with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The polymerase chain reaction–ampliﬁed regions of all constructs were veriﬁed by sequencing. mRNA was transcribed in vitro with T3 polymerase for all mSlo1 constructs and with T7 polymerase for b1- and b2ND-subunits (Ambion, Austin, TX). A total of 0.05–20 ng of mSlo1 mRNA or a mixture of 5–15 ng of mSlo1 and 25–50 ng of b-subunit mRNAs was injected into each Xenopus laevis oocyte 2–6 days before recording.
Electrophysiology
Macroscopic currents were recorded from inside-out patches formed with borosilicate pipettes of 1 ; 2 MV resistance. Data were acquired using a patch-clamp ampliﬁer (Axopatch 200-B; Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and data acquisition software (Pulse; Heka Electronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Records were digitized at 20-ms intervals and low-pass ﬁltered at 10 kHz with Axopatch’s internal ﬁlter. The pipette solution contained the following (in mM): 140 potassium methanesulfonic acid, 20 HEPES, 2 KCl, and 2 MgCl2 (pH 7.20). The basal internal solution contained the following (in mM): 140 potassium methanesulfonic acid, 20 HEPES, 2 KCl, and 1 HEDTA (pH 7.20). Increasing EGTA concentration of the basal internal solution to 5 mM gave a [Ca21]i of ;0.5 nM. For other [Ca21]i, CaCl2 was added to internal solutions to give the appropriate free [Ca21]i. Actual free [Ca21]i was measured using a Ca21-sensitive electrode (Orion Research, Cambridge, MA). A total of 50 mM 18-crown-6-tetracarboxylic acid (Sigma-

Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to internal solutions to prevent Ba21 block. Experiments were conducted at room temperature (22°C ; 24°C).
Gating currents were recorded with inside-out patches (37). The pipette solution contained (in mM): 127 tetraethylammonium (TEA), 125 HMeSO3, 2 HCl, 2 MgCl2, and 20 HEPES (pH 7.2). The internal solution contains (in mM): 141 N-ethyl-D-glucamine, 135 HMeSO3, 6 HCl, 20 HEPES, and 5 EGTA (pH 7.2); MgCl2 was added to the internal solution to reach 10 mM [Mg21]i. Voltage commands were ﬁltered at 20 kHz with an eight-pole Bessel ﬁlter (Frequency Devices, Ottawa, IL) to prevent the saturation of fast capacitive transients (37). Data were sampled at 100 kHz with an 18-bit analog/digital converter (ITC-18; Instrutech, Port Washington, NY) and ﬁltered at 10 kHz with an internal ﬁlter (Axopatch; Axon Instruments). Capacitive transients and leak currents were subtracted using a P/5 protocol with a holding potential of À120 mV.

Data analysis and statistics

Relative conductance was determined by measuring tail current amplitudes at

negative voltages as indicated for the wild-type (WT) and mutant mSlo1

channels. The gating charge movements were determined by integrating the

area under the rising phase and single exponential ﬁts to the decaying phase

of IgON at various voltages. The G-V relationship or the charge-voltage (Qc-V) relations of the WT and mutant channels were ﬁtted with the Boltzmann equation as follows:

where z is the number of equivalent charges, V1/2 is the voltage for channel in half activation, e is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. In Eq. 2, zJ is the gating charge associated with voltage sensor movement, VHC is the voltage for half of the gating charge movements at the closed conformation of the channel, and the other parameters have the same meaning as in Eq. 1. Curve ﬁttings were done with Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) using the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm to perform nonlinear least squares ﬁts. The means of the data were obtained by averaging from 4 to 30 patches and error bars represent mean 6 SE. Statistics were performed using SigmaStat 3.5 software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA); one-way analysis of variance with an all pairwise multiple comparison procedure (Tukey test) was performed. A p value , 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
Mutations of voltage-sensing residues disrupt the b1-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity
Among all charged residues in the VSD of Slo1 channels, neutralization of D153, R167, D186, or R213 reduces the number of equivalent gating charge. Thus, these residues are proposed as voltage-sensing residues (34). The mutations of these residues also alter other parameters (VHC, L0, and D) for voltage-dependent gating, indicating that these mutations profoundly affect the conformation and movements of the voltage sensor and the activation gate. Hence, we ﬁrst studied the effects of these mutations on the function of the b1- and b2-subunits.
The coexpression of the b1-subunit induces three major effects on the ionic currents of WT BK channels. First, the b1-subunit slows the activation and deactivation kinetics in 0

(20) and saturating 100 mM [Ca21]i (Fig. 2, A and C). Second, the b1-subunit reduces the steepness of the steady-state
G-V relationship (Fig. 2 B). The equivalent charge (z) that is
proportional to the steepness of the G-V relationship decreases from 1.28 6 0.02 to 0.72 6 0.01 in 0 [Ca21]i and from 1.32 6 0.05 to 0.88 6 0.03 in 100 mM [Ca21]i. Third, the b1-subunit increases the shift of G-V relationships to
more negative voltages (a leftward shift) in response to increasing [Ca21]i; the change in G-V relationship is À83.6 6 5.7 mV more with than without the coexpression of the b1subunit in 100 mM [Ca21]i.
Individual mutation of the four voltage-sensing residues
(D153C, R167A, D186A, and R213C) reduces the zT by 25% to 55% and shifts the VHC in mSlo1 channels (34). Consequently, the voltage dependence of channel opening,
measured by the position and the steepness of the G-V rela-
tionship, is changed (Fig. 2 B). Among the four mutations,
D153C and R213C shift the G-V relationship to more positive
voltages (a rightward shift) to such an extent, their macroscopic currents can only be measured in [Ca21]i . 10 mM to obtain reliable G-V relations (34). Therefore, we ﬁrst examined if the mutations affect b1 function at the saturating [Ca21]i of 100 mM.
For the four mutant channels, the G-V relationship with the b1-subunit in 100 mM [Ca21]i is either at a similar or a more positive voltage range than without the b1-subunit (Fig. 2 B, open and solid squares). However, the b1-subunit still slows
the rate of activation and deactivation of the mutant channels
(Fig. 2, A and C), indicating that these mutations do not abolish the association with the b1-subunit. In addition, the b1-subunit reduces the slope of the G-V relationship of D153C (z-values change from 1.31 6 0.06 to 0.94 6 0.03) and D186A (z-values change from 1.05 6 0.06 to 0.52 6 0.07) channels in 100 mM [Ca21]i in a manner similar to the WT channel (z-values change from 1.32 6 0.05 to 0.88 6 0.03) (Fig. 2 B). For mutations R167A and R213C, the b1-
subunit causes a relatively small reduction in the slope of the G-V relationship in 100 mM [Ca21]i (z-values change from 1.06 6 0.06 to 0.85 6 0.03 and 0.90 6 0.05 to 0.72 6 0.02, respectively). The G-V relationships of R167A 1 b1, D186A 1 b1 in 0 [Ca21]i, and R213C 1 b1 in 100 mM [Ca21]i does not reach saturation at 300 mV, and so the actual z-values
would be even smaller than those calculated from these G-V
relations. Therefore, the mutations of the voltage-sensing residues speciﬁcally disrupt the b1-induced shift of the G-V relationship in high [Ca21]i without a clear effect on the ability of the b1-subunit to change activation kinetics or the
steepness of the G-V relationship.
For the WT channels, the enhanced leftward G-V shift induced by the b1-subunit becomes less pronounced in reduced [Ca21]i (Figs. 2 B and 3). In 0 [Ca21]i, the b1-subunit even induces a rightward G-V shift. This b1-induced, greater
leftward shift of the G-V relationship in response to increasing Ca21 concentrations has been referred to as an enhanced Ca21 sensitivity of channel activation (20,22,23,

(A) Macroscopic current traces in 100 mM [Ca21]i for WT and mutant mSlo1 (upper panels) and WT and mutant mSlo1 1b1 channels (lower panels). Test pulses were with 20-mV increments in the same voltage range as in panel B for corresponding constructs. Repolarization potentials for WT, WT 1 b1, D153C, D153C 1 b1, R167A, R167A 1 b1, D186A, D186A 1 b1, R213C, and R213C 1 b1 channels were À100, À160, À80, À80, À100, À80, À100, À100, À80, and À80 mV, respectively. (B) Mean G-V relationships of WT and mutant mSlo1 channels expressed with and without b1-subunit in 0 and 100 mM [Ca21]i. The G-V relationships are ﬁt with the Boltzmann relation (solid line, see Experimental Procedures). (C) The b1-subunit prolongs the activation time course of WT and mutant mSlo1 channels. Activation time constants (tact) were obtained by ﬁtting current traces at various voltages with a single exponential function.

27,38,39). Fig. 3 A shows the V1/2-[Ca21]i relationship for R167A and WT mSlo1 channels in six different [Ca21]i. Although the b1-induced leftward G-V shift for WT channels increases with increasing [Ca21]i, mutation R167A completely abolishes the b1-induced G-V shift in all [Ca21]i. In contrast, the b1-induced G-V shifts in varying [Ca21]i for D186A mutant channels are not that simple (Fig. 3 B). If we simply compare V1/2-values at each individual [Ca21]i for D186A, the b1-induced leftward shift of the G-V relationship
seems to be abolished by this mutation, because the b1-
subunit causes either a large rightward shift or no signiﬁcant shift in any speciﬁc [Ca21]i. However, if we compare the V1/2 difference between 0 and 100 mM [Ca21]i (DV1/2-Ca), i.e., the total shift of the G-V relationship caused by Ca21 binding, it
is À71.6 6 3.1 mV greater with the b1-subunit than without
it. As a comparison, the b1-subunit enhances DV1/2-Ca by À128.0 6 4.7 mV for the WT channels. Therefore, the mu-
tation D186A does not completely abolish the b1-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity but reduces it by 45%.
Because mutations D153C and R213C shift the G-V re-
lationship to extremely positive voltages, it is difﬁcult to measure the effects of the b1-subunit in [Ca21]i lower than 100 mM. Therefore, we do not know whether the lack of the G-V shift in 100 mM [Ca21]i is because the b1-subunit loses its ability to increase Ca21 sensitivity of the mutant channels
or is simply because the b1-subunit shifts the G-V relation-
ship of the mutant channels to more positive voltages in all [Ca21]i. Thus, comparing V1/2-values in one speciﬁc [Ca21]i

might not be sufﬁcient to represent the b1-induced changes of the apparent Ca21 sensitivity. To bring back the G-V relationship of these two mutant channels to less positive voltages, we made double mutations D153C:E386A and R213C: E321A. E321 is located at the COOH-terminus of S6 and E386 is located at the cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). Compared with WT channels, the single-site mutation E321A or E386A shifts the G-V relationship to more negative voltages by ;À85 or À65 mV, respectively, at all [Ca21]i-values between 0 and 100 mM (Fig. 3, C and D). Most importantly, they have no signiﬁcant effect on the b1-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity (Fig. 3, C and D; p . 0.05). Fig. 3, C and D, also show the V1/2-[Ca21]i relationship for D153C: E386A and R213C:E321A mutant channels. The b1-subunit fails to alter the G-V shift of D153C:E386A double mutant at any [Ca21]i between 2 to 100 mM [Ca21]i, consistent with the results of the single-site mutant D153C in 100 mM [Ca21]i (Figs. 2 B and 3 C ). In the case of R213C:E321A, there is a parallel rightward shift of the G-V relationship with the b1subunit at all [Ca21]i, which is also consistent with the result of the single-site mutant R213C in 100 mM [Ca21]i (Figs. 2 B and 3 D). Similar to D153C and R213C currents, the activation and deactivation kinetics of the currents of double mutants slowed in the presence of the b1-subunit (data not shown), indicating that the b1-subunit still associated with the double mutant channels. Therefore, D153C and R213C mutations abolish the b1-subunit’s effect of increasing Ca21 sensitivity.

Mutations of voltage-sensing residues do not reduce the b2-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity
The coexpression of the b2-subunit with WT BK channels induces inactivation and, similar to the b1-subunit, a larger leftward shift of the G-V relationship in response to in-

creasing Ca21 concentrations, which is referred to as the enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity (20,38–40). To examine the role of voltage-sensing residues in the b2-induced Ca21
sensitivity enhancement, we coexpressed the N-terminus deleted b2-subunit (b2ND-subunit, see Experimental Pro-
cedures), which removes the inactivation peptide (4,20,26,
41), with the mutations of all voltage-sensing residues,

VSD and b-Subunits of BK Channels
D153C, R167A, D186A, and R213C, respectively. Similar to the effects of the b1-subunit on the WT channels, the b2NDsubunit slows down the activation and deactivation kinetics of these mutant channels (Fig. 4 A). The b2ND-subunit also induced a leftward shift of the G-V relationship for each of the mutant channels in 100 mM [Ca21]i (Fig. 4, B and C). Fig. 4 D plots DV1/2-Ca between 0 and 100 mM [Ca21]i for WT and mutant channels with and without the b2ND-subunit. Because mutations D153C and R213C shift the G-V relationship to extremely positive voltages, it is difﬁcult to measure the effects of the b2-subunit in 0 [Ca21]i. Therefore, we studied the D153C:E321A and R213C:E321A channels, for which we could record currents in both 0 and 100 mM [Ca21]i with and without the b2ND-subunit (Fig. 4 D). The b2ND can enhance the Ca21 sensitivity for all four mutant channels, as it does for WT channels. Taken together, the disruption of the VSD movements by mutating voltagesensing residues does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the effect of b2ND on Ca21 sensitivity. The differential effects of the mutations on the b1- and b2-subunits suggest that these two subunits modulate Ca21-dependent activation of BK channels through different molecular mechanisms.

Differential effects of mutating nonvoltage-sensing residues on the b1- and b2-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity
The mutations of the voltage-sensing residues affect the voltage sensor in two major aspects: they reduce the number of zJ and shift VHC to more positive ranges. These similar effects suggest that the mutations of the voltage-sensing residues may cause similar perturbations of the conformation and movements of the voltage sensor, whereas mutations of nonvoltage-sensing residues that do not cause the same functional effects may perturb the conformation and movements of the voltage sensor differently. To examine how these mutations affect the function of b-subunits, we studied R207Q and Y163E, which do not reduce zJ but shift VHC to either negative or positive voltage ranges (34).
R207 is one of three Arg residues in S4, whereas Y163 is located in S2 (Fig. 1). Similar to the mutations of the voltagesensing residues, in 0 [Ca21]i, mutation R207Q reduced the steepness of the G-V relationship of mSlo1 channels (z ¼ 0.57 6 0.03 vs. 1.28 6 0.02 for WT) (34,42) (Fig. 5 A).

the G-V relationship in opposite directions at 0 [Ca21]i. R207Q shifted V1/2 to hyperpolarizing potentials by À80.8 6 3.6 mV, whereas Y163E resembled the mutations of the voltage-sensing residues by shifting V1/2 to depolarizing potentials by 123.7 6 3.2 mV (Fig. 5, A and B).
The b1-subunit enhances DV1/2-Ca between 0 and 100 mM [Ca21]i by 146.1 6 5.1 mV for R207Q channels and by 55.5 6 3.0 mV for Y163E (Fig. 5), either an increase or a decrease from the b1-induced enhancement of DV1/2-Ca for WT channels (128.0 6 4.7 mV). Given these results, it seems that the b1-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity is not correlated with only a change of the shape or position of the G-V relationship or the reduction of the number of equivalent gating charges. However, all the mutations that reduce or abolish the ability of the b1-subunit to enhance Ca21 sensitivity also shift VHC to positive voltage ranges (Figs. 3 and 5) (34).
To further test if a positive shift of VHC is correlated to the reduction of b1-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity, we studied mutation Y163K. Unlike the mutation of the same residue (Y163E), Y163K does not reduce b1-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity signiﬁcantly (p . 0.05) (Fig. 5, C and D). The b1-subunit enhances DV1/2-Ca between 0 and 100 mM [Ca21]i by 105.5 6 5.0 mV, similar to that of the WT mSlo1 (128.0 6 4.7 mV) (Fig. 5 D). The effect of Y163K on VHC has not been reported previously. Therefore, we measured the gating currents of Y163K at various voltages (Fig. 5 E) and plotted the relationship between the on gating charge and voltage (QC-V; Fig. 5 F) (21). The QC-V relation was ﬁt with a Boltzmann equation (21) to obtain the number of equivalent gating charge (zJ ¼ 0.65 6 0.04) and VHC (136.1 6 3.0 mV). Opposite to mutation Y163E, Y163K shifted VHC to a less positive voltage. Thus, for the two mutations of the same residue, a larger reduction of b1-in-

duced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity is correlated with a larger positive shift of VHC. This result further suggests that b1 regulation is sensitive to a speciﬁc change of the conformation and movements of the voltage sensor.
We also coexpressed the b2ND-subunit with mutations R207Q, Y163E, and Y163K. The effects of the b2ND-subunit on gating properties of the channel were not affected signiﬁcantly by these mutations (Fig. 6). Importantly, the b2ND-subunit did not reduce the DV1/2-Ca between 0 and 100 mM [Ca21]i compared with the WT mSlo1 (Fig. 6 D). Thus, unlike the effects of the b1-subunit, the effects of the b2NDsubunit are not sensitive to alterations of the conformation and movements of the voltage sensor and the activation gate caused by the VSD mutations.
DISCUSSION
The ﬁne-tuning of BK channel properties by b-subunits greatly diversiﬁes physiological roles of BK channels in various tissues. Each type of b-subunits may have been evolved to target different parts of BK channel a-subunit to modulate various channel properties. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminus and the S0 transmembrane segment of Slo1 are important for the b1-induced G-V shift (27,28). In this study, we found that the disturbance of voltage sensor movements by mutations disrupted the b1induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity. For all the mutations, the reduction of the b1-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity is correlated quantitatively with the positive shift of VHC (Fig. 7 A). These results provide direct evidence that the effect of the b1-subunit on Ca21 sensitivity relies on the conformation and movements of the VSD. In contrast, the b2-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity was not re-

FIGURE 7 Relationship of the b1- and b2ND-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity with the parameters of HCA model for mutant mSlo1 channels (A, VHC) (B, zJ) (C, zT) (D, L0) and (E and D). The parameters of the HCA model (Table 1) for the WT and mutant mSlo1 channels except for Y163K were adapted from Ma et al. (34). The mutations are represented by numbers (panel A) in all panels. DDV1/2 is the b1- or b2-induced enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity from 0 to 100 mM [Ca21]i: DDV1/2 ¼ DV1/2 À mSlo1 1 b (0Ca À 100 Ca) À DV1/2 À mSlo1 (0Ca À 100 Ca). DDV1/2 (induced by the b1-subunit)-VHC relationship is empirically ﬁt with the Boltzmann function (panel A, solid line,). (1*) The b1-induced DDV1/2 for D153C was assumed to be 0 according to the result of D153C:E386A channels (Fig. 3 C); and the b2-induced DDV1/2 was for D153C calculated from the result of D153C:E321A channels (Fig. 4 D).

duced signiﬁcantly by these mutations regardless of how
voltage sensor movements were altered (Fig. 7), suggesting
that the voltage sensor movements are not directly linked to the function of the b2-subunit. These results suggest that the b2-subunit may interact with a different molecular domain of Slo1 to alter the responses of the channel to Ca21
binding. The b1- and b2-subunits share substantial structural sim-
ilarities, with 43% identical or 66% conservative residues (7).
They also share similar function by enhancing the apparent Ca21 sensitivity of activation. Therefore, it is remarkable that
distinct molecular mechanisms may underlie the regulation of Ca21 sensitivity by these two b-subunits. According to the
study by Orio and Latorre (20), one of the most prominent differences between the b1- and b2-subunit is that, whereas the effects of the b1-subunit can be explained by changes in voltage sensor movements, the effects of the b2-subunit can only determined if the allosteric factor for Ca21 dependence
also is altered. Similar to this result, our ﬁnding shows that
some mutations of voltage-sensing residues are sufﬁcient to abolish the effect of b1 in enhancing Ca21 sensitivity but have a much smaller or a complete lack of impact on the b2

effect. These results suggest that the b1-subunit may affect the voltage sensor to alter Ca21 sensitivity; whereas the b2subunit may inﬂuence Ca21 dependent mechanism more directly. It should be noted that such a mechanistic distinction may explain the primary effects of the two b-subunits, although each b-subunit may use both mechanisms for their total effects. For example, it has been suggested that the b1subunit enhances Ca21 sensitivity by affecting voltage sensor movements; in addition, however, it also changes Ca21 binding (22,24). Likewise, it has been proposed that the b2subunit alters voltage sensor movements. In a recent voltage clamp ﬂuorometry study (25), Savalli et al. demonstrated that the b2-subunit induces a leftward shift on the voltage axis of the ﬂuorescence versus voltage (F(V)) relations when the S3S4 linker of the a-subunit was labeled with thiol-reactive ﬂuorescent dyes. The authors suggested that this result indicated an alteration of the voltage sensor movements due to the association of the b2-subunit. Notwithstanding these complexities, our results indicate that various structural domains of both the a-subunits and the b-subunits can interact to modulate different molecular processes during channel gating and produce similar functional changes. Our results

also provide the basis to further identify these structural domains and molecular processes that are important for the regulation of BK channels by b-subunits.
How does the b1-subunit alter the voltage-dependent gating to enhance Ca21 sensitivity (i.e., the b-subunit–induced larger leftward shift of G-V relationship in response to increasing Ca21 concentrations)? Orio and Latorre (20) found that the association of human b1 reduced the number of zJ, decreased the intrinsic L0, and increased the allosteric coupling between voltage sensor movements and channel opening (D). The reduction of zJ was proposed as the primary cause for an enhanced Ca21 sensitivity. In a study of bovine b1, Bao and Cox (22) found that a shift of the voltage sensor movements to more negative voltages (VHC) induced by the b1-subunit was the primary reason for an enhanced Ca21 sensitivity. More recently, Wang and Brenner (23) found that mouse b1 shifted VHC to negative voltages and reduced L0, but the enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity was primarily due to the changes in L0. These studies have made it clear that the enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity by the b1-subunit is accompanied by signiﬁcant changes in voltage-dependent gating, suggesting that the voltage sensor is a critical structural component for b1 regulation. However, although the b1-subunits from three different species all enhance Ca21 sensitivity, this enhancement may not be the consequence of changes in any particular voltage-dependent parameters. No single gating parameter was signiﬁcantly altered by all three b1 orthologs. These results seem to suggest that the enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity and the changes in voltage dependence are all the consequences of a change in channel conformation and movements during gating, but that none of the phenomenological changes in gating parameters is the cause of others.
The results of this study demonstrate that mutating the voltage sensor can alter the enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity by the b1-subunit. These mutations also change voltage dependence of channel gating (34). Therefore, our results indicate that the voltage sensor is the primary target regulated by the b1-subunit for all the functional consequences of b1 association. We compared the changes in the Ca21 sensitivity caused by b1 to the changes in voltage dependence caused by these mutations and found that the changes in the enhancement of Ca21 sensitivity is quantitatively correlated with the shift of VHC but not with other parameters (Fig. 7). These comparisons indicate that only a speciﬁc perturbation of the conformation and movements of the voltage sensor would disrupt the ability of the b1-subunit to enhance Ca21 sensitivity. Such a speciﬁc perturbation also alters the stability of the voltage sensor at activated state. Further study is needed to identify the molecular mechanism for this speciﬁc perturbation and its correlation with VHC.
