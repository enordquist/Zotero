Abstract
Based on the concept that hydrophobic interactions causea polypeptide chain to adopt a compact structure, a method is proposed to predict the structure of a protein. The procedureis carried out in four stages: (1) use of a virtual-bond united-residue approximation with the side chains represebnytedspheres to search conformational space extensively using specially designed interactiontso lead to a collapsed structure, (2) conversionof the lowest-energy virtual-bond united-residue chainto one with a real polypeptide backbone, with optimization of the hydrogen-bond network among the backbone group(3s), perturbation of the latter structure by the electrostatically driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) procedure, a(n4d) conversionof the spherical representationof the side chains to real groups andperturbation of the whole molecule by the EDMC procedure using the empirical conformational energy program for peptide(Es CEPP/2) energy functionplus hydration. Applicationof this procedureto the 36-residue avian pancreatic polypeptide led toa structure that resembled the one determinedby X-ray crystallography; it had an a-helix starting at residue 13, with the N-terminal portiofnthe chain in an extended conformation packed against thea-helix. Similar structureswith slightly higher energies, but looser packing, were also obtained.

using another lattice model with interresidue energies of interaction calculated from the frequency of contacts (Miyazawa & Jernigan, 1985), demonstrated that the native structure is found among a very small fraction of lowenergy structures in a larger set of compact structures. Hao et al. (1992), using an off-lattice treatment and an all-atom representation of a polypeptide backbone, found that confining the chain to a fixed volume and shape, as given by the three principal axes of the molecular ellipsoid, induces a large amount of sheet structure. It can, therefore, be concluded that the computational time to search the native structure can be reduced by confining the chain to a set of compact conformations. This is the basic principle of the method developed in this work, which involvesthe ultimate use of a real chain rather than a lattice model.
The second basic idea of our procedure is that a crude search of compact structures can be carried out initially not at the atomic level but at the amino acid-residue level, thereby reducing the time required for acomplete search by several orders of magnitude. For this purpose, we have developed an approximate potential function that incorporates the tendency of nonpolar residues to form compact clusters in the early stage of the procedure; this is then followed by all-atom computations using the empirical conformational energy program for peptides (ECEPP/2) potential with hydration included.
We first describe the general strategy of the method, then theunited-residue potential and the method to convert avirtual-bond united-residue structure to a real chain. Finally, we present the results of the application of this method to a small protein, the avian pancreatic polypeptide.
Procedure
The general strategy of our procedure can be summarized as follows:
1. The polypeptide chain is first described in a virtualbond united-residue approximation, with the side chains represented by spheres. An appropriate potential is chosen to reflect the tendency for nonpolar residues to associate and for polarbackbone peptide groups to optimize their hydrogen-bonding arrangement, and to take account of local interactions. Then, the conformational space of the simplified chain is explored to find low-energy conformations (that appearcompact as a result of hydrophobic packing). We have usedthe Monte Carlo with energy minimization (MCM) method (Li & Scheraga, 1987, 1988)to carry out this exploration. A cluster analysis is then applied to divide the set of low-energy conformations into clusters (families)of similar conformations whose lowest-energy representatives are hereafter referred to as structures. Structures having energies within a chosen cut-off

value above the lowest-energy structure are saved for further stages of the calculation. 2. The virtual-bond united-residue structures thus found areconverted to an all-atom backbone. This is accomplished by optimizing the hydrogen-bonding arrangement between the backbone atoms but, at the same time, preserving the distances between a-carbons (virtual-bond structure) obtained in the united-residue treatment. This conversion was carried out with our recently developed dipole-path method, discussed inthe accompanying paper (Liwo et al., 1993). 3. Generation of the backbone is completed by carrying out EDMC (electrostatically driveMnonte Carlo) simulations(Ripoll& Scheraga, 1988,1989; Williams et al., 1992) in a “hybrid” representation of the polypeptide chain, Le., with an all-atom backbone and united side chains, still subject to the C“-distance constraints following from the united-residue simulations. The lattermeans that some or even all the distances of the virtual-bond chain obtained in the united-residue simulationare substantially preserved. This, in turn, is aimed at conserving the shape of the molecule that was obtained in the previous stage. Therefore, the resulting structure will mainly acquireoptimal peptide-group orientation, having almost unchanged virtual-bond geometry. In this stage, the distances between the a-carbons of the nonpolar residuesthat arein contact are maintained. Clustering is carried out onthe conformations obtained from each structure, and those lowest-energy representatives of the resulting clusters of conformations are selected that have both a low energyand a low root mean square (rms) deviation with respect to the parent virtual-bond united-residue structure. 4. Full (all-atom) side chains are introduced with accompanying minimization of steric overlaps, allowing both the backbone and side chains to move. Then, all-atom EDMC simulations are carried out in order to explore the conformationalspace in the neighborhood of each of the low-energy structures found in the virtual-bond united-residue treatmIennt. this stage of the calculations, we used the ECEPPI2 potential (Momanyet al., 1975; Nemethyet al., 1983; Sippl et al., 1984) with solvation energy evaluated with the SRFOPTmodel of Vileat al. (1991; seealso Williams et al. [1992]). Because this potential includes a solvation term, nonpolar residues should tend to remain packed inthe interior; hence, it is no longer necessary to impose the C”-distance constraints foundin stage 1. Nevertheless, the final allatom Conformations satisfied these constraints.
The general procedure outlined above is illustrated in a flow chart (Fig. l), while the details of the subsequent stages are presented on the following pages.

Hence, for glycine the position of the SC coincides with that of its C". Each psite represents the corresponding C'O-NH group. The distance between successive C" atoms is as-
signed a value of 3.8 A, characteristic of a planar trans
peptide group (a virtual-bond length [Nishikawa et al., 19741). We also assumethat the C"-C"-C" virtual-bond angles (0) have a fixed value of 90°,which is an approximate value corresponding to the global maximuimn the frequency distribution of virtual-bondangles in protein crystalstructures(Rackovsky, 1990). Accordingly,the united side chains also have fixed geometry with respect to the C" frame, the geometric parameters being taken from protein crystal data (Levitt, 1976). They are summarized in Table 1.
To define the geometry of thesimplified virtual-bond chain, we must distinguish between two cases, because the terminal a-carbons may or may not have side chains. If none of the terminal a-carbons has a side chain, i.e., if both residues are glycines or methyl groups, theonly variables describing the geometry ofthe simplified chain are

the C"-Ca-Ca-Ca virtual-bond torsional angles, y. If either or both terminal residues contains side chains, we extend the chain by adding a terminaldummy residue(s) to the terminal amino andcarbonyl groups. This process results in the addition of one (two) additional virtualbond torsional angles, as shown in Figure 2B. This one (two) extra degree of freedom allows for the rotation of the side chains of the N-and of the C-terminal residues.
It should be noted that our model hasmuch in common with other united-residue models (Levitt, 1976; Pincus & Scheraga, 1977; Crippen & Viswanadhan, 1985; Crippen & Ponnuswamy, 1987; Crippen & Snow, 1990; Seetharamulu & Crippen, 1991).
Useof the united-residue approach is equivalent to Boltzmann-averaging the intrachain interaction energy over all degrees of freedom except the virtual-bond torsional angles (Levitt, 1976), i.e., the averaging over all
side-chain dihedral angles x, and all angles of rotation X
of the peptide groups about respective Ca-Ca axes (see Nishikawa et al. [1974] and the accompanying paper [Liwo et al., 19931 for the definition of X). Obviously, such an approach to evaluate the united-residue potential is unrealistic, when applied strictly, because of the large number of variables over whicthhe average must becomputed (which involves numericalevaluation of multidimensional integrals). Therefore, instead, we assume that the Boltzmann-averaged energy of a polypeptide chain can be approximated by a sum of Boltzmann-averaged site-site pairwise interaction energies and some local terms, also
Boltzmann averages. To compute the average localterms, we consider short fragments (involving three consecutive peptide groups) of the chain.

cludes the average electrostatic interaction between the centers of the peptide groups, and accounts for hydrogen bonding within the backbone. Finally, U,,, consists of those local interactions involved with torsion around Ca-Ca virtual bonds.
The term UScisc,, Le., the average energy ofthe interaction within an isolated pair of side chains i a n d j (here Cy and Cy are included in SC; and SC,, respectively), is not calculated in this paper by the actual Boltzmann averaging; instead, we use a 12-6potential for thehydrophobicinteractions,andapotentialproportional to + r 6 for the hydrophilic interactions. The specific forms of these two potentials are arbitrary, but they satisfy the following two conditions: the energies of the contact interactions (i.e., at the distance equalto the sum of the van der Waals radii of the side chains)calculated by these formulas are equal to the energies of contact interactions estimated from protein crystal data (in thiswork, we calculate these contact energies from the data reported by Miyazawa and Jernigan [1985]);the asymptotic behavior of both types of potential is the same (except for the sign).

Scheraga (1976) for the glycine-glycine interaction energy; we use MJ values that arebased on alater, more extensive set of X-ray structures.
The factorsfProand fProPrino Equation 3 are given by Equation 6:
where UgiOrdU, giPro,_andU ~ f ~ pareothe lowest values of the average energiesU ,calculated from Equation 5 for two ordinary (non-proline),one ordinary and one proline, and two proline peptide groups, respectively.
The last term in Equation 1, the torsional energy, was evaluated as follows (Levitt, 1976). First, we constructed nine model terminally blocked dipeptides of the type AcX-Y-NHMe, where X and Y represent one of the three residues Gly, Ala, or Pro. The alanine residue represents all the L-amino acid residues except proline, which has a different pattern of local interactions, and glycine, which is also a special case because ist not chiral. This is a "basic" set. For each pair, we varied the virtual-bond torsional angle y from -180" to 180" in increments of 20" and Boltzmann-averaged the ECEPP/2 energy over all angles X (see Fig. 4). The number of degrees of freedom is reduced by one if oneof the residues in the pair is proline and by two if both areprolines because the L-proline residue has a fixed value of the dihedral angle 4 equal to -75". In order to calculate the dihedral angles 4 and $ (which are used as actual input values for ECEPP/2) from y, X1, X2, and X3 (defined in Fig. 4), including the restriction imposed by proline, we used the algorithm described inthe Appendix of the accompanying paper (Liwo et al., 1993). The resulting averaged energyis denoted by
ol%EPP/Z*
For each value of y, Ut,, was calculated from the Boltzmann-averaged ECEPP/2 energy, o&,p/2, from the following formula (obtained by direct application of Equation 1 to the model shown in Fig. 4):

The angles X I and h2 are identified with ( h l ) l and ( h l ) 2 ,while X3 is identified with ( h 2 ) 2(see Nishikawa etal. [1974] and the accompanyingpaper [Liwo etal., 19931).

A search through the conformational space of the united-residue force field (stage 1 of the procedure)
The Monte-Carlo-with-energy-minimization (MCM) algorithm is used in stage l of the procedure for an extensive search through the conformational space of the simplified chain. Because we have developed a new potential function, the version of the MCM algorithm is slightly different fromits original formulation by Liand Scheraga (1987, 1988) or from its more recent development (Ripoll & Scheraga, 1988,1989;Williamset al., 1992).
We start the MCM process with an arbitrarily chosen conformation (in terms of the virtual-bond torsional an-
gles y ] , . . . ,yn-3) and minimize the energy. Then, each
step of this process consistsof a random perturbation fol-

lowed by energy minimization; we apply a Metropolis test in order to accept or reject the new local-minimum conformation, unless both the difference in the energy and the difference in shape between the new and theold conformations are less than preassigned values (in this work 0.03 x n kcal/mol for energy and 10”for dihedral angles). The difference in shape is understood here as the average difference between the two sets of dihedral angles corresponding to two conformations k and I , and is given by the norm in Equation 9:

lier, in our united-residue calculations (stage l), we as-
sumed all 8’s to be fixed at a common “average” value of
90”, and this value cannot be maintained for anall-atom backbone. Therefore, it is not possible to use conversion algorithms based on geometric criteria, such as those developed by Purisima andScheraga (1984) or by Rey and Skolnick (1 992).Another reason for using the dipole-path method is that it finds the optimumhydrogen-bond network, preserving the given virtual-chain geometry. This results in a good approximation of a low-energy conformation of the all-atom backbone, subject to the restrictions imposed by the predefined virtual-chain geometry (Liwo et al., 1993).

Refinement of peptide-group orientation by means of the EDMC method with the use of a hybrid force field (stage 3 of the procedure)

The weights wi, i = 1, 2, . . .,n - 3 were chosento reflect
the fact that changing dihedral angles inthe middle of the chain has a greater effect on the conformation than changing dihedral angles near the chain ends. The second of Equations 10 reflects the periodicity of the values of the 7’s. Equation 9provides a better estimate of the differences between conformations than, for example, the maximum valueof the differencein dihedral angles, while avoiding the relatively time-consuming computation of the actual rms deviation between conformations.
In those rare occasions in which the rms deviation between the Cartesian coordinates of two structures, k and
I , is small, but the value of the norm 1) Ark‘1 is large (due
to compensating changes in dihedral angles, y), this will not invalidate the use of Equation 9. For example, when this norm is used for clustering, we will simply have to consider an additional cluster.
Conversion of the a-carbon chain to an all-atom backbone (stage 2 of the procedure)
The dipole-path algorithm used to convert the unitedresidue chain to the all-atom backbone is described in the accompanying paper (Liwo et a]., 1993). This method generates polypeptide backbone structures with optimized backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds in each generated structure. Thechoice of the dipole-path method to carry out the conversion of the a-carbon traceto the all-atom chain is motivated by the fact thatthis method uses only the y-angles and inter-C” distances as input values, while the “optimum” values of the virtual-bond angles 8 are obtained as a result ofthe procedure. As pointed out ear-

Once a set of low-energy structures has been obtained in the united-residue simulations (stage 1) and subsequently converted to all-atom backbones (stage 2), a backboneconformation refinement stageis introduced. Each of the structures obtained in the preceding stagesis subjected to Monte Carlo perturbation using the EDMC method (Ripoll & Scheraga, 1988, 1989; Williams etal., 1992). At this stage of the calculations the all-atom representation of the polypeptide backbone is maintained, while the side chains are stilI represented by single interaction sites.
For interactions involving the backbone atoms only, the ECEPP/2 force field is applied. In addition, the ECEPP/2 force field is applied for thelocal interactions (i.e., within a unit comprising an a-carbon with the attached side chain and the two adjacent peptide groups). Because no side-chain degrees offreedom are taken into account, theside chains of all amino acids except glycine and proline are treated as alanines (but with the C Bhydrogens neglected) when evaluating the local interactions. For glycine and proline, with no side-chain degrees of freedom, all atoms areconsidered in evaluating the local interactions.
For the calculation of the energies of interaction between the united side chains, the side-chain centroids are attached to the a-carbons along the directions of the C“-C’ bonds, at the distances and with van der Waals radii given in Table 1. The energy ofinteraction is calculated from Equation 2, using the E values calculatedfrom the respective MJ energies (Equation 3).
For thelong-range interactions between the backbone atoms andside chains, the van der Waals radii are calculated as arithmetic means of the van der Waals radii of the respective side chains (Table 1) and those of the corresponding backbone atoms, while the E’S are assigned the geometric meansof E of an ECEPP/2type-6 aliphatic carbon (Momany et al., 1975) and that of the corresponding backbone atom.

1724
In order to maintain the shapeof the structure as obtained in the united-residue calculations, a Braun and Ga (1985) type function is added to the energy:

[1 ndist
g(*, 9,Q ) = -
4 ;=I

(d,?- d,?o)2
if Idj - diol > 0.3di0
0 otherwise, 1) (1

where di is the ith C"-C" distance, diois the correspond-
+, ing distance in the united-residue structure, ndist is the
number of distances considered in g , and (+, Q ) is shorthand for all the dihedral angles 4, $, and w in the polypeptide chain.
In the function g, we do not consider the 1,2-or 1,3adjacent C" 's (if these distances were included, the function g would force the virtual-bond angles ofthe all-atom backbone to be close to 90" and thevirtual-bond lengths to be close to 3.8 A, as in the parent united-residuechain; these are, however, average values and are not conserved for an all-atom backbone). Moreover, we include in g only the distances between the a-carbons of the hydrophobic residues whose side chains are in contact in the corresponding united-residue structure. Here, a residue is considered hydrophobic if it is positioned to the left of glycine in the MJ contact energy table (Miyazawa & Jernigan, 1985)or is proline. Side chains i and j are considered to be in contact if the following relation holds for dsc,sc,, the distance between the side chains:

+ + dsciscI , 4(rf r!) 1 A,

(12 )

where r; and r; are the van der Waals radii of the side chains (Table 1). Sincethe topology of the clusters of hydrophobic residues is the most invariant characteristic of a protein (Dill, 1990), preserving the above-mentioned distances as obtained in the united-residue calculations is of primary importance. If we were to include all (except the 1,2 and 1,3) a-carbon distances, the time required for obtaining low-energy conformations would increase greatly, while the rms deviation with respect to the parent united-residue structure would not be lowerthan when considering hydrophobic contact distances only.
The complete function to be minimized is, therefore:
+, f(4, 0 ) = E ( * , +, Q ) + w ( 4 , +, 01, (13)

where E is the energy of the hybrid chain and w is the weight of the penalty function.
The presence of the penalty function gin the functionf to be minimized greatly complicates the EDMC simulations. If we were to sample the dihedral angles randomly, then the minimization o f f is likely to be influenced mainly by a possibly large g-term, resulting in a high energy and diminishing the conformation-acceptance rate.

A . Liwo et ai.
Therefore, in this work, the introduction of the penalty function g in Equation 11 isaccompanied by a procedure for sampling the backbone dihedral angles insuch a way
*,+, that the distance constraints included in g are not violated.
In other words, the perturbations of the variables 0 during the Monte Carlo sampling must conserve the distance constraints included in g. The procedure for such sampling of the dihedral angles is described inthe Appendix of Liwo et al. (1988).
The hybrid-force-fieldEDMC calculations, with an acceptance or rejection criterion based on energy alone, were carried out (withf of Equation 13 and w = 1 as the weight of the penalty function) for all conformations obtained in stage 2. However, before starting these calculations, three consecutive minimizationsoff were carried out (toremove possible steric overlaps gradually) with w equal 100, 10, and finally 1, taking the conformation resulting from the previous minimization as a starting point for the next one. The value w = 1 was chosen on the basis of several trial runs so as to achieve a reasonable acceptance rate while avoiding too high an rms deviation from the respective parent united-residue structure.
All-atom force field and procedure for calculations (stage 4 of the procedure)
The all-atom calculations are carried out by using the ECEPP/2 force field withthe SRFOPT model for hydration included (Vila et al., 1991). All the side chains and the N-terminal group were taken in their neutral form. However, in order to prevent the formation of hydrogen bonds that do not occur in realityt,he carboxyl hydrogens of the glutamic and aspartic acid side chains (the C-terminal group being -CONH2) are assigned ECEPP/2 type-I (aliphatic carbon hydrogen; Momany et al., 1975), as in the earlier study by Lambert and Scheraga (1989).
In order to obtain starting conformations freoef sidechain overlaps, partial optimization of the internal degrees of freedom of the side chains is first carried out, using a procedure similar to that described by Gibson and Scheraga (1987):
1. All the side chainsare initially assignedan extended
conformation (i.e., x, is set at -120' and the remaining dihedral angles x at 180").
2. The consecutive dihedral angles x are scanned over
the whole interval [- 180", 180°] (an increment of
+ 20" was used in this work), the total ECEPP/2
solvation energy being calculated at each step, and
the optimum position kept for each x. This step is
iterated until the energy does not decreasme ore than 1 kcal/mol after the scanning of all the dihedral an-
gles x has been completed.
3. The target function defined by Equation 13, with the hybrid-chain energy replaced by the sum of the all-atom-chain ECEPP/2 energy plus the solvation

free energy, and w = 1, is minimized, taking all the dihedral angles as variables.
4. The cycle consisting of steps 2 and 3is iterated until the energy does not decrease by more than 2 kcal/mol, when compared with its value at the beginning of the cycle.
An unconstrained EDMC run (i.e., without a Braun and GO [1985]type term in the function to be minimized) is then carried out foreach of the starting conformations obtained in this way.
Clustering
A cluster analysis was applied to group conformations (obtained in stages 1,3, and 4 of the procedure) into clusters of similar conformations. The united-residue structures (stage 1) were clustered taking the difference in dihedral angles y (Equation 9) as a measure of the distance between two conformations. Conformations with differences in dihedral angles of 430” were grouped into one cluster. This measure of the distance describes the folding-pattern differences better than therms deviation (at the best superposition of two conformations) when very diverse shapes are to be classified. It also keeps the number of clusters of conformations at areasonable level, for purposes of clustering.
For the structures with all-atom backbones obtained in stages 3 and 4 of the algorithm, the virtual-torsional-angle norm defined by Equation 9was not useful as a measure of the distance between conformations because we had to distinguish between structures with similar C“ geometry but different orientations of peptide groups. Because the same folding patterns are comparedin this case, the rms deviation at the best superposition of the selected atoms of two conformations was used as a measure of distance. Superposition was carried out by means of the singular value decompositionalgorithm(Golub & Van Loan, 1985), usingthe N, C“, C’, and C @atoms for the hybrid chain and all non-hydrogen atoms forthe all-atom-chain conformations. To define the clusters in stages 3 and 4, the value of 1.O A was chosen for the rms deviation cutoff, based on several trial calculations with the cut-off
value ranging from 4.0 to 0.1 A.
In all three stages, the minimal-tree algorithm (Spath, 1980) was used for clustering.
Results and discussion
Test protein
In order to assess the applicability of our algorithm to treat the protein folding problem, we chose the avian pancreatic polypeptide (APP) -a small 36-residueprotein. Its crystal structure was determined by Blundell et al. (1981) at 1.4 A resolution and then by Glover et al. (1983) at a

resolution of 0.98 A. The structure consists of a polypro-
line-like or collagen-like helixrunning from residues 1 to 8, packed against the hydrophobic face of an a-helix that extends from residues 13to 31. The C-terminus does not participate in the a-helix. Although the molecule forms a dimer both in solution (Chang et al., 1980; Noelken et al., 1980) and in the crystal phase (Blundelelt al., 1981), there is some evidence that even the monomer is sufficiently stabilizedby hydrophobic interactions between the two domains to retain the X-ray conformation (Chang et al., 1980; Noelken et al., 1980; Blundell et al., 1981). Moreover, the structureof this protein has already been computed correctly by Lambert and Scheraga (1989), using the pattern recognition importance-sampling minimization (PRISM) method.
United-residue simulations (stage I )
The simplified APP chain consists of 37 “a-carbons,” starting from Ca of Gly’ and ending at the trans amide hydrogen of the C-terminal CONH2 group (which is therefore considered asCy,), giving a totalof 36 peptidegroup centers. Thus, the number of backbone peptide groups in our model is 36, as in a real APP molecule.
The united-residue MCM run started from the completely extended chain (i.e., all dihedral angles y set at 180”) atT = 1,OOOK . This temperature was chosen after several trial runs at different temperatures. At lower temperatures, the molecule becametrapped in one of the lowenergy regions of theconformationalspace, while increasing temperature did not allow the fragments of secondary structurebeing formed to “survive” long enough to assemble into the complete tertiary structure. The simulation was terminated after 1,OOOMCM iterations. Cluster analysis revealed 37 clusters of conformations. The lowest-energy representatives of the five lowest-energy clusters had energies within 10 kcal/mol above the lowest energy. These structures, together with their energies and the rms deviations from the a-carbon trace of the crystal lPPT structure, are shown in Figure 5A-E. The deviations of the a-carbon trace of the lowest-energy united-residue structure from that of the lPPT crystal structure are shown in Figure6. These fivestructures were selected to carry out the next stages of the algorithm.
Additional MCM runs started from initial conformations other than the fully extendedone (all a-helical, partially extended [until residue 131, and partially helical [from residue 13to the C-terminus]) were also carriedout. They did not reveal any conformation lower in energy than that found in the first run. Moreover, all of the classes of structures with sufficiently low energies were found in these additional runs.
As shown in Figure StAhe, lowest-energy united-residue structure has the lowest rms deviation from, andis qualitatively similar to, the a-carbontrace of the lPPT structure (Blundell et al., 1981). Inparticular, the a-helix

best conformation of APP computed by Lambert and

Scheraga (1989). It can also be seen that, in our structure,

the two domains are oriented in an antiparallel manner,

while inthe crystal structure they make an angle ofabout

150" (Blundell et al., 1981). Finally, there are some mi-

nor differences in the loop region, although theshape of

the loop agrees qualitatively with that in the crystal struc-

ture, in that there is a turn conformation at A~p"-Asp".

The differences pointed out here are shown in Figure 6.

The next (higher-energy) structure (Fig. 5B) has an al-

most correctly formed a-helix, except that it starts one

turn later, but the N-terminal part is not packed against

it. This structure does not have a much higher energy

than the lowest-energy one. Next are structuresin which

the helix isbroken in the middle, which results ina greater

number of contacts between the hydrophobic side chains

(Fig. 5C-E).

Conversion of united-residue structures to all-atom backbone and hybrid-chain simulations (stages 2 and 3)
The five low-energy structures obtained in the unitedresidue simulation (Fig. 5A-E) were first converted to all-atom backbones by the dipole-path method (Liwo et al., 1993). The cut-off value of the electrostatic energy for considering two peptide-group centers as participating in a dipole-path network was 0.3 kcal/mol. Because of a high content of helical structure in the united-residue structures, more than 2/3 of the peptide groups participated in the dipole-path network. It is, therefore, very likely that the initial conformational states of at least that fraction of residues were located either in the correct or
neighboring (9, $) regions of Zimmerman et al. (1977)
(Liwo etal., 1993). Then, EDMC simulations withthe use of the hybrid force field werecarried out oneach of the five hybrid-chainstructures, using thealgorithm described above (section on Refinement of peptide-group orientation).
Each of the five EDMC runs, which ledto many intermediate local-minima energy conformations, was terminated after about 200 iterations, no further lower-energy conformations having been obtained in thelast 100 iterations.
The numbers of resulting clusterscorrespondingto each of the five united-residue runs (see section on Clustering) were 10, 20, 13, 3, and 16, respectively. The representatives (the lowest energyconformation within each cluster) of each cluster are hereafter referred to as substructures. The lowest-energy substructures corresponding to the five united-residue structures had energies of -96.7, -99.6, -85.5, -76.2, and -77.6 kcal/mol, respectively.
In all casesbut structure 2, the a-carbon geometries of the low-energy substructures were similar to those of the parent united-residue structures, the rms deviation being
of the order of 3-4 A (by low-energy substructures within

Protein compact conformation search

each structure we understand here those substructures whose energiesare not higher by more than 10 kcal/mol than the energies listed above). However, in the case of structure 2, whose N-terminal segment wasalmost unconstrained in the hybrid-force-field run, because of low compactness of this structure, the resulting lowest-energy substructure turnedout tobe more similar to the unitedresidue structure 1 (rms = 3.3 A) than to theparent united-residue structure 2 (rms = 4.7 A).
All substructures obtained by cluster analysis constituted theset of possible conformations used later to generate starting approximations for the all-atom EDMC simulations of stage 4.In order to select appropriate substructures, we applied the following criteria:
1. First, those substructures were selected whose energy was within5 kcal/mol above the lowest-energy conformation found in the corresponding hybridforce-field EDMC run.
2. From the substructures selected instep 1, those with an rms deviation from the parent united-residue structure not greater than 4 A were selected. Substructures with a higher rmsdeviation from the parent united-residue structure usually had a folding pattern different from that of the united-residue structure(e.g.,the helix present in theparent united-residue structure was broken).
3. From the substructures selected in steps 1 and 2, those substructureswere eliminated whose rms deviation with respect to anyother united-residue structure was lowerthan thatwith respectto the parent one. This happened only for structure 2, for which some of the substructures were closer to united-residue structure 1 than to structure 2, as stated above.
4. In addition to the substructures selected according to criteria 1-3, one more substructure of a given structure was accepted, if it satisfied criteria 2 and 3andcriterion1 with a 10-kcal/mol instead of 5-kcal/mol energy cut-off, and if it had the lowest rms deviation from theparent united-residue structure of all the conformationsbelonging to the same structure.
The numbers of substructures selected for all-atom simulations according to the above criteria were 4, 6, 2, 2, and 1, for structures 1-5, respectively, giving a total of 15 substructures.
All-atom simulations (stage 4)
In using EDMC in stage 4, no hydration was included in the electrostatic sampling part of the procedure. The starting conformations for the EDMC simulations were obtained from the 15 hybrid-chain substructures selected from the results obtained in the hybrid-force-field runs

(see the preceding section) by introducing all-atom side
chains, followed by the side-chain optimization procedure described earlier. In each of the 15 all-atom runs, about 100 EDMC iterations were carried out. As a condition for termination, it was required that no conformationlower in energythan those found so far would appear in the last 30 iterations.
Cluster analysis of each of the 15 sets of conformations obtained in the EDMC simulations was carried out, and the lowest-energy conformation from each cluster was selected as a representative of the whole cluster. As a result of this procedure, 128 representative conformations were obtained, ofwhich 28 were within 10 kcal/mol above the lowest-energy all-atom conformation foundin this study. Mosot f them were derived from united-residue structures 1 and 2. Structure 3gave onlytwo low-energy all-atom conformations, while no low-energy all-atom conformations were found for structures 4 and 5 . The to-
+ tal (ECEPPl2 hydration), ECEPP/2, and hydration
energies of the low-energy all-atom conformations, as well as the lowest-energy all-atom conformations found for structures 4 and5, together with other selected prop-
erties, are summarized in Table 4.It can be seen that the
lowest-energy conformation is the native-like one, as in the united-residue simulations. In thecase of structure 2, many conformations, in particular the lowest-energy allatom conformationobtained for this structure, aremore similar to the united-residue structure 1 thanto structure 2, as also observed in the hybrid-force-field simulations. Therefore, they were finally assigned to structure 1 (Table 4). It is also noteworthy that the energy ranking of the lowest-energy conformations corresponding to each structure is the same as obtained in the united-residue calculations (Table 4 and legend to Fig. 5A-E), which shows that ourunited-residue force field is compatible with the all-atom one. The conformational states of the lowestenergy all-atom conformation obtained for each structure, together with the conformational states of the lPPT
structure, are summarized in Table 5 .
The comparison of the lowest-energy conformation obtained in this study witthhe lPPT crystal structure reveals the same differences as appeared in the case of the lowestenergy united-residue structure: a longer helix and antiparallel packing of the extended and helical domains. However, in comparison with the lowest-energy unitedresidue structure, the loop region is closer to that of the crystal structure (Figs. 7, 8).
Although the native-like conformation was the lowestenergy one found in this study, the datain Table 4 indicatethat it is not separated from theconformations derived from structure 2 by a large energy gap. Figure 9, in which are superposed the low-energy conformations from both clusters, indicatesthat the N-terminal part may be quite flexible in a solution of monomeric APP, although it is either more loosely or more tightly packed against the a-helix.

a Conformational states of residues 2-35 for each of the five lowestenergy all-atom structures of APP.
The conformational codes of the individdal residues assigned according to Zimmerman et al. (1977).

energy-minimized conformations were generated in each run, the execution time being about 80-180CPU hours on the Stardent3000and about40-90CPU hours onthe IBM 3090.Energy minimization was carried out with the SUMSL (secantunconstrained minimization solver) routine (Gay, 1983). The MSEED algorithm was used to compute the solvent-exposed surface area and its gradient, to evaluate the solvent contribution to the energy (Perrot et al., 1992).
Conclusions
The method proposed here provides, in stages 1-3, estimates of the low-energy conformations of a protein that can later be processed (stage 4)by Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics methods. The actual prediction is made at the united-residue level (stage l), which requires a relatively short computation time. The purpose of the two further stages is to make a smooth transition to the allatom structure. For the avian pancreatic polypeptide, the lowest-energy conformations were native-likein both the united-residue and all-atom representations. It should be noted that APP was not included in the set of proteins used to evaluate the MJ contact energies (Miyazawa & Jernigan, 1985). Also, no other information regarding the native structure of this protein was incorporated into the united-residue force field. Of course, both the unitedresidue force field and the whole procedure must be tested on a larger number of known protein structures in order to assess the predictive power of the method.
It should also be noted that for all of the starting allatom conformations of APP derived from the lowest-

energy united-residue structure, the EDMC simulations found at least one cluster of conformations with energy less than 10 kcal/mol above the energy of the best conformation found duringall runs. Moreover, the lowestenergy conformations obtained in any EDMC run for which the starting conformationwas selectedfrom structure 1 are in reasonable agreement with the crystal structure of APP (Table 4). Therefore, areasonable structure could be estimatedby taking just one of the structures obtained from the united-residue structure of lowest energy.
In the case of APP, the energy ranking of the lowestenergy united-residue structures was also maintained at the all-atom level. The united-residue force field therefore

seems to be compatible with the all-atom force field at least in this case. This feature probably results from the fact that the united-residue force field was derived on the basis of energeticconsiderations(averagingthe energy of the all-atom chain over some of the degrees of freedom). This confirms our assumption that the choice of united-residuestructures to carry out further stages of the algorithm should be based on their relative energies.The first stage inthe conversion of the virtual-bond backbone to the all-atom backbone, the dipole-path method, is also based on energetic criteria, namely optimization of the electrostatic energy of the interactions between the peptide groups of the backbone.
