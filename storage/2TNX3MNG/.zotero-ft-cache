PVT and Phase Behaviour of Petroleum Reservoir Fluids

In Developments in Petroleum Science , 1998
Publisher Summary

The interfacial tension between fluid phases at reservoir and surface conditions are measured by various techniques. This chapter describes the most widely used and reliable methods to measure interfacial tension. The gas-liquid interfacial tension at high pressures is commonly measured by a pendant-drop apparatus. In this technique, a liquid droplet is allowed to hang from the tip of a capillary tube in a high pressure visual cell filled with its equilibrated vapor. The shape of liquid droplet at static conditions, controlled by the balance of gravity and surface forces, is determined and related to the gas-liquid interfacial tension. The pendant-drop method can also be applied to measure the interfacial tension of hydrocarbon-water systems. Laser light scattering techniques are used to measure the propagation of thermally excited capillary waves at the vapor-liquid interface, determining very low interfacial tension values (0.001 mN/m). Low interfacial tension values are determined successfully by measuring the gas-liquid interface curvature in an equilibrium cell. The interface between the phases is curved due to surface forces.

Measurement of Oil Physical Properties

Effects of Evaporative Weathering on Crude Oil Surface and Interfacial Tensions

Surface and interfacial tensions have no simple quantitative relationships in general to either the degree of weathering or the temperature. Surface tensions however, do not vary greatly from oil to oil; values from 25 mN/m to 32 mN/m are typical for almost all types of oil. Interfacial tensions for oil/water and oil/3.3% brine are often marginally lower than the corresponding oil/air surface tension. Oil/brine interfacial tensions are usually somewhat higher than the corresponding oil/(pure) water values. Typical values for both range from 18 mN/m to 32 mN/m. Surface and interfacial tensions tend to decrease with temperature and increase with weathering. Care should be taken not to overinterpret the significance of surface and interfacial tension values; however, the errors on these measurements are relatively large, ±15%, and the relative variations of the values are fairly small.

5.6.2 Interfacial Tension

Interfacial tension means tension at the interface of two immiscible fluids like oil and water. At the interface of two dissimilar fluids, the forces acting on the molecules of each of these fluids are not the same as within each phase and form interfacial tension. This interfacial tension behaves like a membrane separating the two phases. Interfacial tension, σ , can be defined as force per unit length necessary to maintain contact between the two tips of incision assumed in the interface ( Cosse´, 1993 ). Interfacial tension between two immiscible fluids is generally less than the surface tension of the fluid with higher tension, and often it is intermediate between the individual surface tensions of the two fluids ( Lyons, 2010 ).

4.8 Surface Tension

Surface tension is a measure of cohesive forces between liquid molecules presented at the surface. It is physically clear that surface tension and molecular structure are related, but no quantitative observations have been acquired. 115 The surface tension of traditional ILs ranges from 25.2 to 59.8 mN/m at ambient temperature. 116

The surface tension of choline-based DESs can be regulated by the type of HBD, the mole ratio of ChCl/HBD, temperature, and the water content. As listed in Table 8 , the surface tension of the choline-based DESs with malonic acid is larger than those of the choline-based DESs with urea. For example, the surface tension of ChCl/malonic acid (1:1) is 65.7 mN/m, and that of ChCl/urea (1:2) is 52 mN/m at 25 °C. The surface tension of choline-based DESs increases with increasing mole ratio of ChCl/HBD, that is, the surface tension follows: ChCl/glycerol (1:2) > ChCl/glycerol (1:4) > ChCl/glycerol (1:5) > ChCl/glycerol (1:10) > ChCl/glycerol (1:19). The surface tension decreases with increasing temperature. 51 Surface tension can be modeled with the hole theory, 27 which can be expressed by Eqn (11) .

3.5 Surface and Interfacial Tension

Surface tension is a measure of the force acting at a boundary between two phases. If the boundary is between a liquid and a solid or between a liquid and a gas (air) the attractive forces are referred to as surface tension, but the attractive forces between two immiscible liquids are referred to as interfacial tension .

Thus, surface tension refers to the elastic tendency of a fluid surface which makes it acquire the least possible surface area. At liquid-air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other (cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (adhesion). The overall effect is an inward force at the liquid surface that causes the liquid to behave as if the surface were covered with an elastic membrane. Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other, water has a higher surface tension (72.8 mN/m at 20°C, 68°F) compared to the surface tension of many other liquids. Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity, which is an effects effect (capillary action) that occurs when liquids are discharged and come into contact with rocks or minerals that contain pore systems. Interfacial tension is somewhat similar to surface tension insofar as cohesive forces are also involved. However, the main forces involved in interfacial tension are adhesive forces (tension) between the liquid phase of one substance and either a gas, liquid, or solid phase of another substance. The interaction occurs at the surfaces of the substances involved, that is at the interface.

Temperature and molecular weight have a significant effect on surface tension ( Table 5.7 ) ( Speight, 2001, 2015 ). For example, in the normal hydrocarbon series, a rise in temperature leads to a decrease in the surface tension, but an increase in molecular weight increases the surface tension. A similar trend, that is, an increase in molecular weight causing an increase in surface tension, also occurs in the acrylic series and, to a lesser extent, in the alkylbenzene series.

The surface tension of organic compounds and organic compounds products has been studied for many years. The narrow range of values (24–38 dyn/cm) for such widely diverse materials as gasoline (26 dyn/cm), kerosene (30 dyn/cm), and the lubricating fractions (34 dyn/cm) has rendered the surface tension of little value for any attempted characterization. However, it is generally acknowledged that nonhydrocarbon materials dissolved in an oil reduce the surface tension: polar compounds, such as soaps and fatty acids, are particularly active. The effect is marked at low concentrations up to a critical value beyond which further additions cause little change; the critical value corresponds closely with that required for a monomolecular layer on the exposed surface, where it is adsorbed and accounts for the lowering. Recent work has focused on the predictability of surface tension using mathematical relationships:
Dynamic surface tension = 681.3 / K 1 − T / 13.488 1.7654 × s g 2.1250 1.2056

in this equation, K is the Watson characterization factor, sg is the specific gravity, and T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. Briefly, the Watson characterization factor is a method that has been used to define crude oil in terms of the relative amounts of paraffin constituent and aromatic constituents. A characterization factor on the order of 12.5 (or higher) indicates a crude oil that is predominantly paraffin in nature while a characterization factor on the order of 10 or lower indicates a crude oil that is predominantly aromatic in nature. The K factor is also referred to as the UOP K factor ( Speight, 2014, 2015 ). The characterization factor may also be a part of the crude oil assay.

A high proportion of the complex phenomena shown by emulsions and foams, that are common when organic compounds enter the environment, can be traced to these induced surface tension effects. Dissolved gases, even hydrocarbon gases, lower the surface tension of oils, but the effects are less dramatic and the changes probably result from dilution. The matter is of some importance in environmental issues because the viscosity and surface tension of the organic compounds govern the amount of oil that migrates or can be recovered under certain conditions.

On the other hand, although organic compounds products show little variation in surface tension, within a narrow range the interfacial tension of organic compounds, especially of organic compounds products, against aqueous solutions provides valuable information ( ASTM D971 ). Thus, the interfacial tension of organic compounds is subject to the same constraints as surface tension, that is, differences in composition, molecular weight, and so on. When oil-water systems are involved, the pH of the aqueous phase influences the tension at the interface; the change is small for highly refined oils, but increasing pH causes a rapid decrease for poorly refined, contaminated, or slightly oxidized oils.

A change in interfacial tension between oil and alkaline water has been proposed as an index for following the refining or deterioration of certain products, such as turbine and insulating oils. When surface or interfacial tensions are lowered by the presence of solutes, which tend to concentrate on the surface, time is required to obtain the final concentration and hence the final value of the tension. In such systems dynamic and static tension must be distinguished; the first concerns the freshly exposed surface having nearly the same composition as the body of the liquid; it usually has a value only slightly less than that of the pure solvent. The static tension is that existing after equilibrium concentration has been reached at the surface.

The interfacial tension between oil and distilled water provides an indication of compounds in the oil that have an affinity for water. The measurement of interfacial tension has received special attention because of its possible use in predicting when an oil in constant use will reach the limit of its serviceability. This interest is based on the fact that oxidation decreases the interfacial tension of the oil. Furthermore, the interfacial tension of turbine oil against water is lowered by the presence of oxidation products, impurities from the air or rust particles, and certain antirust compounds intentionally blended in the oil. Thus, a depletion of the antirust additive may cause an increase in interfacial tension, whereas the formation of oxidation products or contamination with dust and rust lowers the interfacial tension.

9.5.11 Surface tension

Surface tension and interfacial tension exist when two phases are present, and the phases can be gas/oil, oil/water, or gas/water. The surface tension between gas and crude oil ranges from near zero to approximately 34 dynes/cm and is a function of pressure, temperature, and the composition of each phase. Interfacial tension is the force that holds the surface of a particular phase together and is normally measured in dynes/cm.

More specifically, the surface tension is a measure of the surface free energy of liquids, i.e., the extent of energy stored at the surface of liquids. Although it is also known as interfacial force or interfacial tension, the name surface tension is usually used in systems where the liquid is in contact with gas. Qualitatively, it is described as the force acting on the surface of a liquid that tends to minimize the area of its surface, resulting in liquids forming droplets with spherical shape, for instance. Quantitatively, since its dimension is of force over length (lbf/ft in English units), it is expressed as the force (in lbf) required to break a film of 1 ft of length. Equivalently, it may be restated as being the amount of surface energy (in lbf-ft) per square feet.

The interfacial tension is similar to surface tension in that cohesive forces are also involved. However, the main forces involved in interfacial tension are adhesive forces (tension) between the liquid phase of one substance and either a solid, liquid, or gas phase of another substance. The interaction occurs at the surfaces of the substances involved, that is at their interfaces.

The gas–liquid interfacial tension at high pressures is commonly measured by a pendant-drop apparatus ( ASTM, 2017 ). In this technique, a liquid droplet is allowed to hang from the tip of a capillary tube in a high pressure visual cell filled with its equilibrated vapor. The shape of liquid droplet at static conditions, controlled by the balance of gravity and surface forces, is determined and related to the gas–liquid interfacial tension. The pendant-drop method can also be applied to measure the interfacial tension of hydrocarbon-water systems.

The productivity of gas condensate wells can significantly be declined as the condensate bank evolves around the wellbore. Wettability alteration of formation minerals from strongly liquid-wet to intermediate gas-wet conditions using liquid-repellent fluorinated chemicals has shown promising results to mitigate such liquid-blockage issues ( Fahimpour and Jamiolahmady, 2014 ).

Interfacial Tension

A surface free energy resulting from electrical forces is present on all interfaces between solids and fluids, and between immiscible fluids. The electrical forces cause the surface of a liquid to occupy the smallest possible area and act like a membrane. The magnitude of the tension between two fluids is given by the interfacial tension. Interfacial tension (IFT) refers to the tension at a liquid/liquid interface. Surface tension refers to the tension at a gas/liquid interface, but is often used interchangeably with IFT.

Interfacial tension (IFT) is the energy per unit of surface area, or force per unit length. IFT is usually expressed in milli-Newtons/meter or the equivalent dynes/cm. IFT depends on the two fluids at the interface:
Fluid Pair	IFT Range (mN/m or dyne/cm)
Air-Brine	72-100
Oil-Brine	15-40
Gas-Oil	35-65

IFT can be estimated using the Weinaug-Katz variation of the Macleod-Sugden correlation and Fanchi's procedure for estimating parachors [ Fanchi, 1990 ].

The Weinaug-Katz variation of the Macleod-Sugden correlation is
(7.4.1) σ 1 / 4 = ∑ i = 1 N c P c h i ( x i ρ L M L − y i ρ V M V )

where

σ

    interfacial tension [dyne/cm]
P ch

    parachor [(dynes/cm) 1/4 /(g/cm 3 )]
M L

    molecular weight of liquid phase
M V

    molecular weight of vapor phase
ρ L

    liquid phase density [g/cm 3 ]
ρ V

    vapor phase density [g/cm 3 ]
x i

    mole fraction of component i in liquid phase
y i

    mole fraction of component i in vapor phase

Parachors are empirical parameters. The parachor of component i can be estimated using the molecular weight M i of component i and the empirical regression equation
(7.4.2) P c h i = 10.0 + 2.93 M i

This procedure works reasonably well for molecular weights ranging from 100 to 500. If you need a more accurate procedure, see Fanchi [1990 ].

Surface tension and cohesiveness

Surface tension may be regarded as the resistance offered by liquid water to forces attempting to deform or break through the surface film of water. The interface between two immiscible fluids behaves like a stretched membrane, and surface tension comes from intermolecular attraction, or cohesion. At an interface between two fluids or between a fluid and a solid container, the fluid molecules try to pull the interface inward. The surface tension is then defined as the tensile force per unit length of the line at the interface. It is an interesting property and, for water, the surface tension, measured in force per unit length, e.g., Newtons per meter (N  m − 1 ), is high and shows a slight increase as the temperature falls from 100 °C (0.0589 N m − 1 ) to 0 °C (0.0765 N m − 1 ).

An interesting application of surface tension is in calculating the size of raindrops. It can be shown that a simple mass balance for a spherical droplet may be written as
(3) σ 2 πR = p 1 − p 2 π R 2

where σ is surface tension, R is the radius of the droplet, and p 1 and p 2 are the pressures inside and outside the droplet, respectively. If the pressures are known (depending on local meteorological conditions), then the radius of the droplet can be determined.

The properties of surface tension and cohesiveness also work together in shaping the small rounded water droplets seen on a table top or a car windshield. The primary force for restoring larger wind-generated surface and internal waves of lakes is gravity, but the primary force for restoring the much smaller capillary waves or ripples on a lake's surface is the surface tension of the water itself.

The surface tension of water is sometimes used to advantage in parlor games in which someone claims that he/she can float a more dense (than water) steel needle on less dense water. When the needle is lowered slowly and carefully with its long axis paralleling the surface of the water, it may be possible to ‘float the needle’ because the high surface tension of the water may prevent the needle from sinking. Do not try this by lowering one of the sharp ends of the needle first, because a point application of the needle will not provide enough length for the surface tension to work on, it will exceed the surface tension of the water film, and the needle will sink rapidly.

There is a specialized community of organisms, sometimes called neuston, associated with the surface film. For many observers of nature, it is always fascinating to see small insects such as pond skaters or water-striders ( Gerris sp., within the insect order Hemiptera), and whirligig beetles ( Gyrinus sp. and Dineutes sp., within the insect order Coleoptera), running around on the surface of ponds, sheltered lakes, and some streams. Because of padded ends on the long middle and hind feet of water striders, and the much shortened but paddle-like feet of the whirligig beetles, the high surface tension of the water is such that the insects may dimple, but not break through, the surface film.

4.7 Surface tension

The surface tension of a fluid is the elastic tendency of the fluid surface which makes the fluid acquire the least surface area possible. Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity. At liquid-air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion). The overall effect is an inward force at the surface of the fluid that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface was covered by a stretched elastic membrane.

Water has an unusually high surface tension because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules to each other through a web of hydrogen bonds, water has a higher surface tension than most other liquids. Besides mercury, water has the highest surface tension for all liquids, which is due to the hydrogen bonding in water molecules. The surface tension of water causes water molecules at the surface of the liquid (in contact with air) to hold closely together, forming an invisible film. Surface tension is essential for the transfer of energy from wind to water to create waves. Waves are necessary for rapid oxygen diffusion in lakes and seas. Next to mercury, water has the highest surface tension of all commonly occurring liquids.

The high surface tension of water is relevant at two levels. First, below a length scale of about 1 mm surface tension forces dominate gravitational and viscous forces, and the air-water interface becomes an effectively impenetrable barrier. This becomes a major factor in the environment and life style of small insects, bacteria and other microorganisms. Second, at the molecular (0.1 to 100 nm; a nanometer is one billionth of a meter) scale the surface tension plays a key role in the solvent properties of water. The high dielectric constant of water also plays an important role in its action as a solvent. The biological significance of the expansion of water upon cooling and upon freezing, though crucial, is largely indirect through geophysical aspects such as ocean and lake freezing, the formation of the polar ice cap, and in weathering by freeze-thaw cycles.

5.2 Surface tension and wetting

Surface tension is the elastic tendency of a fluid surface which makes it acquire the least possible surface area possible. At liquid–air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion). The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane. Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length or of energy per unit area. Both are equivalent, but it is more common or conventional, when referring to energy per unit of area, to use the term surface energy which is a more general term insofar as it also applies to solids.

When a liquid is in contact with a solid surface, its behavior depends on the relative magnitudes of the surface tension forces and the attractive forces between the molecules of the liquid and of those comprising the surface. If a water molecule is more strongly attracted to its own kind, then surface tension will dominate, increasing the curvature of the interface. This is what happens at the interface between water and a hydrophobic surface such as a plastic item. By contract, a clean glass surface has hydroxyl groups on the surface that readily interact with and attach to water molecules through hydrogen bonding. As a result, this causes the water to spread out evenly over the surface, or to wet it. A liquid will wet a surface if the angle at which it contacts the surface is more than 90°. The value of this contact angle can be predicted from the properties of the liquid and solid separately.

The water surface acts like an elastic film that resists deformation when a small weight is placed on the surface which is all due to the surface tension of the water ( Sharp, 2001 ). A molecule within the bulk of a liquid experiences attractions to neighboring molecules in all directions, but since these average out to zero, there is no net force on the molecule. For a molecule that finds itself at the surface, the situation is quite different; it experiences forces only sideways and downward, and this is what creates the stretched-membrane effect.

The distinction between molecules located at the surface and those deep inside is especially prominent in water, owing to the strong hydrogen-bonding forces. The difference between the forces experienced by a molecule at the surface and one in the bulk liquid gives rise to the surface tension of the liquid.

If water is to wet a surface that is not ordinarily wettable, a detergent is added to the water to reduce the surface tension. A detergent is a special kind of molecule in which one end is attracted to water molecules but the other end is not, so these ends stick out above the surface and repel each other, canceling out the surface tension forces due to the water molecules alone.

Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules to each other through a network of hydrogen bonds, water has a higher surface tension (72.86 m-Newtons per meter for the water-air interface at 20 °C, 68 °F) than most other liquids. In addtion, surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity.
