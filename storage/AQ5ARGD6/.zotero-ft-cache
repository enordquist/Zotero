Peptide Binding and Release by Proteins Implicated as Catalysts of Protein Assembly
GREGORY C. FLYNN, THOMAS G. CHAPPELL, JAMES E. ROTHMAN

Two members of the hsp7O family, termed hsc7O and BiP, have been implicated in promoting protein folding and assembly processes in the cytoplasm and the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Short hydrophilic (8 to 25 residues) synthetic peptides have now been tested as possible mimics of polypeptide chain substrates to help define an enzymatic basis for these activities. Both BiP and hsc7O have specific peptide binding sites. Peptide binding elicits hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate, with the subsequent release of bound peptide.
Bn ECAUSE MANY PROTEINS REFOLD AFTER DENATURATION
(1), it has long been assumed that protein folding and assembly occurs spontaneously in cells. However, recent and diverse studies of protein folding, unfolding, and related processes (such as translocation across membranes) in vivo suggest that in many instances these events may be catalyzed. If so, then these catalysts can determine the nature of folding pathways and their

location in cells, defining in essence what folded states consist of and coordinating protein assembly in relation to existing cellular organization. How this works is unknown and has been difficult to determine for lack of a well-defined in vitro system. Here we describe an assay system that may mimic essential steps in this process.
Two distinct families of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent proteins have been implicated as catalysts, namely members of the groEL family (termed chaperonins) found in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (2, 3); and members ofthe hsp70 family, found both in the cytoplasm and in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4-6). The heat shock protein hsp7O family consists of several members (ranging from 70 to 78 kD) that are induced at elevated temperatures (4, 5), and of other members that are constitutively expressed (6). These constitutively expressed proteins include hsc70, also known as the uncoating ATPase for clathrincoated vesicles (7) and a binding protein BiP (8), also known as

GRP78 (9-11). Both are ATP-binding proteins and are similar to each other (7, 10). However, BiP, containing a signal sequence, is found in the lumen of the ER (12); hsc70, lacking a translocation signal, is found in the cytoplasm (10, 13). Timed labeling studies of the assembly of immunoglobulins have shown that BiP is transiently associated with the heavy chains until light chains are bound. Iflight chains are absent, BiP remains bound permanently and the heavy chains are retained in the ER (14). BiP is also transiently bound to influenza hemagglutinin (HA) subunits prior to their trimerization, and is bound to mutant or underglycosylated HA's that are unable to fold properly (15). Synthesis of BiP is induced by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER, whether a primary consequence of mutation in the nascent protein or a secondary consequence of misfolding due to insufficient glycosylation, caused by the absence of glucose or the presence of inhibitors (16-18). The cytoplasmic homolog of BiP, hsc7O, is required for posttranslational translocation of diverse proteins across ER and mitochondrial membranes (19).
The groEL gene product of Escherichia coli is required for assembly of bacteriophage capsids (20). Timed labeling experiments of the assembly of ribulose carboxylase in chloroplasts revealed that a protein closely related to groEL, and analogous to BiP, is transiently bound to unassembled protomers (2). Mutants in the groEL-related protein of mitochondria are able to import subunits into mitochondria, but functional (oligomeric) enzymes are not formed (21). As is the case for BiP (10), complexes of groEL with substrates also dissociate in the presence of ATP (22). Altogether, such studies offer indirect evidence that members of the hsp70 and groEL families catalyze ATP-dependent protein assembly and disassembly reactions (23).
Such activities, to be useful as a general pathway, would require the interaction of the catalysts with diverse polypeptide chains. We do not know, for example, (i) what features of a newly made or misfolded protein initiate interactions with a folding enzyme, (ii) how these proteins facilitate folding, unfolding, or assembly, and (iii) exactly what role ATP plays. We have now addressed these issues with the use of a well-defined and purified enzyme system consisting of the catalyst ATP and a protein substrate. The simplest mimic of a segment of native or an unfolded protein is a short peptide. We find that both BiP and hsc70 have sequence-specific binding sites for peptides. Peptide-binding elicits hydrolysis, and ATP hydrolysis is a necessary prerequisite for peptide release.
Binding of a peptide to BiP. To determine whether BiP would bind a short synthetic peptide, we incubated BiP, purified from

bovine liver microsomes (24, 25), with 3H-labeled peptide A (Table 1) and then isolated BiP together with any bound peptide by gel filtration (Fig. 1). Peptide A, a 15-amino acid fragment with four positive and two negative residues, was chosen for initial studies because of its availability. The purity of the BiP preparation is demonstrated in Fig. 3A, lane 2.
The peptide bound to BiP in a saturable fashion with a Kd of approximately 12 p.M (Fig. 1). At saturation, about 0.85 mole of peptide was bound per mole of BiP (78-kD monomer), based on Scatchard analysis of these data.

albumin at 1 mg/ml in the same buffer and centrifuged as described above.

The bound peptide, in the void volume, was quantified by liquid scintillation

spectroscopy. The small amount of BiP-independent background radioactiv-

ity (50 cpm) was subtracted for each peptide concentration. The amount of

BiP recovered in the void volume was quantitated by the intensity of stain in

densitomitry after SDS-PAGE with pure BiP as standards. On the basis of 78

kD being the mass of BiP, 4.7 pmole of BiP passed through the columns.

Peptide A was labeled with tritium by reductive methylation (32). Briefly, a

200-pl solution of peptide A (10 mg/ml) in 0.2M sodium borate buffer (pH

8.9) was incubated with 15 p.1 of 0.2M formaldehyde and 10 p.l of 0.12M

NaB[3H]4 (5 Ci/mmole, ICN) for 10 minutes at 4°C; and labeling was then

terminated by the addition of 10 pl. of 0.5M (NH4)2SO4. Labeled peptide

was separated from contaminating radioactivity and unreactive reagents by

gel filtration with Sephadex G10 in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 200 mM NaCl.

The first major peak of radioactivity was rechromatographed over a separate

Sephadex GIO column resulting in a single peak. This peak of radioactivity

coincided exactly with the peak of peptide as measured by ninhydrin (33).

For binding assays, the tritiated peptide was diluted with unlabeled peptide

A in the appropriate buffer to an activitiy of 480 cpm per picomole of

peptide. Data are presented as moles of peptide A recovered bound per mole

of BiP recovered.

misfolded protein upon incubation with ATP (10). The peptide-BiP complex isolated in Fig. 1 was formed in the absence of ATP. The
inclusion of ATP (50 RAM), but not ATPyS, eliminated this
complex, either by preventing its formation or facilitating its dissociation (Fig. 2). That the latter is the case is shown in Figs. 4 and 5.
BiP is present in the lumen of microsomal vesicles (12) (derived mainly from the ER) and comprises at least 0.4 percent of the microsomal protein, calculated from the amount of purified BiP we obtain from bovine liver. To test whether BiP (in preference to other ER proteins) binds to peptide A, we passed a detergent extract ofsalt-stripped, bovine liver microsomes through a column to which peptide A had been linked. A control column was prepared in which no peptide was used. A single major protein component of about 78 kD (along with numerous minor components) remained bound after the peptide A column was washed with IM $aCl (Fig. 3A, lane 3; compare with the microsomal extract, lane 1). The 78-kD component bound to the peptide columns was indeed BiP. The two proteins migrate identically on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electropho-
resis (PAGE) (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2) and their partial proteolysis patterns are identical (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Only the minor
components bound to the control column (Fig. 3A, lane 4). One minor component binding to peptide A coupled to Affigel migrates at a position corresponding to a molecular mass ofapproximately 94 kD (Figs. 3A and 4). A likely candidate for this protein is GRP94. Both GRP78 (BiP) and GRP94 are luminal ER proteins and are induced by malfolded proteins, suggesting related roles (16). The fact that BiP is affinity-purified as a result of peptide-Affigel chromatography implies that peptide binding is an unusual property that occurs in BiP and hardly any other microsomal proteins. Purified BiP also binds to peptide A columns.
ATP hydrolysis is required to dissociate BiP and hsc70 from peptide. The release of BiP from complexes with endogenous substrates (isolated from cell extracts) is ATP-dependent (10). BiP is not released with 1M NaCI, but dissociates rapidly on incubation with 100 FM MgATP at 25°C (Fig. 4, lane 2; compare with lane 1 representing what had been bound). Little release was observed with magnesium in the absence of ATP (lane 4), or 100 ,uM MgATPyS (lane 5). Moreover, a 40-fold (molar) excess of ATP-YS over ATP inhibited ATP-dependent release of BiP (Fig. 4, lane 6). These results demonstrate that ATP hydrolysis is required for dissociation of BiP from peptide, and explain why ATP (but not ATPyS) prevented the isolation of soluble peptide-BiP complexes
(Fig. 2).
In the preceding experiments (Fig. 4), we used saturating concentrations of ATP and measured the maximum amount of release over long periods; hence the effects of ATP on the initial rate of release are underestimated. A more complete analysis of the rate of release

(Fig. 5) shows both the time course and nucleotide concentration dependence of this reaction. The rate of release is about halfmaximal at 10 ,uM nucleotide. This low requirement for ATP is comparable to that for ATP-dependent clathrin release from coated vesicles catalyzed by hsc70 (13).
Hsc7O is present in the cytosolic fraction. To test whether hsc70, like BiP, is selectively bound by peptide A, bovine brain cytosol was passed through peptide A resin. Three major bands (82, 70, and 55 kD) were bound (Fig. 6A). The 70-kD band reacts with an antibody to a peptide containing a sequence conserved in all members of the hsp7O family (7) (Fig. 6B). The 70-kD protein, or hsc70, can be specifically released from the peptide resin by incubation with ATP and Mg2+ (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 to 6), as was the case for BiP. Little
hsc7O was released with ATP-yS and Mg2+, or with Mg2+ alone
(Fig. 6A, lanes 5 and 6). The identities of the 55-kD and the 82-kD bands are unknown.
Peptide-dependent ATPase activity. In efficient enzyme reactions, the hydrolysis ofATP is coupled to the work performed, with little hydrolysis occurring in the absence of all substrates. The peptide binding results imply that BiP can bind peptide in an ATPindependent fashion, and that ATP hydrolysis drives the release of the peptide. Thus, ATP should be hydrolyzed at a rate determined by the concentration of peptide.
The initial rate of ATP -hydrolysis by BiP is a finction of the

The microsomes were disrupted with an equal volume of buffer A, containing detergent (100 mMtris-HCI,pH 7.5, 0.4MNaCI, 10 mMNa2EDTA, and 2 percent sodium cholate), then diluted to a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml with buffer B (50 mM tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 0.2M NaCI, 5 mM Na2EDTA, and 1 percent sodium cholate). The suspension was clarified
(100,000g, 60 minutes, 4°C), and the soluble extract was passed over the
peptide-Affigel columns (36) at 40 ml/hour per milliliter of resin (800 mg of microsomal protein per milliliter of resin). The columns were washed with five column-volumes of buffer B, ten column-volumes of buffer B containing 1M NaCIl, and two column-volumes of buffer B without Triton X-100, in
succession. Bound material was eluted with 8M urea, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (37), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (38). AU chromatography was performed at 4°C. The composition of proteins bound to the peptide A-Affigel resin is shown in lane 3. Proteins that bind to a control

concentration of peptide A (Fig. 7A). This activity co-chromatographs with BiP on Mono Q-FPLC. The kinetic data give a linear double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 7B) yielding a Km for ATPase of 900 ,uM for peptide A. The observation of a peptide-dependent ATPase in BiP provides independent evidence of a peptide-binding site. The linearity of the double reciprocal plot suggests that there is only one kind of peptide binding site for ATPase activity.
Peptide sequence specificity. The peptide-dependent ATPase activity provides a rapid assay with which to screen peptides for sequence specificity. Synthetic peptides, ranging in length from 8 to 30 residues stimulated the ATPase activity of BiP with varying efficiencies (Table 1). Most effective was peptide I, having a Km for ATP hydrolysis of 12 ,uM. One peptide did not stimulate ATP hydrolysis detectably, even at high concentration (1.5 mM). None of the individual amino acids (when tested at up to 10 mM) detectably stimulated the ATPase of BiP. Although it is clear that there is considerable sequence or structural specificity (the Km's of even the limited set of peptides tested differ by at least three orders of magnitude), further studies are needed to elucidate the basis of peptide specificity.
We have performed fewer but similar studies with cytoplasmic
hsc70 purified from bovine brain (13, 26, 27). We found that hsc70
has a peptide-dependent ATPase similar to that of BiP, also yielding linear double reciprocal plots. The peptide C-dependent ATPase

Fig. 6. Peptide affinity and ATP elution of hsc70. (A) Bovine brain cytosol (60 ml, 10 mg/ml) was clarified (l00,OOOg, 60 minutes, 4°C), then passed over a 2.4-ml peptide A-Affigel column at 0.5 ml/min. The resin was washed with 5 ml of 50 mM tris (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCI, and 1 mM Na2EDTA, and
then with a similar buffer containing IM NaCl. After equilibration in the original wash buffer, the resin was suspended and divided into four equal portions, and each was sedimented (lOOg, 1 minute) and resuspended in 1.0
ml of 50 mM tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCI2 with either 50 ,uM ATP, 50 ,uM ATP-yS, or no additional nucleotide (or urea in some
cases). These reaction mixtures were then incubated at 25°C for 10 minutes
and centrifuged as before. Supematants were removed for SDS-PAGE analysis. All samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid before the electrophoresis.

activities of BiP and of hsc70 are compared in Fig. 8. The apparent
Km of hsc70 for peptide A is 770 F.M (900 pM with BiP) while that for peptide C is 55 F.M (150 FM for BiP) (Table 1). The Vmax of hsc70 driven by peptide A is 2.9 nmole/min per milligram (1.7 for
BiP) and 3.0 (2.0 for BiP) when driven by peptide C. All of these maximum velocities are similar to the maximum rate of ATP hydrolysis by hsc70 (uncoating ATPase) with clathrin cages as substrate (26), 2.6 nmole/min per miligram. Clathrin cages do not stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP (tested at 0 mg/mil). The peptide-independent ATPase activity of BiP is about 0.35 nmole/ min per milligram. Kassenbrock and Kelly (27) have reported this intrinsic ATPase activity, and also that ATP induces a conformation-
al change in BiP.
Implications for protein folding. Pelham (5) has suggested that the hsp70 family binds misfolded or aggregated proteins (or both), releasing them in an ATP-dependent fashion. These cycles were proposed to disassemble aggregated structures to allow subsequent, proper assembly. The constitutively expressed hsp7o family members would be adequate under ordinary circumstances, but during stress when proteins denature, individual members with appropri-
ately inducible promoters would accumulate to aid in the process. It seems reasonable to assume (although difficult at present to
prove) that the synthetic peptide substrates mimic the interaction of hsc70 and BiP with cellular proteins. It is striking that two gene
products, hsc70 and BiP, evolving independently at least since the divergence of yeast and animals, maintain quantitatively similar patterns of interaction with peptides. As these peptide-binding properties are evolutionally conserved and thus likely biologically relevant, it would appear that the hsp70 members can, in principle,

interact with many if not most suitably (see below) exposed
segments of any protein. These hsp70 members could bind to
nascent polypeptide chains prior to folding, or to partially denatured
or incompletely assembled proteins in which only a limited internal
segment of polypeptide chain is exposed. That hydrophilic and
charged peptides are substrates (in contrast to a common view that "heat shock" proteins necessarily interact with hydrophobic do-
mains (5)) means that BiP and hsc70 can in principle bind to the
kinds of peptide segments that are usually on the outer surfaces of
folded proteins. Binding energy could be used in any of a number of ways,
depending on the design of the protein substrate and the placement
of sequences that preferentially interact with BiP or hsc70. For
example, BiP or hsc70 could bind the polypeptide so as to retain it
in an imcompletely folded form competent for translocation across
membranes. For a differently structured polypeptide, binding to an
hsp70 might occur in a conformer that favors folding or oligomer-
ization on release. Other polypeptide substrates might be designed
so that the energy of binding of an exposed segment to an hsc70 is
used to unfold the protein as a whole, allowing refolding or
disaggregation on subsequent release. An appropriate peptide seg-
ment that binds hsp70 might even become exposed in a program-
matic fashion when subunits of a structure are polymerized with the
binding energy being used for release of protomers. This could
explain the use of hsc70 in uncoating clathrin coated vesicles. The strikingly slow turnover time of the ATPase of hsp70
members (about 0.2 per minute) may be important in tuning the
activity of these proteins to the rates of corresponding cellular processes. For example, in an animal cell it takes about a minute or
so for a protein to be synthesized or to be cotranslationally
translocated. If cycles of binding and release were to occur much
faster, the hsp70 members would be ineffective; if associations were
more permanent, such processes would be impeded.
In that catalysts of protein assembly like BiP and hsc70 must
somehow distinguish correctly folded from improperly or incompletely assembled proteins, they would seem to embody a relevant
definition of what successful folding actually consists of. Apprecia-
tion of what such proteins recognize would thus help in understand-
ing protein folding in cells. Interaction of the many randomly chosen peptides with BiP suggests that steric accessibility of peptide
segments is likely to be the limiting factor in preventing interactions in folded proteins. Peturbations in structure resulting in sufficient
(even if transient) exposure of peptide segments to allow binding could constitute the cellular definition of an "unfolded" state,
triggering the action of an hsp70 family member. A non-native state

would then be defined as that in which one or more potentially interacting peptide segments are accessible, and whose stability is exceeded by the energy made available by interaction with BiP or
similar proteins (23). In this regard, the free energy stabilizing the
entire structure of many folded proteins (5 to 15 kcal/mole) is in the range of that stored in a single molecule of ATP (29). Despite the promiscuity of their peptide binding sites, BiP and hsc70 exhibit
marked sequence preferences; for example, the Km's of BiP for various peptides differ by a factor of at least 103.
How do the Km values at hand compare with the concentrations of possible protein substrates in cells? A lower limit on sequence
specificity could reduce constraints on protein structure. Certain loops or ends could consist of sequences that do not interact well to
prevent spurious binding to surfaces of folded proteins; particularly effective binding sequences could serve as "signals" to guide interactions with hsp7o members, determining the manner and location in which the binding energy will be used. The steady-state concentration of growing polypeptide chains in the cytoplasm (one potential substrate or source of substrates for hsc70) can be estimated as follows. With a doubling time of 10 hours, about 0.2 percent of cellular protein is synthesized per minute. If it takes about 1 minute to make a protein, then about 0.2 percent of cytoplasmic protein in nascent. For a 30 percent solution of protein (an average size of 50 kD) in the cytoplasm (that is, a total protein concentration of about 5 mM) this corresponds to about 10,uM nascent protein. The steady-state concentration of freshly synthesized secretory protein in the lumen of the rough ER (substrates or potential substrates for BiP) can be crudely estimated as follows: The average number of ribosomes bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) for an individual hepatocyte has been measured to be 13 x 106 (30). Since each bound ribosome bears a nascent polypeptide chain being

inserted through the membrane, the concentration of nascent chains can be estimated by dividing the moles of bound ribosomes by the volume of RER per hepatocyte. Using 470 x 10- 5 liter as the
calculated volume of the RER (30), we obtain 50 ,uM nascent polypeptide. These represent minimum values for potential BiP and hsc70 substrates since these calculations assume only a single binding site per polypeptide and do not include the pool of not yet assembled but already synthesized chains.
Further and detailed analysis ofthe interactions ofmembers ofthe hsc70 family with a variety ofpeptide substrates and nucleotides can be expected to offer insights into the mechanism of action of these proteins. These studies should now be possible with the kind of simple enzyme system that we have described. Productive interaction of hsp70's with short peptides of variable length already suggests that these act in folding reactions as "single strand" polypeptide chain binding proteins as envisioned (23). The ap-
proach we have taken in using simple peptides as substrate analogs might also be usefil: in elucidating the mechanism and specificity of other catalysts of assembly, such as the groEL family of proteins.

Salt-washed microsomes containing 5 g of protein were solubilized by the addition of equal volumes of buffer C [100 mM tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2EDTA, and 2 percent Triton X- 100] and passed over a 250-ml DEAE-cellulose (Whatman) column that was equilibrated with buffer D [50 mM tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM Na2EDTA, and 1 percent Triton X-100]. After being

loaded with detergent-extracted microsomes, the column was first washed with five column volumes of buffer F and then with buffer D lacking Triton X-100 until the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) was that of background. The BiP-containing fraction was then eluted with buffer E [50 mM tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCI, and 5 mM Na2EDTA]. The major peak, as determined by A280, was concentrated in an Amicon pressure concentrator and loaded on a 10-mi ATP-agarose column (Sigma A 2767) equilibrated in buffer F [20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 25 mM KCI, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 1 percent sodium cholate]. The column was washed with buffer F, then buffer F containing 1M NaCl, each until the A280 approached background. The column was again equilibrated in buffer F, and BiP was eluted with 1 mM ATP in buffer F. The major protein peak was concentrated as before, then desalted over a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) in buffer F to remove ATP. The purified protein was frozen and stored at -80°C. 25. W. J. Welch and J. R. Feramisco, Mol. Cell. Biol. 5, 1229 (1985). 26. W. A. Braell, D. M. Schlossman, S. L. Schmid, J. E. Rothman, J.

cushion, and the ribosomes were extracted with Na2EDTA in the presence of O.SM NaCl. Microsomes containing approximately 5 g of total protein were obtained from 500 g of bovine liver. 36. Amino acid divinylbenzene resins and t butyloxycarbonyl chloride L-amino acids were purchased from either Vega Biochemicals or Pennisula Laboratories. Peptides were synthesized by standard solid-phase techniques and released from the synthetic resin by treatment with hydrogen fluoride. Peptides were resuspended in 5 percent acetic acid and lyophilized. The resultant peptide acetate salts were used
in further experiments. High-performnance liquid chromatogrpahy (HPLC) analy-
sis revealed purities of >90 percent. For binding studies, the peptide A was attached to Affigel 10 (Bio-Rad) (4 hours at 4°C in 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5) with enough peptide to give a final concentration of 5 mM in the packed resin. Excess N-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups were neutralized with 50 mM tris-HCl, pH
7.5.

urea for 10 minutes at 25'C. Extracted material was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5 percent SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Coomassie-stained bands representing BiP were quantified by integration scanning (Bio-Rad laser densitometer). The fraction released was calculated as the ratio of BiP eluted with nucleotide to the BiP eluted with urea plus the BiP eluted with
nucleotide.

chromatography over a G-10 column in 10 percent acetic acid. The purified peptides were lyophilized, redissolved in water, and lyophilized again. After dissolving the purified peptide acetates in buffer F, the pH was readjusted (with NaOH) and the solution was clarified (15,000g, 15 minutes). The purified peptides stimulated the ATPase activity identically to their corresponding crude
