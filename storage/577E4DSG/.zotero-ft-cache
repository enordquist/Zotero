Recent studies have suggested important roles for nanoscale dewetting in the stability and self-assembly dynamics of both physical and biological systems. Less known is the cosolvent (such as ethanol) eﬀect on nanoscale dewetting. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dewetting behavior in-between two hydrophobic plates immersed in ethanol aqueous solutions, particularly at low concentrations. Unexpectedly, the existence of a small amount of ethanol molecules promotes the dewetting transition in the inter-plate region at a greater separation that is otherwise non-existent in pure water or pure ethanol. We ﬁnd that a competition for ethanol molecules at equilibrium among the inter-plate region, the outer-surfaces of the plates and the bulk solution results in a depletion of ethanol molecules in the inter-plate region. Meanwhile, the preferred inward orientations of the ethanol ethyl groups at the liquid–vapor interface located at the edge of the plates make the inter-plate core more hydrophobic so that water molecules are more favored to be expelled, thus resulting in an enhancement of the dewetting. These ﬁndings provide a deeper understanding of the eﬀects of cosolvents on the hydrophobic interaction.

1 Introduction
Alcohols, which have a non-polar tail and a polar head, are widely used as cosolvents in both chemical and biological elds. As a short-chain alcohol and a very common small organic compound, ethanol has many diﬀerent roles, such as binding to the hydrophobic domains of pores, inhibiting recombinant Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptors and blocking ion uxes within channels thus causing behavioral disorders or anesthesia.1–4 Despite the above signicant roles of ethanol molecules in these nanoconned pores/cavities, little is known experimentally about their molecular-scale behavior within those pores/ cavities.
Recent investigations show that nanoscale dewetting, as an extreme case of hydrophobic interactions, can play an essential role in many chemical and biophysical processes, such as protein folding, ligand binding, ion channel gating and the selfassembly of amphiphiles into micelles and membranes.5–11 Nanoscale dewetting here means that there exists a water dewetting transition when in some extreme cases the hydrophobic interaction is very strong, i.e. when water molecules trapped inside nanopores/nanocavities or in-between nano-distance-

separated hydrophobic surfaces spontaneously evaporate.12–26 Although ethanol aqueous solutions are abundant in chemical and biophysical systems, there is little study on the dewetting property of ethanol aqueous solutions. On the other hand, there have been some theoretical studies, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, focusing on the eﬀects of hydrogen bonding on the structures of alcohol–water mixtures,27–30 and the wetting of water31 and water–ethanol droplets on a non-polar surface.32 Since ethanol is a small amphiphilic molecule, one may expect that the existence of ethanol molecules in the dilute solution will degrade the dewetting behavior.
In this paper, we will show the unexpected promotion of the dewetting transitions in-between two hydrophobic plates (THPs) in ethanol aqueous solutions by using extensive MD simulations. We nd that ethanol molecules prefer to accumulate at the liquid–vapor interface and that at low concentrations the competition for ethanol molecules among the inter-plate region, the outer-surfaces of the plates and the bulk solution results in insuﬃcient ethanol molecules to ll the inter-plate region at equilibrium. Meanwhile, the preferred inward orientations of the ethanol ethyl groups at the liquid– vapor interface located at the edge of the plates make the interplate core more hydrophobic so that water molecules are more favored to be expelled, thus resulting in a surprising enhancement of the dewetting under low ethanol concentrations. Our observations might be helpful for the better understanding of the dewetting transitions with cosolvents at the nanoscale, which may have technological and biological implications, for

2 Simulation methods
The MD package GROMACS version 3.3.333 was used for all simulations with a time step of 1 fs. The Lennard-Jones diameter and well depth of each particle were sp ¼ 0.4 nm and 3p ¼ 0.5 kJ molÀ1, respectively. These parameters are the same with the model hydrophobic plates used in the previous work by Berne et al.34 Parameters for ethanol molecules were taken from the all-atom OPLS (optimized potentials for liquid simulations) force eld.35 The rigid extended simple point charge water was used throughout36 and the SETTLE algorithm was used to keep the O–H distance xed at 1 A˚ and the H–O–H angle at 109.47 .37 Geometric combining rules were applied to calculate the Lennard-Jones interactions between diﬀerent particles: 3ij ¼ (3ii3jj)1/2 and sij ¼ (siisjj)1/2, where 3ii and sii are the parameters of atom i for the Lennard-Jones diameter and well depth, respectively. As listed in Table 1, all the 16 solution systems with diﬀerent initial ethanol concentrations of 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 8%, 10%, 12%, 15%, 18%, 20%, 25% and 100% (including 10026–12044 atoms) were rst equilibrated at a constant pressure and temperature (NPT) of 1 bar and 298 K for 5 ns, aer which the two plates were added to the simulation boxes (see Fig. 1(a)). Then, 15 ns NPT simulations were carried out aer energy minimization with a steepest-descent algorithm. The NPT ensemble was maintained at a constant 298 K temperature using the Nos´e–Hoover thermostat38 and 1 bar pressure using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat.39 The particle-mesh Ewald method40 was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions, and van der Waals interactions were treated with a cutoﬀ distance of 1.2 nm.
3 Results and discussion
The model system with two parallel hydrophobic plates immersed in the ethanol aqueous solution is shown in Fig. 1(a).

Each square plate with the size of 2.32 Â 2.32 nm2 was modeled as a single-layer of 49 neutral Lennard-Jones particles, which were arranged in a square lattice with a nearest-neighbor spacing of 0.32 nm. We have prepared 16 solution systems with diﬀerent ethanol concentrations of 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 8%, 10%, 12%, 15%, 18%, 20%, 25% and 100%, respectively. The two plates were constrained with a harmonic potential (k ¼ 9000 kJ molÀ1 A˚À2) at initial inter-plate separations from 0.7 to 1.5 nm. Cubic periodic simulation boxes were used with side lengths from 4.8 to 5.1 nm. We allowed the rst 5 ns of simulation time for system equilibration, and the subsequent 10–25 ns for data collection (even longer simulations, up to 100 ns, were collected and the results were basically the same, indicating that the nanoscale dewetting process is very fast).
Fig. 1(b) shows the atom number of the ethanol and water molecules located between the THPs as a function of the plate separation for four diﬀerent systems (pure water, 5% ethanol, 10% ethanol and pure ethanol). For convenience, the atom numbers of the inter-plate ethanol and water molecules are denoted by Nethanol and Nwater, respectively. For the pure water system, Nwater increases very slowly as D increases from 0.7 nm, it jumps to the large value of $370 at D ¼ 1.2 nm and then continues to increase gradually. The small value of Nwater at D < 1.2 nm indicates that a vapor phase is dominant between the THPs, as shown by the typical snapshot in Fig. 1(d), consistent with the previous observations that a dewetting transition happens with an increased connement of the liquid phase between plates.13,15,41 In contrast, at D ¼ 1.2 nm and beyond, water forms a dense liquid (Fig. 1(e)).
Nethanol for the pure ethanol system increases much faster than Nwater for the pure water system. There is a small plateau at D ¼ 0.8–1.1 nm with one layer of ethanol molecules lling the inter-plate region, as shown in Fig. 1(f). This result is in agreement with the observation that ethanol molecules wet hydrophobic solid surfaces more easily than water.32 Aer the plateau, Nethanol increases again. Ethanol also forms a dense liquid at D ¼ 1.2 nm (see Fig. 1(g)).

Fig. 1(c) shows the total atom number of the ethanol and water molecules located between the THPs as a function of the plate separation for four diﬀerent systems (pure water, 5% ethanol, 10% ethanol and pure ethanol). For the two systems with 5% and 10% ethanol concentrations, interestingly, the total number of inter-plate ethanol and water atoms (Nwater + Nethanol) is still quite small at D ¼ 1.2 nm. As shown in Fig. 1(h), there is still a vapor phase between the THPs at D ¼ 1.2 nm, indicating that both water and ethanol are unable to ll the inter-plate region completely. This is unexpected since water or ethanol completely lls the inter-plate space at D ¼ 1.2 nm for both the pure water and pure ethanol systems. It seems that the addition of ethanol promotes the water dewetting transition at a

greater separation that is otherwise non-existent in pure water or pure ethanol.
In order to better characterize the wetting and dewetting behavior, we computed the critical dewetting distance, denoted by DC, below which there is a stable vapor phase between the THPs.6,7,24,25 In our study, we name a stable vapor phase between the THPs if the inter-plate atom density (Nwater + Nethanol)/ (Deﬀective Â L2) is below 60% of the inter-plate atom density of the liquid state (dened as the density at D ¼ 1.5 nm). Here, Deﬀective ¼ (D À 0.3) nm is the eﬀective inter-plate distance, and L is the side length of 2.32 nm. The results are shown in Fig. 2. DC initially increases almost monotonically with the ethanol concentration, P. DC reaches 1.35 nm for the ethanol aqueous

solutions of 4%, 5%, 8% and 10%, which is much larger than DC ¼ 1.2 nm for the pure water system. Only very small changes in the DC value are observed from P ¼ 4% to 10% due to the nite size of the water molecules, and so do from 1% to 2%, from 12% to 15% and from 18% to 20%. DC then decreases gradually from P ¼ 10%, and reaches the critical dewetting distance of 1.2 nm in pure water at P ¼ 25%. This shows that the dewetting-promoting eﬀect only exists at low ethanol concentrations.
Now let us focus on the underlying physics. Since DC from 1.2 to 1.35 nm is signicantly larger than the D ¼ 0.8 nm needed for ethanol molecules to ll the space in pure ethanol (comparing Fig. 1(h) with Fig. 1(f)), one might wonder why not enough ethanol molecules move into the inter-plate region to occupy the open space. In any multiphase system, the equal chemical potentials determine the number of molecules in diﬀerent regions. In this case, we start our simulations with a uniform ethanol concentration everywhere, which is obviously a nonequilibrium system due to the nanoscale connement of the THPs. It is the MD simulation that brings the system from a non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium one. During this process, ethanol molecules move from higher chemical potentials to lower ones. In general, the chemical potential for introducing an extra ethanol molecule inside the THPs should have a higher value due to the nanoscale connement. Thus, it is unfavorable to accumulate more ethanol molecules inside the THPs during the competition for ethanol among various regions: in the bulk solution, on the outer surfaces of the THPs and in-between the THPs. Even as the initial ethanol concentration increases, there are indeed more ethanol molecules accumulating near the outer and inner surfaces of the THPs, but the inner THPs region is still less preferred due to its nanoconnement. As shown in Fig. 3, the number of ethanol molecules inside the THPs at equilibrium is below the linear ttingline if a uniform concentration is assumed from higher concentrations. Therefore, ethanol molecules in the bulk cannot freely move into the inter-plate region to occupy the open space even if more ethanol molecules are available in the bulk.
This can also be understood from another view point. We note that the adsorption potentials (similar to chemical potential) are diﬀerent for ethanol molecules adsorbed at diﬀerent positions in-between the THPs. Assuming all ethanol

Fig. 3 Number of ethanol molecules between the THPs versus the equilibrium concentration of the bulk solution at D ¼ 1.2 nm. The equilibrium concentration here is the ethanol concentration in the aqueous solutions after the system reached equilibrium. The dashed line is the ﬁtting-line for the number of ethanol molecules inside the THPs if a uniform concentration is assumed from higher concentrations, indicating that at lower concentrations ethanol molecules are less favored inside the THPs region due to the nano-conﬁnement.
molecules are in the bulk initially (non-equilibrium again), the ethanol molecules will be adsorbed into positions inside the THPs with the lowest adsorption potentials rst, and then to positions with higher adsorption potentials. It is clear that the nal equilibrium concentration of the ethanol molecules in the bulk solution and their average chemical potential determine how many ethanol molecules can move into the conned space, with the last ethanol molecule in the inter-plate region sharing the same chemical potential (or the highest adsorption potential). Vice versa, one can also conclude that the larger the number of ethanol molecules in-between the THPs is, the larger the equilibrium concentration of ethanol in solution is, as clearly seen in Fig. 3 where Nethanol increases with the equilibrium concentration of ethanol for all systems. Consequently, at too low concentrations, the space between the THPs cannot be completely lled by ethanol molecules, i.e. there is a depletion of ethanol molecules inside the THPs, although there are many in the bulk solution, due to the higher chemical potentials for the introduction of extra ethanol molecules in the conned space.
Then, why are water molecules more favored to be expelled from the inter-plate region at low ethanol concentrations, i.e. why does the critical distance increase? As shown in Fig. 1(h), we can see that ethanol prefers to stay at the liquid–vapor interface located at the edge of the THPs. Moreover, those ethanol molecules have preferred orientations with the –C2H5 groups pointing inward and the –OH groups pointing outward of the inter-plate core. This can be seen more clearly in Fig. 4. There is a clear ‘ethanol belt’ at the liquid–vapor interface (see Fig. 4(a)) with preferred orientations with the ethanol –C2H5 groups pointing inward and –OH groups pointing outward of the inter-plate core (see Fig. 4(c)). This ‘ethanol belt’ together with the orientation conguration makes it more diﬃcult for the water molecules to stay in the inter-plate core since the hydrophobic –C2H5 groups make the inner core between the THPs more hydrophobic, resulting in a lower mass density distribution of water at the inner core, as shown in Fig. 4(b). However, at too high ethanol concentrations (such as 20%), the

ethanol molecules at the “ethanol belt” and thus weaken the

4 Conclusions
In this study, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of two hydrophobic plates (THPs) immersed in ethanol aqueous solutions to study the dewetting transition. We observe that the addition of a small amount of ethanol to water promotes the dewetting transition; this is unexpected and counter-intuitive. Our analyses show that ethanol molecules prefer to be adsorbed at the liquid–vapor interfaces. The number of ethanol molecules adsorbed in the nanoscale conned space depends on the equilibrium concentration of the bulk ethanol aqueous solution. The competition for ethanol molecules among diﬀerent regions, in-between the THPs, the outer surfaces of the THPs and in the bulk solution, results in a depletion of ethanol molecules in the inter-plate region due to their nano-connement induced higher chemical potential for extra ethanol molecules. Meanwhile, the specic orientations of the ethanol molecules at the liquid–vapor interface make the hydrophobic inter-plate core more hydrophobic due to the existence of ethyl groups. Our observations provide a deeper understanding of the dewetting behavior in cosolvent solutions under nanoscale connement, including those in nanodevices and biosystems.
