Abstract The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the prototypic member of the ‘Cys-loop’ superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels which mediate synaptic neurotransmission, and whose other members include receptors for glycine, γ -aminobutyric acid and serotonin. Cryo-electron microscopy has yielded a three-dimensional structure of the nAChR in its closed state. However, the exact nature and location of the channel gate remains uncertain. Although the transmembrane pore is constricted close to its center, it is not completely occluded. Rather, the pore has a central hydrophobic zone of radius about 3 A˚ . Model calculations suggest that such a constriction may form a hydrophobic gate, preventing movement of ions through a channel. We present a detailed and quantitative simulation study of the hydrophobic gating model of the nicotinic receptor, in order to fully evaluate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that the hydrophobic constriction of the nAChR pore indeed forms a closed gate. Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations reveal that the constriction presents a barrier of height about 10 kT to the permeation of sodium ions, placing an upper bound on the closed channel conductance of 0.3 pS. Thus, a 3 A˚ radius hydrophobic pore can form a functional barrier to the permeation of a 1 A˚ radius Na+ ion. Using a united-atom force ﬁeld for the protein instead of an all-atom one retains the qualitative features but results in differing conductances, showing that the PMF is sensitive to the detailed molecular interactions.

1. Introduction
The mechanism of gating of ion channels is a central problem in membrane protein biophysics. One class of channel for which structural and biochemical data are available is the one containing the ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC3), represented by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor

(nAChR). This cation-selective channel is made up from ﬁve homologous subunits (α2βγ δ in muscle type receptors) packed around a central pore, forming a structure with ﬁvefold pseudo-symmetry [1]. Cryo-electron microscopy studies of the Torpedo nAChR [2, 3] have revealed three domains: an extracellular domain containing the neurotransmitter binding site; a transmembrane (TM) domain forming a pore across the lipid bilayer; and an intracellular domain providing binding sites for cytoskeletal proteins (ﬁgure 1(A)).
The structure of the extracellular ligand-binding domain is homologous to that of a water-soluble acetylcholine binding protein [4]. Each subunit of the TM domain contains four

(A) Overall architecture of the nAChR (PDB id 2BG9) as determined by cryo-electron microscopy [3], showing the extracellular (EC), transmembrane (TM) and intracellular (IC) domains and the surface of the pore (calculated with HOLE [7]). The position of the gate is currently intensely debated, with some evidence pointing to the region of the hydrophobic girdle (1) and other experiments indicating the constriction close to the intracellular domain (2). The horizontal lines indicate the approximate location of the lipid bilayer. The M2 helices are colored by subunit: α (red), γ (yellow), δ (cyan); the β subunit is omitted for clarity but shown in black in the top view below.

membrane-spanning helices, M1 to M4. The ﬁve M2 helices come together to form an approximately symmetrical TM pore (ﬁgure 1(B)). The lower (intracellular) half of the pore is formed by a polar 3 A˚ constriction (lined by serine and threonine residues), whilst the upper (extracellular) half of the pore contains a more hydrophobic constriction of the same radius, lined mainly by valine and leucine residues. The protein was crystallized in the absence of acetylcholine; thus the receptor is presumed to be in a functionally closed state. Despite this, the narrowest zone of the pore is sufﬁciently wide to accommodate e.g. three water molecules or a Na+ ion and two water molecules side by side. Thus, there is an

apparent paradox of a functionally closed pore which is not fully occluded. This contrasts with e.g. the structure of the bacterial K+ channel KirBac1.1 [5] where the putative gate has a radius of 0.5 A˚ , thus sterically occluding the ion passageway. However, the situation is already less clear-cut for KcsA [6], another bacterial K channel, whose gate constriction is just wide enough to admit a bare potassium ion. Interestingly, those constrictions are also formed by hydrophobic residues.
A possible answer to the paradox lies in the concept of the hydrophobic gating of ion channels, which has been postulated in the literature [10–14] and was quantitatively developed on the basis of computer simulations of simpliﬁed pore models [15–17]. A hydrophobic gate is a constriction that acts as a desolvation barrier for ions. It is so narrow (pore radius R < 4 A˚ ) that an ion has to shed at least some water molecules from its hydration shell in order to pass the constriction. Because this requires a large amount of free energy (the solvation free energy for a potassium ion is about −308 kJ mol−1 and for a sodium ion it is −391 kJ mol−1 [18]), passage of the ion is energetically unfavorable and thus blocked, even though the geometry would permit permeation of a partially hydrated ion or a water molecule. The desolvation barrier is only effective if hydration shell water molecules cannot be temporarily substituted with e.g. hydroxyl groups from side chains or the protein backbone as seen, for instance, in the narrow (R ≈ 1.5 A˚ ) selectivity ﬁlter of K channels [6, 19]. Thus, the constriction has to be lined by hydrophobic side chains, whose methyl groups will not participate in solvating an ion. According to the electron microscopy structure [2] and biochemical studies [21, 22], the central portion of the nAChR pore is lined by valine and leucine side chains. Analysis of Cys-loop receptor M2 sequences in terms of sequence logos [20], shown in ﬁgure 2, reveals that the LxxxVxxxV/L motif is well conserved amongst nAChR receptors (residues 9 , 13 and 17 when numbered from the N-terminal end of the M2 helix),

and is replaced by an equivalent LxxxVxxxI motif in 5HT3 receptors [21, 23–25], hinting at the biological importance of these hydrophobic residues. There is also evidence that a similar motif is conserved in prokaryotic homologues of the nAChR [26], suggesting that this was an early evolutionary feature of this family of ion channels. Here we argue that these hydrophobic residues form a hydrophobic gate (called the ‘hydrophobic girdle’ by White and Cohen [10] and later Unwin and colleagues [2, 11]). In GABA and glycine receptors the LxxxVxxxV/L motif is replaced by a LxxxT motif (residues 9 and 13 ), suggesting that the nature of the gate may be modiﬁed in anion-selective channels.
However, the position of the gate is highly contentious, with different experiments pointing toward different locations (see ﬁgure 1). As discussed below, some studies employing methods probing the accessibility of pore lining residues ﬁnd the gate close to the intracellular end of the pore [22, 27–30] whereas the EM structure [2] and the same accessibility method applied to 5HT3R [31] point to the hydrophobic girdle as the gate; other mutation studies in LGIC point to the importance of the ring of conserved Leu and Val residues, suggesting a gate closer to the extracellular end of the pore [25, 32–36]. Knowing the position of the gate is crucial in the larger enterprise of understanding the full gating behavior of the ligand gated ion channels as a paradigm for a complex receptor structure-function relationship [37]. The simulations presented in this work are answering the question whether a hydrophobic girdle (as seen in the EM structure) could act as a barrier to ion permeation and provide quantitative evidence for the qualitative idea of a hydrophobic gate.
For the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the concept of hydrophobic gating has already been investigated using molecular dynamics computer simulations. Anishkin and Sukharev [38] conclude that the crystal structure, which exhibits a hydrophobic constriction of radius 4 A˚ [39], represents a closed state because water (and ions) do not enter the putative gate; Spronk et al [40] challenge this view because in their simulations both ion and water ﬁll the pore once an external transmembrane potential is applied across the channel. Continuum electrostatics calculations on a simpliﬁed model of KcsA [12] and the crystal structure [41, 42] indicate that the intracellular hydrophobic constriction presents a high dielectric barrier even though it does not sterically occlude the ion pathway. Recent continuum electrostatics [43] and short equilibrium MD and Brownian dynamics calculations [44] suggest that hydrophobic gating may also apply to nAChR. However, comparisons with estimates of free energy proﬁles for ion permeation through model pores based on atomistic simulations [17] showed that continuum approximations can be inaccurate for pores of sub-nanometer dimensions, especially when hydrophobic effects (which are collective effects of the solvent) are involved. Thus, such methods cannot readily provide a rigorous test of the hydrophobic gating hypothesis. Furthermore, equilibrium simulations can only show what would happen under equilibrium conditions within the time span of the simulation (i.e. 1–100 ns, this time scale still being perhaps three orders of magnitude short of that of channel gating). For instance, for an open state conductance

of 50 pS as typical for nAChR [13] one would expect on average about one ion permeation event per about 60 ns in equilibrium (using rate theory to estimate the equilibrium ﬂux: start from the rate theory ﬂux = I /q ≈ 0 sinh(qV /2kT ) [16], expand near equilibrium, i.e. vanishing driving potential qV kT , and using I = gV arrive at a rough estimate for the equilibrium ﬂux 0 ≈ 2kT gq−2 = 0.016 ns−1 or one ion per 63 ns). For a closed gate the time for such an event to occur would be at least one order of magnitude larger. This means that it is impossible to quantify any sizable energy barriers, such as that in a closed gate, using straightforward equilibrium MD. In order to probe such a region, i.e. to estimate reliably the height and extent of the energy barrier to ion permeation in the nAChR pore, and thus to test the hydrophobic gating hypothesis, detailed atomistic free energy calculations are required. Although those ‘potential of mean force’ calculations are computationally expensive, there are a number of comparable simulations that have been used to determine quantitatively the energy landscape experienced by K+ ions within the selectivity ﬁlter of KcsA [19] and the gramicidin A (gA) pore [45–47].
We present the results of such calculations for the height of the energetic barrier associated with the closed gate of the nAChR, and show that they support the hydrophobic gating hypothesis. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of this conclusion in relation to the forceﬁeld employed. These results demonstrate the value of a theoretical physical approach to a mechanistic biological problem that is difﬁcult to address via direct experimentation.
2. Methods
In order to determine the equilibrium distribution and the potentials of mean force of water and ions within the pore of the nAChR, we employed fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the pore-forming M2 helix bundle, embedded within a membrane-mimetic slab of methane-like pseudoatoms, with water and ions (Na+ and Cl−) equivalent to a concentration of 1.3 M on either side of the slab (ﬁgure 3).
2.1. Model
The initial model of the M2 bundle consists of residues αE241 to αV271 (and corresponding residues on the other chains) from the 4 A˚ resolution cryo-EM structure (PDB id 1OED [2]). All titratable residues are in their default (charged) state at pH 7 (as predicted by pKa calculations on the whole TM domain using WHATIF [48, 49] with DELPHI [50] as the Poisson–Boltzmann solver) except for the helix termini, which were kept neutral to minimize their inﬂuence on the system. The M2 bundle is embedded in a bilayer-mimetic slab of thickness 3.2 nm, made from CH4 molecules, which are held on a face-centered cubic lattice (cubic lattice constant 0.75 nm) by harmonic restraints of strength k0 = 1000 kJ mol−1 nm−2. The total system size was 15 298 atoms, made up of 2819 protein atoms, 2974 water molecules, 689 ‘membrane’ CH4 molecules and 112 ions. The pore was initially solvated with water. Cations and anions were added alternately by

exchanging a water molecule at the position of minimum potential energy for the ion, leading to an approximately uniform distribution of ions. For the protein and CH4 the OPLS all-atom force ﬁeld [51] was used, but for a sensitivity analysis we also performed simulations with the united-atom GROMOS96 force ﬁeld [52]. For water the SPC model was employed [53], and ion parameters were taken from the work of A˚ qvist [54]. During the simulations, the protein backbone was harmonically restrained with force constant k0 whilst the side chain atoms, water and ions were free to move, resulting in positional root mean square ﬂuctuations (average Cα ﬂuctuation 0.3 A˚ ) similar to those seen in simulations of the TM helix bundle in a lipid bilayer [55] (about 0.6 A˚ , excluding mobile loops).
2.2. Simulation details
Simulations were performed with GROMACS 3.2.1 [56] at constant temperature (300 K or 27 ◦C) and pressure (1 bar) normal to the membrane, using weak temperature (time constant τ = 0.1 ps) and pressure coupling (τ = 1 ps) algorithms. Electrostatic interactions were accounted for by a particle mesh Ewald method [57] (real space cutoff 1 nm, grid spacing 0.15 nm, fourth order interpolation), whereas

The N and C termini of the helices (corresponding to the intracellular and extracellular ends of the transbilayer pore respectively) and the hydrophobic gate are labeled. The three surfaces show the average density of water molecules (gray surface, contoured at 95% of the bulk density), sodium ions (blue surface), and chloride ions (red surface), both contoured at 0.1 M. These are taken from a 60 ns simulation on the M2 helix bundle embedded in a membrane-mimetic slab and bathed in a 1.3 M NaCl solution. The inset shows a cross-section through the water density in the region of the gate. The water density is contoured on a color scale, ranging from 5% (deep blue) to 140% (deep red) of bulk density.

van der Waals interactions were computed within a cutoff of 1.4 nm. Protein bonds were constrained with the LINCS algorithm [58] whereas the SPC water molecule bonds were constrained with SETTLE [59]. The MD time step was 2 fs.
The equilibrium simulation in the OPLS-AA force ﬁeld was performed for 60 ns; GROMOS96 equilibrium simulations were run for 80 ns. The single-channel conductance under physiological conditions of the (open) Torpedo nAChR is 30–50 pS [13], corresponding to an equilibrium mean passage time per ion of about 60 ns. Thus, as mentioned in the introduction, a 60 ns simulation should enable us to sample the distribution of ions within an M2 bundle pore if it were permeable to ions (though in any case one would not expect to observe permeation events).
Potentials of mean force. Potentials of mean force (PMF) for permeant species were obtained from a combination of equilibrium and umbrella sampling [60, 61] simulations. A

starting conﬁguration for each umbrella window was obtained
from the equilibrium simulation by selecting a frame from
the trajectory that had a particle of interest within about 1 A˚ of the window center, or by exchanging a suitable
water molecule with an ion. Thus neighboring window
conﬁgurations tend not to be correlated. For umbrella
sampling, the particle of interest was harmonically restrained
to subsequent positions on the channel axis (with typical values of the restraining force constant 1558 kJ mol−1 nm−2) in 101 or more windows of width z = 0.396 A˚ for Na+, Cl−, and water (see table S1 in the supplementary
data available at stacks.iop.org/PhysBio/3/147 for a detailed
listing of umbrella sampling parameters). This choice of
umbrella sampling parameters allows the particle of interest
to diffuse into neighboring windows (the energy required to
do so is only about 1.5 kT , i.e. a typical thermal ﬂuctuation),
leading to good overlap between windows [45]. Each window
simulation was typically run for 1.2 ns, with the initial 0.2 ns
being discarded as equilibration time; hence a single PMF
comprises 101 ns of simulation time or about 50 million
conﬁgurations of the sampled particle (at a simulation time step of 2 fs). The umbrella sampling simulations for Na+ with
the OPLS force ﬁeld were extended into the bulk regions with a
harmonic ﬂat-bottomed cylindrical conﬁnement potential [46] (radius 1.3 nm, force constant 4500 kJ mol−1 nm−2). 25 windows were added on the intracellular side ( z = 0.4 A˚ , k = 1527 kJ mol−1 nm−2) and 20 on the extracellular side ( z = 0.5 A˚ , k = 977 kJ mol−1 nm−2), so that the Na+ PMF comprises of 146 windows over a length of 60 A˚ .
Resulting histograms were unbiased using the weighted
histogram analysis method [62] (WHAM), with 300–500 bins and a tolerance of 10−5 kT for the individual window offsets.
The PMFs are converged with respect to the number of bins and
the tolerance; more details can be found in the supplementary
data available at stacks.iop.org/PhysBio/3/147. PMFs were
constructed from matching the umbrella-sampled PMF to the
PMF derived from the equilibrium density (i.e. the Boltzmann-
sampled PMF)

in the mouth regions of the pore (n(z) denoting the average

density in the pore along the z-axis and n0 the density in the bulk, C being an undetermined constant not relevant for our

discussion). Both methods produce overlapping results in the

mouth region, even though combining them is not a rigorously

deﬁned operation (see below).

Many ion channel properties are discussed in terms of the

one-dimensional PMF along a single reaction coordinate (also

referred to as the free energy proﬁle) [13]. However, as Roux

et al [63] point out, there are a number of theoretical/

conceptual and practical problems associated with the free

energy proﬁle. It is only well deﬁned in the pore region because

in the bulk the motion of the particle is not bounded orthogonal

to the reaction coordinate (although in MD simulations

periodic boundary conditions ensure artiﬁcial conﬁnement).

Practically, one can umbrella-sample into the bulk/mouth

regions with the help of a cylindrical conﬁnement potential.

This procedure was employed for the OPLS Na+ PMF and

resulted in a better converged PMF. On the practical side, one cannot hope to sample the full multi-ion PMF because all movements of ions are ‘slow’ degrees of freedom. With a 1D reaction coordinate approach only one slow degree of freedom (such as the movement in z-direction) can be controlled; the other slow degrees will not equilibrate on the time scale of the umbrella sampling simulation and therefore should be controlled by other means (see [63] for a full discussion). A well-deﬁned quantity is the one-ion PMF, which is obtained as the PMF of one particular ion while no other ions are present in the pore. From the one-ion PMF one can, for instance, compute the maximum single channel conductance, equation 2. If the other ions are not excluded from the pore by a computational device such as an exclusion potential [45, 47] one can resort to only including those frames of a trajectory in the WHAM analysis during which the one-ion condition is fulﬁlled. The latter approach was chosen for the OPLS Na+ PMF. The one-ion region P1 was deﬁned as −21.6 A˚ z 6.4 A˚ (roughly corresponding to the region between the 1 and the 17 positions; see ﬁgures 5 and 7) on the basis that the ionic equilibrium densities (ﬁgure 5) drop sharply inside this region and, that after analysis of umbrella windows, only 14 out of 72 windows showed multiple ion occupancies in this region. Those windows were simply rerun after exchanging the offending ion(s) with a bulk water or after assigning new initial velocities. Both approaches yielded simulations with only the sampled ion in P1. (Details can be found in the supplementary data available at stacks.iop.org/PhysBio/3/147.)
We also calculated a PMF across the whole pore by including the additional windows outside P1. Although this is not a rigorous approach, it turns out that including the multiple-occupancy regions in the WHAM procedure does not alter the one-ion part of the PMF. Because WHAM is a rather sensitive ‘global’ ﬁtting procedure this gives at least an indication that our PMFs are reasonably robust quantities, even without the full rigorous treatment. The Boltzmann-sampled PMF is by deﬁnition the multi-ion PMF (though it might not be converged); our umbrella-sampled PMF contains multi-ion components in the mouth region and the one-ion PMF in P1. We join those two PMFs because they tend to overlap rather well in the mouth regions of the pore and because the umbrellasampled PMF for water superimposes almost exactly on the Boltzmann-sampled one (which can easily be sampled across the whole pore) as shown in ﬁgure 7.
2.3. Analysis
Simulations. Pore radius proﬁles were calculated with HOLE [7] from the cryo-EM structure with a probe radius of 0.14 nm.
To address the question of the existence of a vaporlock mechanism we analyzed the water occupancy Nwater of the hydrophobic constriction (at 13 , −2.6 A˚ z 1.6 A, see ﬁgures 5 and 7) from the 60 ns equilibrium simulation. This region was chosen after preliminary inspection showed intermittent vapor phases only occurring in this 4.2 A˚ section of the pore, reminiscent of results from our previous work on hydrophobic model pores [15, 64].

where the averages are carried out over the pore region
P1 where only one ion occupies the pore. The diffusion coefﬁcients in the pore were estimated to be half of the experimental bulk value [65] (Dbulk (Na+) = 1.33 nm2 ns−1, Dbulk (Cl−) = 2.03 nm2 ns−1 [13]). This gmax estimate is strictly true only for one-ion channels (or one-ion PMFs). In addition to P1 we also deﬁne the barrier region Pb, −23 A˚ z 10 A˚ (E−2 to E20 ), which is the extent of the barrier in the Na+ PMF (see ﬁgure 7). The one-ion condition is not
strictly fulﬁlled but because of the robustness of the one-ion
PMF we use the PMF over PB as an approximation for the proper one-ion PMF and calculate gmax across the full barrier. (Because gmax depends on L−2 we use the exact same deﬁnition for the pore regions for all our simulations in order to compare
the conductance estimates.)

Sequences. An alignment of the transmembrane domain of the ligand gated ion channels was prepared, based on the Pfam (‘protein family’) PF02932 (neurotransmitter-gated ionchannel transmembrane region), which contains 616 members (version 14.0 of Pfam [66]). After removal of fragmentary sequences, 511 remained, which were aligned with CLUSTALW [67]. A calculation of an average-distance neighbor joining tree (using JALVIEW [68]) shows four distinct families (nAChR, 5HT3R, GABAAR, GlyR) for the whole alignment. Focusing on the M2 region three distinct families remain: cationselective nAChR (234 sequences) and 5HT3R (20 sequences), and anion-selective GABA/GlyR (244 sequences). From the M2 sequences, ‘sequence logos’ [20] were created.

3. Results and discussion
The long 60 ns equilibrium simulation reveals that although water penetrates the full length of the pore, ions do not (ﬁgures 4(A) and 5). Instead there is a local increase (up to 6×) in the concentration of cations at the extracellular mouth of the pore. This reﬂects the presence of rings of negatively charged aspartate and glutamate residues at the mouths of the M2 helix bundle (at the 20 and 24 positions), as can be seen in ﬁgures 4(B) and 2. By increasing the local ion concentration near the channel entrance, the charged rings lower the effective access resistance and so increase the single-channel current once the pore opens [13].
Ions fail to enter the central hydrophobic section of the M2 pore: at a bulk concentration of 1.3 M NaCl, the ionic density in the gate drops to less than 0.1 M during 60 ns of equilibrium MD. This is consistent with the hydrophobic gating hypothesis. However, a 60 ns duration equilibrium simulation cannot sample the distribution of ions over an energy barrier of greater than about 5 kT reliably. Thus, umbrella sampling simulations are needed to estimate the barrier height and exact position of the residues responsible for the barrier (see below).
3.1. Water in the hydrophobic constriction
The presence of the peptide backbone makes the nAChR pore signiﬁcantly more polar than hydrophobic model pores studied in our previous simulations [16, 17, 64]. It is, therefore, not surprising that water is seen all along the pore (ﬁgure 5). The putative gate region around αV13 (region c in ﬁgure 5) is of particular interest, in that the water density is localized in an approximately pentameric arrangement, forming a hollow tube with, on average, little water in the center (inset of ﬁgure 4(A)). This hints at strong constraints on water positions: water may only maintain its presence if it interacts in a fairly restricted conﬁguration. Inspection of the trajectory reveals that the pentameric distribution only emerges on averaging. It does not reﬂect structures such

as highly ordered ﬁve-membered rings. On occasions, a hydrogen-bonded string of water molecules can be seen to sample the preferred locations, although mostly the pore is simply water ﬁlled (also see ﬁgure S4 and the movie available at stacks.iop.org/PhysBio/3/147). In MD simulations of water in MscS, extended vapor phases with some intermittent water ﬁlling were observed in the putative gate region [38, 40, 69]. Partly on this basis, Anishkin and Sukharev [38] concluded that the MscS structure represents a closed state and hypothesized that a similar ‘vapor-lock’ mechanism might be at work in nAChR. As ﬁgure 6 shows, the number of water molecules in the constriction ﬂuctuates between zero and nine over 60 ns. For 75% of the time, the hydrophobic constriction is ﬁlled with two to nine water molecules and for 19% it is void of water (and as such our results are more similar to what Sotomayor and Schulten [69] found for water in the MscS hydrophobic constriction). The distribution in the lower panel of ﬁgure 6 resembles data obtained for hydrophobic model pores [64]; in particular, it is bi-modal with a metastable vapor-like state (Nwater = 0) and a stable liquid-like state (Nwater > 1). (In the supplementary data available at stacks.iop.org/PhysBio/3/147 we discuss the hydrophobic constriction as a simple hydrophobic nano pore.) These data indicate that extended vapor phases are not responsible for blocking ionic current, simply because those phases are not sufﬁciently stable. Nevertheless, the appearance of a vapor state is an indicator of the hydrophobic nature of the pore, which, as we will demonstrate below, in itself can already be sufﬁcient to create a desolvation barrier for Na+.
3.2. Position of the gate
From the water equilibrium distribution it is possible to estimate (via a Boltzmann transformation, equation (1)) a free energy proﬁle (i.e. PMF) for water along the pore axis. This direct estimate coincides exceptionally well with the PMF obtained by umbrella sampling (see ﬁgure 7(A)). Water molecules do not encounter signiﬁcant barriers (the highest

The dashed line is the PMF for a water molecule in the pore, derived from the density of one 60 ns equilibrium simulation (equation 1). The intracellular end of the M2 pore is at z ≈ −25 A˚ and the extracellular end is at z ≈ +15 A˚ . The putative gate region runs from ≈ −9 A˚ to +5 A˚ (marked by the yellow band).

one is 2kT at the central residue αV255 of the hydrophobic girdle), again indicating that the closed-state nAChR pore is largely water ﬁlled. Because a vapor-lock mechanism of gating does not seem to be an accurate description, a more detailed investigation of the energetics of ion permeation such as the full PMFs of the ions is required.
The same umbrella sampling procedure can be used to obtain PMFs for ions (both Na+ and Cl−) along the pore axis (ﬁgure 7(A)). Na+ ions encounter a signiﬁcant barrier of about 10.5 kT . An estimate of the single-channel conductance for Na+, based on the PMF (equation 2), yields gmax = 0.33 pS (table 1). This is much lower than the experimentally observed open state conductance of 30 pS to 50 pS [13]. In fact, the conductance for the whole channel would be even smaller as our estimate does not include the resistance encountered in other regions of the receptor and the access resistance at the mouths [70]. As our computed ggmax for sodium, which is an upper bound on the true single channel conductance, is already much smaller than the (experimental) open state conductance we conclude that the M2 pore appears impermeable to Na+ and hence represents a closed conformation. The barrier

for sodium is wide, ranging over the complete length of the hydrophobic girdle, which we identify with the gate. Thus, the hydrophobic gate may be thought of as being distributed from the αL251 to the αV259 side chain rings. The peak of the barrier coincides with a very narrow (radius 3 A˚ —see ﬁgure 7(C)) and hydrophobic (αV255) region of the pore but the width of the barrier is mainly due to αL251, which lines the central part of the nAChR pore.
A previous study computed Poisson–Boltzmann continuum electrostatic solvation free energy proﬁles across the nAChR gate region (using the full transmembrane domain) in order to assess the inﬂuence of changing pore geometry on ion transport properties [55]. For the cryo-EM-like conﬁguration the results differ somewhat from the fully atomistic, explicit solvent PMF (ﬁgure 7(A)). Notably, the solvation free energy proﬁle shows three peaks at S248, L251 and V255, with the V255 peak being the smallest. This discrepancy is not surprising and rather points to the inherent (and well known [63, 71]) limitations of the continuum approach, namely a very strong dependence on small pore radii (which will dominate the result if computed from a single structure), and the omission of hydrophobic destabilization of the solvent in apolar regions [16].
Chloride ions encounter a less pronounced barrier of about 6.5 kT , which is also peaked at the hydrophobic girdle. In the case of the Cl− PMF shown in ﬁgure 7(A) the upperbound estimate on gmax is rather large with a value of 21 pS (table 1) because the barriers are not very high and not very wide. According to the PMF, the central cavity (formed mainly by L9 ) can stabilize a solvated Cl− ion but not a solvated Na+. It is somewhat surprising that the negatively charged rings (20 and 24 , called the extracellular ring [72]) do not contribute to any appreciable barrier for Cl− even though one might expect strong repulsion between anions and the negatively charged glutamates or aspartates. The simulations show that all the negative charge (−6e) is effectively screened by Na+ ions (ﬁgure 5) so that, on average, the ions form a double layer protruding into the mouth region, with a cloud of cations enveloping the anions as shown by the 3D density in ﬁgure 4(A). This picture is consistent with the fact that charge selectivity is not conferred by the extracellular ring but rather by the so-called intermediate ring at −2 [72–75]. The PMF, however, does not exhibit a barrier near −2 . This is due to the fact that we truncated our model at −2 and that the whole

intracellular domain of nAChR is missing from our model. Selectivity requires charged groups protruding into a conﬁned environment [76] but the −2 residues are exposed to the bulk in our simulations so that their effect is effectively screened. It should also be noted that the Cl− PMF was constructed from umbrella windows that included multi-ion conﬁgurations in the pore, and hence does not constitute a true one-ion PMF. Judging from the analysis of the Na+ PMF the difference is unlikely to be more than a moderate increase in barrier height by 1 to 2kT .
Allen et al [47] suggest a number of corrections to fully atomistic PMFs, which include the effect of polarization of the surrounding lipid hydrocarbon chains and a correction for the ﬁnite (but periodic) system size. In the case of gA, those corrections lowered the PMF by a few kT [46, 47]. An additional source of uncertainty is the absence of the outer helices (M1, M3, M4) and the intra- and extracellular domain from our model. For a model of the α7 nAChR we showed that the barriers in a continuum electrostatic free energy proﬁle almost doubled once the ligand binding domain and the outer TM helices were added to the M2 bundle [77], essentially due to an expansion of the low dielectric environment experienced by the ion. Because we are primarily interested in pinpointing the gate, the absolute value of the PMF (which is needed for accurate gmax estimates) is less important than the shape and relative heights. The latter will be less affected by uniformly applied corrections such as the ones discussed above, so that we will still be able to relate the peaks in the PMF to the residues responsible for the barrier. (It is still necessary to compute the PMF with all-atom simulations with explicit solvent and correct long range electrostatics as this is the only method that accounts for all effects (except for polarizability) that are important in conﬁned geometries [17, 63].)
3.3. Sensitivity analysis
We have tested the sensitivity of the fundamental result, namely that the L251–V255–V259 side chain rings produce a hydrophobic gate in the closed state of the nAChR channel, to a number of factors. The proﬁles presented in ﬁgure 7(A) were calculated using the OPLS all-atom forceﬁeld [51]. We have repeated the umbrella sampling simulations with the unitedatom GROMOS96 forceﬁeld [52] (ﬁgure 8): the PMFs share the same qualitative features such as the peak of the barrier at αV255 but the absolute values shift. The Na+ peak height reduces to about 7kT and the barrier at the lower constriction site becomes more pronounced. The united-atom Cl− PMF is higher than the all-atom one (about 10kT ). Consequently, the gmax estimates (equation 2) differ substantially as shown in table 1. The sensitivity of PMFs to the force ﬁeld has also been noted in the case of gA [45, 47].
Our calculations are based on a medium-resolution cryoEM derived model [2]. Thus the coordinates of the M2 helix bundle are not known with the same precision as from e.g. an x-ray structure. However, based on the simulations by Hung et al [55], relaxing the TM2 structure results in a pore with a radius >2.5 A˚ so even though the resolution is only 4 A˚ , the pore (of radius about 3 A˚ ) is most likely not an artifact of

the lower resolution and it is always wide enough to admit an ion without physical occlusion. In the cryo-EM model, pore lining residues only interact with the solvent in the pore and their M2 neighbors (as the M2 bundle sits rather loosely in the outer M1/M3/M4 scaffold). Thus, from the perspective of our simulations, restraining the backbone atoms should be sufﬁcient to enable sidechains to relax into their most favorable positions.
To assess the inﬂuence of the backbone restraints we also calculated the Na+ PMF based on simulations with a 5× weaker restraint on the M2 backbone atoms, thus allowing for an enhanced degree of protein ﬂexibility (GROMOS96 forceﬁeld). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone atoms, averaged over 80 ns of simulation, is 0.653 ± 0.029 A˚ for the weaker restraints compared to 0.388 ± 0.014 A˚ for the standard restraints. The RMSD of the side chain atoms is 2.16 ± 0.07 A˚ (weak restraints) and 2.48 ± 0.11 A˚ , which is of the same magnitude as the side chain RMSD between the weak and standard restraint simulations (2.05 A˚ ), i.e. in both simulations the sidechains are free to explore a similar range of conformations. We observed no signiﬁcant change in the shape of the PMF (ﬁgure 8) and the conductances are reasonably similar (table 1).
We have also investigated the robustness of our results against small changes in the structural model of the nAChR pore domain. Thus, previous preliminary calculations of a Na+ ion PMF for the M2 bundle of a homology model of the chick α7 nAChR [77] yielded a barrier of height between 8 and 12 kT distributed along the entire TM pore region with gmax = 0.02 pS.
Thus the qualitative features of the Na+ PMF are robust against small changes in sequence and in atomic coordinates. This is an important consideration given the resolution upon which the calculations are based. The Cl− PMF differs more noticeably between the two force ﬁelds, which might indicate some subtle difference in how solvation effects in conﬁned geometries are treated differently by an all-atom force ﬁeld (OPLS-AA) versus an united-atom one (GROMOS96).

Allen et al [45] compared an all-atom force ﬁeld (CHARMM PARAM27) and a united-atom force ﬁeld (GROMACS) for PMF calculations of the gA channel. This study (in conjunction with subsequent ones [46, 47]) seems to indicate that all-atom force ﬁelds are more successful at describing ion permeation in gA. Apparently, the same conclusion also holds for nAChR.
3.4. Comparison with experimental data
All the preceding results are based on the assumption that the structure of the transmembrane domain of nAChR [2] faithfully represents the closed state. In fact, nAChR and the other LGIC do not only have one closed (resting) state but also a closed desensitized state [78] and Karlin and coworkers ﬁnd that the gate is in different positions in these two closed states [28, 29]. The cryo-EM images were taken in the absence of ACh [2] so the EM structure is likely to represent the closed resting state as desensitization requires prolonged exposure to agonist; such exposure to the agonist analog carbamylcholine resulted in low resolution structures different from the presumed resting-closed state [79]. All EM images were taken from tubular 2D crystals, which retain the physiological environment of the receptor: lipid composition and packing of receptors are close to the situation in the postsynaptic membrane of the muscle-derived electric organ of the Torpedo ray and the curvature of the tubular crystals is similar to the one of the folds in the neuromuscular junction [2, 80–82]. In addition, the channel in those 2D crystals could be rapidly converted to the open state through the application of the agonist ACh [81], which requires that the initial state was the resting-closed state [37]. Hence it appears unlikely that the cryo-EM structure represents a desensitized or other un-physiological states of the receptor. The resolution of the structure is not very high at 4 A˚ —just good enough to trace the backbone with some conﬁdence. But assuming that the backbone is correctly described, the MD simulations allow the side chains to re-arrange themselves. Because the PMF

155

is not sensitive to the strength of the backbone restraints it follows that the local pore environment, which is formed by the mobile side chains, assumes a conformation independent of the details of the backbone motions.
The Na+ PMF (ﬁgure 7) shows a pronounced barrier of about 10.5 kT at the hydrophobic girdle (between αL251 = 9 and αV255 = 13 ) and results in a very small maximum single-channel conductance. Therefore, the hydrophobic girdle is identiﬁed with the hydrophobic gate of nAChR, as hypothesized by Unwin and colleagues [2, 83], who based their inference on the protein structure.
This ﬁnding disagrees with the results of Karlin and coworkers [22, 27–29] who predict the position of the (resting) gate at about αT244 = 2 , based on biochemical data (accessibility of substituted cysteines to small, positively charged, sulfhydryl-speciﬁc reagents such as methanethiosulphonates). However, using the same method in the closely related 5HT3A receptor, Panicker et al [31] ﬁnd evidence for a gate between residues 9 and 13 , and further experiments indicate that the narrow constriction site near 2 remains unchanged between the open and the closed state [84]—the very same region that Karlin et al [22, 27–29] identify as the gate. Thus, either the gate location varies between different members of the same superfamily of ligand gated ion channels, or the methodology is sensitive to other changes in receptor properties. Paas et al [30], using Zn2+ binding to engineered His metal binding sites, report evidence that they interpret as ruling out a hydrophobic gating mechanism.
The free energy proﬁles for Na+ and Cl− do not allow us to explain the results of experiments ﬁnding the gate near or below the 2 position as we cannot simply extrapolate from monovalent ions to the reactive reagents such as Zn2+ or the methanethiosulphonates. Further simulations would be required to investigate how those reagents could penetrate the hydrophobic girdle in the closed state while being excluded by the narrow constriction near 2 . In addition, one would need to assess the inﬂuence of the mutations to Cys or His on the channel behavior. The major hurdle in computationally addressing these experiments in a similar manner as presented here is the design of force ﬁeld parameters describing the reactive reagents in a satisfactory manner.
4. Conclusion and outlook
In summary, we have shown that the hydrophobic girdle at the center of the nAChR M2 pore (as given by the cryo-electron microscopy structure) acts as a hydrophobic gate. This is in line with recent equilibrium simulations by Corry [44] and our own previous preliminary results for the related α7 receptor [77]. However, it should be noted that the current work rather robustly quantiﬁes the free energy barriers to ion permeation (i.e. it includes explicit entropic and solvation effects in addition to direct particle interactions) and assesses the inﬂuence of choices in the computational method, namely the force ﬁeld and the setup of the M2 helix bundle. In trying to evaluate the hydrophobic gating hypothesis, it is important that a quantitative and robust procedure be employed. In

particular, the accuracy of our calculations is limited only by accuracy of the force ﬁeld (not by e.g. modeling the water inside the pore after water in the bulk state, which we know to be a poor approximation [64, 85]) and the structure of the channel. The cryo-EM structure [2] is the most accurate atomistic description of a LGIC that is presently available. Our results demonstrate that if the nicotinic receptor adopts a conformation as seen in the 4 A˚ structure then (1) it will block the ﬂow of Na+ ions, and (2) it will gate them at the hydrophobic girdle, and not at the lower constriction site.
The opening of the hydrophobic gate is the ﬁnal step in the full gating transition, which involves binding of two ligands, communicating a conformational change to the transmembrane domain and movement of the M2 helices [2, 55, 86] so as to increase the pore radius from about 3 A˚ to probably not more than 6.5 A˚ , a radius sufﬁcient to allow ion permeation through a hydrophobic pore [16]. Hydrophobic gates may be widespread in a number of ion channels, including K channels [41] and bacterial mechanosensitive channels [14], in addition to other members of the Cys-loop superfamily [1]. A hydrophobic girdle also appears to be present in the protein-conducting channel formed by SecY [87] and so may be a general feature of transmembrane pore proteins that are tightly gated.
Numerous studies have shown that mutations of the conserved leucine (9 , 13 ) and valine residues (13 , 17 ) to more polar residues such as serine or threonine affect gating [1, 25, 32, 33, 36]. The effect of these mutations tends to be an increase in the opening probability or in the mean open time, i.e. they affect the gating transition. Hence the effect of those mutations is more complicated than a simple increase of conductance of the closed state (an increase in the leakage current). A possible hypothesis is that the open state is stabilized by the presence of a solvent; protein structure is not independent of its environment, a fact well known in protein folding. In this picture, a gate made more polar by a mutation will more readily admit water and ions, biasing the receptor toward the open state and so easing the transition to the open state.
From a broader methodological perspective, our results demonstrate the utility of computational approaches to the interpretation of membrane protein structures. But they also point to the difﬁculties in obtaining quantitative output from those simulations. In the present work the total simulated time was about 1µs (more than one order of magnitude larger than what is currently routinely reported) but as the analysis with respect to different MD force ﬁelds showed, there is still some work to be done in order to use MD simulations as a quantitative bridge between structure and function (as seen in experiments).

Free energy. A thermodynamic quantity of a system, which is minimal when the system is in equilibrium. It is crucial for a quantitative understanding of any physical system.

Gating, selectivity, conductance. The three characteristics of ion channels [13]. Gating refers to controlling the ﬂow of ions through the channel; selectivity measures by how much one ion is more likely to permeate than an other; conductance describes the ease of ﬂow of ions through the channel.

Ligand gated ion channels, LGIC. A class of ion channels that are activated by small molecular ligands such as acetylcholine or serotonin. They are primarily involved in functions of the nervous system. The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA), nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh), glycine and the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT3) receptors form a superfamily with a common pentameric architecture [1].

Potential of mean force, PMF. A concept introduced by Kirkwood [89]: the free energy of a system as a function of a (externally constrained) reaction coordinate [63]. If the reaction coordinate is one dimensional (such as z along a channel pore) the PMF is called the ‘free energy proﬁle’. Derived from the constrained (conﬁgurational) partition function Z(ξ ) ∝ d3N x exp[−U (x)/kT ]δ[ξ − ξ(x)], the PMF along ξ is W(ξ ) = −kT ln Z(ξ ) [90].
