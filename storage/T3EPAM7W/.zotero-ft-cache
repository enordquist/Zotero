Many different proteins aggregate into amyloid ﬁbrils characterized by cross-b structure. b-strands contributed by distinct protein molecules are generally found in a parallel in-register alignment. Here, we describe the web server for a novel algorithm, prediction of amyloid structure aggregation (PASTA), to predict the most aggregation-prone portions and the corresponding b-strand inter-molecular pairing for a given input sequence. PASTA was previously shown to yield results in excellent agreement with available experimental observations, when tested on both natively unfolded and structured proteins.

properties and aggregation propensities, allowing the development of different methods which successfully predict aggregation-prone regions [for a recent review see (Caﬂisch, 2006)]. All approaches focus on predicting the b-aggregation propensity of a sequence stretch by itself. A new algorithm, prediction of amyloid structure aggregation (PASTA), was recently introduced by editing a pair-wise energy function for residues facing one another within a b-sheet (Trovato et al., 2006). Two different propensity sets were extracted depending on the orientation (parallel or anti-parallel) of the neighboring strands, from a dataset of known native structures of globular proteins. PASTA associates energies to speciﬁc b-pairings of two sequence stretches of the same length, and further assumes that distinct protein molecules involved in ﬁbril formation will adopt the minimum energy b-pairings in order to better stabilize the cross-b core. A novel feature of PASTA is the ability to predict the registry of the inter-molecular hydrogen bonds formed between amyloidogenic sequence stretches. In this way, the observed tendency of several proteins towards PIRA was rationalized on general grounds. PASTA, however, has also the intrinsic possibility to predict not in register alignment exactly since it considers all the possible matches of the replicas of the same sequence. The good performance of PASTA was tested on both natively unfolded (Trovato et al., 2006) and structured proteins (Trovato et al., 2007).

Introduction

Server description

Several neurodegenerative disorders in humans are associated with the conversion of peptides and proteins from their soluble functional forms into well-deﬁned ﬁbrillar aggregates, generally described as amyloid ﬁbrils (Chiti and Dobson, 2006). Many other proteins, not related to protein deposition diseases, have been found to form amyloid-like ﬁbrils in vitro (Chiti et al., 2003), suggesting that the ability to form the amyloid structure is encoded in the backbone interactions of a generic polypeptide chain. Notably, amyloids are produced by some organisms for functional properties without deleterious effects (Fowler et al., 2006). The emergence of a limited menu of native-like conformations for a single chain and of b-aggregate structures for multiple chains was rationalized theoretically within a sequence independent coarse-grained framework (Hoang et al., 2006).
In spite of the great variability in both sequences and soluble-state structures of precursor proteins, the resulting ﬁbrils exhibit common properties (Sunde and Blake, 1997). Experimental studies identiﬁed the regions of the sequence forming and stabilizing the cross-b core of the ﬁbrils, and clariﬁed the nature of the intermolecular contacts. Parallel in register arrangements (PIRA) of b-strands in the ﬁbril core occurs quite frequently (Ferguson et al., 2006), but antiparallel arrangements are also possible (Makin et al., 2005). Mutational studies of the amyloid aggregation kinetics revealed simple correlations between physico-chemical

The PASTA server takes an amino acid sequence as input and predicts which portions of the sequence are more likely to stabilize the cross-b core of ﬁbrillar aggregates. The input form is very simple, and requires an email address and (optional) title for the prediction job. The output can be divided in three parts: top pairing energies, aggregation proﬁle and pairing matrix.
The top pairing energies are shown in the central part of the output page. Each line contains a predicted high scoring pairing, complete with localization (i.e. residue numbers) and orientation ( parallel or anti-parallel). The number of pairings to be output is set in the input form, with a default of 10 pairings. The PASTA energy is indicative of the aggregation propensity. Benchmarking performed on the dataset of 179 peptides derived from the literature (FernandezEscamilla et al., 2004) revealed close to 80% true positive predictions with a 20% false positive rate at a PASTA energy threshold of – 4.0 (Fig. 1).
The aggregation proﬁle and pairing matrix are provided through links to PDF ﬁles. The aggregation proﬁle shows the normalized per-residue probability h(k) calculated from Eq. (5) in Trovato et al., (2006). It serves to give a visual representation of which regions of the sequence are more likely to aggregate. The pairing matrix is based on the normalized two-dimensional probability h2(k,m) [see Eq. (6) in Trovato et al., (2006)] based on the self-alignment of the sequence.

Fig. 1. Benchmarking of PASTA on a set of 179 experimentally veriﬁed peptides from the literature in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). Both TPR and (1—FPR) are plotted as a function of the PASTA energy threshold. The dotted line corresponding to a threshold of 24.0 achieves the best compromise with 78% for both TPR and (1—FPR).

This can be seen as a b-pairing contact map highlighting, in increasing shades of grey, possible b-ﬁbrillar topologies.
As an example, we show in Fig. 2 the PASTA output for the human amyloid b-peptide (Ab1 – 40), a peptide known to be involved in the Alzheimer’s disease and other pathological conditions such as hereditary cerebral hemmorhage with amyloidosis and inclusion-body myositis (Chiti and Dobson, 2006). The two top-scoring pairings (residues 12– 20 and 31– 40, Fig. 2A) and the predicted PIRA alignment (Fig. 2C) are in very good agreement with experimental evidence

(residues 12 – 24 and 30– 40, varying somewhat between reports) (Petkova et al., 2002).
Source code For those wishing to run PASTA on large sequence ensembles (e.g. entire genomes) or interested in extending the approach, we are providing the source code as a downloadable TAR archive, reachable from the server homepage. The source code consists of an ANSI C program to compute the
