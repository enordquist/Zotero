Abstract of the Thesis
Hydrophobic Gating of Single and Multiple Nanopores
By Laura Michele Innes Master of Science in Physics University of California, 2014 Professor Zuzanna S. Siwy, Chair
The ion transport properties of hydrophobic conical nanopores in polymer films in the presence of a salt solution were studied. The purpose of this study was to develop a hydrophobic gating mechanism similar to those seen in biological channels. Current-voltage curves were measured to determine if the gating behavior was present in hydrophobic modified nanopores, which would be seen as a zero ion current for small voltages and a finite ion current for larger voltages. It is shown, that for a single nanopore to gate water, it must be partially modified such that there are hydrophobic and hydrophilic islands on the pore walls. Similar experiments were also done with 105 pores/cm2 mutlipore samples.

Chapter 1 Introduction
Nanopores are small channels in a medium with openings of a few nanometers[1]. They are of great interest to the scientific community today due to their ability to mimic characteristics of biological channels[2], [3]. This is interesting because nature is well equipped to build structures and mechanisms on the nanoscale, something scientists have yet to perfect. Thus studying nanopores allows for the exploration of nature’s way of achieving this. For example, while we can gate water on the macroscale mechanically, it is still a difficult task to do so on the nanoscale, a task nature has achieved with biological channels. Furthermore, these channels have an ability to regulate the transport of ions due to size, charge, and type. This ability has been used in nanopores for creating nanofluidic circuits with components such as diodes[4].
There are several interactions that are important for the regulation of transport in both biological channels and synthetic nanopores. The three of which will be discussed here are steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions[5]. Steric interactions are the exclusion of ions or molecules due to their size. Thus, the nanopore or biological channel acts like a molecular sieve, excluding larger molecules or ions and allowing only ones that are small enough to pass through. Another important interaction for transport is electrostatic interactions. These interactions allow for the exclusion of ions or molecules based on their charge. For example, if the pore walls are negatively charged, the pore will exclude negative charges, while allowing the transport of positive charges. The last interaction that will be discussed is hydrophobic interactions and it will
1

be discussed in detail throughout as it is the main focus of this paper. Hydrophobic interactions play an important role in the hindrance of the transport of water and thus ions through these channels [6], [7].
1.1 Hydrophobicity in Biological Channels
Hydrophobic interactions are used to regulate ionic and molecular transport in some biological channels. The presence of hydrophobicity has been known in mechanosentive channels for quite some time, while it is a recent discovery in voltage-gated potassium channels. Mechanosensitive channels convert external mechanical stresses into chemical and electrical signals in the cell. These channels can be anion, cation or non-selective. There are two classes of mechanosensitive channels: tethered and tension gated [6]. Tethered channels have a either a cytoskeletal or extracellular element that is attached directly to the channel. With the application of an external stimulus the tether is displaced causing it to pull the channel open. The hair cells in the ear, which are responsible for hearing, use this type of gating mechanism. Tension gated channels are opened when tension in the lipid bilayer actuates conformational changes in the channel.
Hydrophobicity is present in these channels to assist in the regulation of water and ion transport as well as in the regulation of osmotic pressure in the cells. A specific example of how hydrophobicity is used in these channels is the MscL tension channel in E. coli, Figure 1.1[6]. In the figure below the yellow rods represent hydrophobic helices. In the closed state, these helices twist together like an iris. When they are near each other their hydrophobic nature prevents the transport of water and ions through the channel. With the application of tension in the
2

membrane, these hydrophobic helices are pulled apart and water fills the channel. This allows for ions to be transported through the pore.
Figure 1.1: Model of the MscL channel in E. coli. The yellow rods, labeled M1, are hydrophobic helix. When they are closed they form a tight gate, preventing water from being transported through the channel [6].
Unlike mechanosensitive channels, voltage-gated potassium channels are open and closed with a trans-membrane voltage and only transports potassium ions. The channel consists of a voltage sensing domain, S4 helix, the pore and the cavity, see Figure 1.2[7]. The open state of this channel occurs with an applied voltage pulling the S4 helix up, which in turn pulls the pore open, allowing the pore to fill with water and for ions to pass through. Removal of the voltage causes the S4 helix to move inward allowing the pore to close causing ion depletion in the cavity. Since the cavity walls are covered in hydrophobic groups the inward movement of the pore walls forces the water to leave the cavity.

1.2 Synthetic Hydrophobic Nanopores
Biological channels do a wonderful job of gating water and ions with help from hydrophobic interactions. It has been shown that gating of water and ions can be achieved in synthetic nanopores by taking advantage of how water behaves near hydrophobic surfaces[8]. This is because near hydrophobic surfaces water is less dense than the bulk[9]. By bringing two hydrophobic surfaces close together a region where the density of water is less than the bulk density is achieved. Since the synthetic pores are very small, this low density region is achieved and is thus a model system for studying hydrophobic interactions at the nanoscale. Furthermore, this system allows for the gating of water and all species dissolved in it, i.e. ions, charged molecules, and uncharged molecules. Hydrophobic multipores would be ideal for an on demand drug delivery system, as there would be no leakage current caused by diffusion. This means that in order for the drug to be released, an external stimulus would need to be applied. Upon removal of this stimulus the drug would no longer be allowed to pass through the pores. The reversible wetting process was predicted before in a few theoretical publications using continuum, thermodynamic approach as well as molecular dynamics simulations[10],[11].
4

While a hydrophobic multipore system is the final goal, single hydrophobic pores were examined first. Mulitpore systems could possibly be heterogeneous, meaning that the pore sizes and shapes could be inconsistent with one another. Furthermore the gating effect would be averaged over 100,000 pores. Therefore single hydrophobic pores are ideal model systems to study physical basis of hydrophobicity at the nanoscale. This would also allow for better characterization of which pore geometry and opening diameter, as well as which modification conditions create the most reproducible water gating conditions.
1.3 Previous Work With Hydrophobic Nanopores
Hydrophobic gating has been previously seen in single nanopores with a methyl ester modification of the pore walls [8]. In the experiments, electric field rather than pressure
Figure 1.3: Single 16 nm in diameter nanopore in PET modified with trimethylsilyldiazomethane for 15 min. A forward and reverse scan in the voltage range of 5V to -5V[8].
difference was applied to modulate water and ionic transport, as suggested before in theoretical publications [10], [12]. These nanopores remained closed for water and ionic transport until a high enough voltage was applied when a finite ion current was recorded. After voltage was dropped below the threshold value the pore closed again and no detectable signal of ion current was recorded (Figure 1.3). The state without current corresponds to a pore or its fraction filled
5

with water vapor; when current is flowing, a continuous column of water is created along the pore.
The hydrophobic gating behavior was seen in six of the seventeen pores modified in this manner. The other eleven pores were either closed to ionic transport or were open to water and ion transport after being flushed with ethanol. Often the voltage at which the pores opened was not the same voltage at which they closed. Furthermore the opening and closing voltages were not reproducible for subsequent scans. For example, an 11 nm in diameter pore modified in the same conditions as the pore shown in Fig. 1.3 could be opened for ionic transport only at ~8V. Thus there is a need to optimize the pore geometry and surface characteristics so that the wetting-dewetting occurs over many voltage cycles and the voltage at which the wetting transition occurs is well reproduced between the cycles.

Chapter 2 Ion Transport Properties of Nanopores
Nanopores exhibit transport properties not seen in their macroscopic counterparts. These behaviors for example include the selectivity of ions by their charge and the rectification of the ion current. Studying the transport properties of nanopores is important as it can provide information about interactions of ions with surfaces and the interactions of ions with each other. This is information which could not been discovered using macroscopic pores due to their large size. The ion transport properties of nanopores can be manipulated through modification of the walls of the nanopore and the shape of the nanopore. Negative surface charges of nanopores make them cation selective and modulate ionic concentrations in the pore and at the pore entrances. Using a conical geometry instead of a cylindrical geometry, allows for the rectification of the ion current. Patterning the nanopore walls with different chemical groups allows for changes in ion current behavior that lead to the creation of an ionic diode and a hydrophobic gate. In order to understand the how these behaviors come about, first the ionic transport properties of a cylindrical nanopore with negative pore walls will be discussed. The discussion will then move to the negatively charged conical nanopore and the effect of different modifications on the transport properties of water and ions.
2.1 Basic Theory of Ion Transport Through Charged Pores
Ions can be transported through the nanopore using electric, pressure, concentration, and thermal gradients. Thermal and pressure gradients do not need to be considered, as the system is open to the outside and remains at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Thus the passage
7

of ions through the nanopore is due to two gradients, concentration and electric. Movement of the ions through the nanopore due to a concentration gradient is known as diffusion and obeys Fick’s law of diffusion. The movement of ions through the nanopore due to the potential gradient obeys Ohm’s law. Combining these two laws leads to the equation below, which is also known as the Nernst-Planck equation[13].

2.2 Electrical Double Layer Formation
The Poisson-Boltzmann equation also allows for predicting distribution of ions without any voltage applied. Figure 2.2 shows a charged surface in contact with an electrolyte solution[14]. Close the charged surface of the pore walls, the concentration of counterions is enhanced.

This distribution of charges stems from electroneutrality and results in an electric potential that satisfies Poisson’s equation (equation 2.4), where C(x) represents the distribution of charges at the surface. For this the Boltzmann distribution is used.

2.3 Example of Transport Properties of Nanopores: Studies of Conically Shaped Pores
The Siwy group has extensively studied transport properties of conically shaped nanopores. They are prepared in 12 micrometers thick films of polyethylene terephthalate by the tracketching technique. The small opening of the pore can be as small as 2 nm. Due to the fabrication process the pores walls contain carboxyl groups which at pH values above 3.8 render the walls negatively charged. These conically shaped nanopores are cation selective and rectify the current so that the preferential direction of the cation flow is from the narrow opening to the

12

wide opening of the pore. In our electrode configuration, negative currents are larger than positive currents.

A rectification of the ion current was explained by modeling the system using PoissonNernst-Planck equations. The modeling predicted voltage-dependent ionic concentrations in the pore. For negative voltages, concentrations of both potassium and chloride ions are enhanced at the narrow opening of the pore; the concentrations are significantly higher than the bulk concentration. For positive voltages, there is a zone formed with depleted concentrations of ions, which limits the ion current. The negative charges on the walls of the pore cause the

concentration of the positive ions to be higher than the bulk concentration in order to preserve electroneutrality. This is seen in Figure 2.4[15].

Chapter 3 Ionic Transport through Hydrophobic Nanopores:
Theory of Hydrophobic Gating
There are three required states for hydrophobic gating. First is that the nanopore is dewetted, meaning that there are no ions or bulk water in a region inside the pore only a water vapor. This is achieved through chemical modification of the pore walls with hydrophobic groups. Second is the wetting of the channel after the application of a critical bias. This wetting is caused by an increase in pressure inside the nanopore, forcing the condensation of the water vapor and allowing for the flow of water and ions. Finally, after removal of the critical bias, the channel needs to be able to dewet again. This is an indication that the water has to evaporate in a region inside the pore so that no flow of ions or water occurs. It is important that the wetting/dewetting transition is reversible over many cycles, creating the basis of hydrophobic gating. The aspects required to wet and dewet the pore are discussed in more detail in the following sections.
3.1 Initial Dewetting Requirements
There are two major requirements for the nanopore to initially dewet. First, the pore walls have to contain hydrophobic groups. Second, the opening diameter of the nanopore needs to be small enough for the spontaneous evaporation of confined water to be possible. Kinetic and thermodynamic requirements for this to occur were discussed in detail in a series of theoretical publications[16][17].
3.1.1 Contact Angle of the Surface
Contact angle of a liquid drop on a surface is normally understood as a macroscopic phenomenon. It examines the average interaction of a solution, in this case water, with a surface.
16

This interaction is seen over an area that is much larger than the surface inside the nanopore. When a droplet of water on a surface has a contact angle larger than 90 degrees the surface is considered hydrophobic. The contact angle allows for the relation of the surface tension between the wall and the vapor, , and between the wall and liquid, with the tension between the liquid and vapor, .
[3.1]
The relation describes balancing of cohesive and adhesive forces. Experimentally, the contact angle is determined by dropping a small droplet of water onto the surface and measuring the angle between the surface and the curvature of the droplet, as seen in Figure 3.1.
Figure 3.1: Water drop on PET modified with methyl esters for 24 hours resulting in a contact angle of 102°[8].
3.1.2 Spacing of Hydrophobic Surfaces
The other import condition for the initial dewetting of the nanopore is the spacing between hydrophobic surfaces i.e. the opening diameter of the nanopore. This spacing needs to be small enough for the spontaneous evaporation of confined water to occur. It has been shown that water is less dense near hydrophobic surfaces[9]. Thus, bringing two hydrophobic surfaces
17

very close together should result in a region where the density of water is much less than that of bulk water. In order to calculate the separation required, the system will be simplified to two square surfaces. Spontaneous evaporation of water occurs when the grand potential of a confined liquid ( ) and the grand potential of a confined vapor ( ) are equal to each other [16].
[3.2]

[3.3]

In the above equations P is the pressure of the liquid, V=

is the volume of the space in

between the two surfaces,

is the area of the wall liquid or wall vapor interface, and A =

L is the area of the liquid vapor interface, L is the length of the side of the surface, and is

the distance between the two surfaces. Equating the above equations and solving for :

[3.4]
⁄
Assuming the contact angle of 110 degrees the predicted separation for the thermodynamic threshold is 100 nm[16]. However, in experiment this separation is too large and pores with this diameter do not dewet. As a result the kinetic threshold separation distance also needs to be considered. The separation of two hydrophobic surfaces that is required lies somewhere between these two thresholds. This is seen in the Figure 3.2. In between the vapor and liquid curve, water is in a metastable state, which is the condition needed for hydrophobic gating.

18

Figure 3.2: (A) Schematic representation of the kinetic and thermodynamic spacing for a stable vapor and liquid phase, respectively (B) A graphical representation of (A) where to the left of the vapor curve water is in a stable vapor state, to the right of the liquid curve water is in a stable liquid state, while in between these two curves water is in a metastable state between liquid and vapor.[16]
3.2 Wetting the Hydrophobic Nanopore
As mentioned above, the hydrophobic surface and small spacing of the surfaces forces the water to be less dense and thus in a metastable vapor phase. In order for ions and water to be allowed to flow through the nanopore, the vapor needs to be condensed into liquid water, which can be achieved by applying a pressure difference.
The pressure difference required to wet the nanopore is calculated using the Young-Laplace equation
[3.5]
where γ is the surface tension, κ is the total curvature, and since there are two liquid gas interfaces a factor of 2 is inserted. This can be simplified further using
[3.6]
19

with and representing the radii of curvature and are defined as negative for a concave liquid surface. Since the nanopore is considered to be sufficiently narrow so the curvature in the lateral plane, is equal to the radius of the pore opening and is zero. The simplified equation for the pressure gradient becomes

|

|

[3.7]

where θ is the contact angle and

| | is the width of the channel. The pressure

required to wet one of the typical pores used, contact angle of 102°, diameter of 10nm is 59 atm.

In order to wet pores with just pressure a very robust mechanical system would be required.

Therefore electrostatic pressure was used to wet the pores. In order to calculate the electric field

required to wet the pore, the Maxwell stress tensor was added to the Young-Laplace equation

giving:

[3.8]

with ε representing the permittivity of the liquid and E the electric field. Using the same properties of the nanopore above, the required electric field to wet the pore is 92 MV/m. Although the value is still really large, it would not require the same kind of robust mechanical system as the pressure.
3.2.1 Hydrophobic Gating is Facilitated by the Presence of Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Islands
As shown above the electric field required to wet an entirely modified pore is very high. Since our pores are 12 micrometers long the required voltage to achieve this high electric field
20

would be 1200V, a value not easily accessible in the experiments. The required electric field would be however easy to achieve if a few nm wide hydrophobic islands were created on the pore walls.
This hypothesis has been tested with single conically shaped nanopores in polymer films. The carboxyl groups on the pore walls were changed into methyl esters using trimethylsilyldiazomethane. A complete modification of the pore walls performed overnight resulted in the contact angle of 102 degrees, and these pores could not be open even with a voltage of 10V. Modification of only fraction of the groups performed in a diluted solution of the chemical for 15 min. resulted most probably in a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic islands. This modification led to the contact angle of 80°, significantly higher than the contact angle of an unmodified PET surface. This pore exhibited hydrophobic gating opening for ionic transport at ~2V.
Figure 3.3: (A) The first panel shows that an unmodified pore allows for the transport of water and ions. The second panel shows that after modification there is only water vapor present inside the nanopore. The third panel shows that even with the application of voltage the water vapor inside the nanopore cannot be condensed into liquid water. (B) The first panel again shows an unmodified nanopore. The second panel shows a partial modification, where there are areas that are hydrophilic. This allows for the water near these surfaces to remain at the density of the bulk, liquid water. The final panel shows that with the application of voltage there is a flow of ions. This occurs because a smaller area of water vapor needs to be condensed.[8]

We believe the idea of hydrophobic islands is valid, as the largest element of resistance is the vapor region inside the pore, meaning that the entire voltage drop is across that region. This is important since the electric field inside the pore is calculated as the applied voltage divided by the distance over which the voltage drop occurs. If the entire pore is modified then the electric field inside the pore is 1V/12000nm which is only 83 kV/m. This is orders of magnitude lower than the electric field required to wet the pore. However, if only small parts of the nanopore are modified the vapor regions become smaller and the voltage drops over a smaller distance. For 1V over a 10 nm vapor region the electric field would be 100MV/m. This value is much closer to the required electric field needed.
3.2.2 Cassie’s Law: Opening Hydrophobic Nanopores
The pores that exhibited hydrophobic gating had contact angles of ~80°, which is not considered a hydrophobic surface. However it is important to remember that the contact angle
22

measurement is a macroscopic measurement and the areas of hydrophobicity that we are concerned with are nanoscopic. Therefore the contact angle measurement would be an average over hydrophobic and hydrophilic islands on a surface. Cassie’s law is used for determining the contact angle of composite surfaces and has the form
[3.9] where is the contact angle of the composite surface, is the fraction of the surface that has a contact angle of and is the same for the surface with a contact angle of . If the surface was 50% modified, contact angle of 102°, and 50% unmodified, contact angle of 58°, the new contact angle would be 80°. This further suggests that islands of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups are required for hydrophobic gating behavior to be present.
3.3 Dewetting a Pore Filled with Water
In order to dewet a nanopore filled with water, it needs to be small and have hydrophobic surfaces. However, these conditions do not guarantee that a nanopore will dewet after the initial wetting of the pore. There are still discussions in the literature on the necessity for a vapor bubble to exist in order to achieve hydrophobic gating. Smirnov et al presented experimental data with silicon nitride nanopore showing that each hydrophobic pore eventually was irreversibly wetted once all vapor bubbles were removed [18]. On the other hand, polymer hydrophobic pores were opening and closing even in a degassed solution (Fig. 1.3).
23

The nanpores exhibiting reversible hydrophobic gating are believed to have hydrophobic islands on their walls. Near the hydrophobic islands the water density is lower than bulk, somewhere near the vapor density, and remains at this density even when the pore is filled with liquid water. This could possibly replace the need for the presence of vapor bubbles in the solution. For this to work the hydrophobic groups would need to be adjacent to one another, a

schematic of the hydrophobic group placement is seen in Figure 3.5. The pore initially is filled with only water vapor. With the application of a critical pressure the water vapor is forced to condense, wetting the pore and allowing for ion current to flow. However, there are still regions near the hydrophobic surfaces where the density of water is the vapor density. Once the pressure is low enough the vapor regions can span the width of the pore joining together and preventing the flow of water or ions. Pockets of water remain trapped between water vapor regions in the
24

pore. In spite of the remaining water pockets, no ions or water can flow as the pockets are not connected to the bulk solutions.

Chapter 4 Fabrication of Conical Hydrophobic Nanopores
Single and multiple conical nanopores created in Polyethylene terephthalate, PET, were used for this experiment. Creation of conical hydrophobic nanopores in PET is done with the tracketch technique. This process starts at the GSI accelerator in Darmstadt, Germany by irradiating the films with single heavy ions to create a local damage track followed by chemical etching of the film. The foils used are 12 microns thick and have a diameter of 3 cm.
4.1 Latent Damage Track Formation, Development and Characterization
The formation of the latent damage track begins with the linear accelerator UNILAC at the Gesellschaft fuer Schwerionenforschung, Darmsadt, Germany. There the PET foils are irradiated with heavy ions of gold or uranium at 2 GeV of total kinetic energy. The irradiation density can be controlled between 1 and 1010 ions per cm2. Once the correct number of ions has passed through the foil, the irradiation is stopped. Deposition of the energy from each swift, heavy ion creates a damaged track in the foil [19], which is later etched to create the pore. Thus the number of ions used in the irradiation is equal to the number of pores obtained after the etching.
After the foils are irradiated, they are exposed to long wave UV light for one hour on each side. The UV irradiation damages the track further, which facilitates the etching and makes it more reproducible between various foils. The UV irradiation also increases the etching time by a factor of ~3[20]. The shape of the etched pore can be controlled by adjusting the two etch rates, the bulk etch rate, , and the track etch rate, . The bulk etch rate is the rate at which the pore size grows and the track etch rate is the rate of etching along the damaged track. Etching the foil
26

from both sides at an elevated temperature creates a cylindrically shaped pore, as the track etch rate and the bulk etch are the same. By etching the foils with 9M NaOH from one side, a conical geometry is formed. This occurs because the track etch rate is slower when etching from one side at room temperature, thus creating a small opening and a larger opening angle[21], [22]. One way to confirm the pore geometry is to prepare metal replica of the pores. [23], Figure (4.1). The replica in Fig. 4.1. was created by electroless plating of gold inside of a multipore membrane with conically shaped pores, followed by etching away the foil. The exposed wire is a negative replica of one of the pores.
Figure 4.1: SEM image of a replica of a single nanpore. This was created by electroless deposition of gold inside of a conical nanopore. [23]
The etching protocol to obtain conically shaped nanopores was developed based on foils irradiated with single ions. The etching was performed in a conductivity cell in which one side of the film was placed in contact with 9M NaOH. The other side was in contact with a mixture of formic acid and KCl as a neutralizing medium. One volt is applied across the membrane, with the working electrode on the side of the etchant and the ground electrode on the side with the stopping solution, in order to monitor the etching process. In the beginning of the etching process no current is recorded across the membrane. Once the pore is etched through finite ionic current
27

is measured. We stop the etching when ~200 pA is recorded. The etching process is stopped by turning off the applied voltage, removing the etchant, rinsing with water, and replacing it with the stopping solution. The development of the damage tracks for the mulipore foils is similar, except the foil is etched from both sides with 9M NaOH for 10 minutes in the beginning. This is to make sure that all the pores open. Then the etchant on the grounded electrode side is rinsed and replaced with the stopping solutions. The track is etched until a sufficiently high current is obtained, typically 5 uA.
Figure 4.2: Etching of a conical nanopore in a conductivity cell.
Determining the size of the small diameter, d, of the nanopore is done electrochemically, with the equation shown below:
[4.1] In this equation L is the length of the pore which is 12 microns and κ is the conductivity of 1M KCl which is 10 S/m. R is the resistance through the pore which is determined by linear regression of the I-V curve taken in 1M KCl from -100mV to 100mV. D is the large diameter of the nanopore and is determined by the following equation:
28

[4.2] Where t is the etch time and 2.13 nm/min is the room temperature etch rate of 9M NaOH. For the nanopore represented by the I-V curve in Figure 4.3, the etch rate was 223 min with a large diameter of 950 nm and a small diameter of 6 nm.

For conically shaped nanopores, like the ones used for the majority of presented here
experiments, it is also important to check that the pores rectify to verify that the pore is conical in
shape. An example of rectifying I-V curve is shown in Figure 2.3.

4.2 Hydrophobic Modification of Nanopores
Two different modifications were performed to render the pore walls hydrophobic. The first approach was based on direct esterification of carboxyl groups on the pore walls with trimethylsilyldiazomethane (Figure 4.4 A). Single and mutlipore membranes were modified using this method. The second modification involved linking decylamines with carboxyl groups using EDC as a linker, Figure 4.4 B, and was applied to single nanopores. The second approach was developed because the amine groups are more hydrophobic. It is also known that the EDC based conversion is not complete thus the pore walls are expected to contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. In order to determine whether the modifications can lead to hydrophobic surfaces, PET films without pores were modified according to the same procedures, and the contact angle was measured, Figure 4.5 A and B.

4.2.1 Methyl Ester Modification
The methyl ester modification was done in collaboration with the Shea lab and performed by Leah Cleary. For this modification single PET foils were placed in a flame dried Erlenmeyer flask that had been purged with nitrogen. The flask was then stoppered with a rubber septum. Freshly distilled methanol was added to the flask. Trimethylsilyldiazomethane was then added to the desired concentration. After the required reaction time, the excess trimethylsilyldiazomethane was quenched with the addition of one mL of water. The foils were rinsed with methanol and then water.
4.2.2 Decylamine Modification
While the methyl ester modification was done in a flask, the decylamine modification was done in the conductivity cell. First a mixture of pentafluorophenol, PFP, and Ethyl-3(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, EDC, was dissolved in ethanol. This mixture was placed in the reservoirs on either side of the foil for one hour. EDC is an active intermediate that is used to
31

cross link PFP with the carboxyl groups on the pore walls and PFP is an amine reactive intermediate. Once the reaction is complete, each reservoir is rinsed with ethanol. A solution consisting of 68.4 uL of decylamine and 5mL of ethanol is placed in either reservoir. After the desired reaction time, the solution is removed and the pore is first rinsed with ethanol and then with water.

Chapter 5 Experimental Results

Transport properties of modified nanopores were examined in the same conductivity cell in which they were etched. The working electrode was placed on the side of the pore with the small opening and the grounded electrode on the side of the pore with the large opening. The experimental setup is illustrated in Figure 5.1. The first recordings were typically performed with the amplifier 200B set-up stepping the voltage by 100 mV. The voltage would be cycled forward and backward recording 30 s long time series at each voltage. The voltage range used was -1, +1 and -5V, +5V. Additional current-voltage curves were performed using Keithly 6487 picoammeter/voltage source to determine if the transport behavior was reproducible.

In total twenty two single nanopores were modified with decylamines. Of the twenty two; three were completely closed for ionic transport, six were closed, but then opened without
33

exhibiting any hydrophobic gating behaviors, eight were open for ionic transport, and five nanopores exhibited hydrophobic gating that would reproducibly switch between conducting and non-conducting states. An example recording is shown in Figure 5.2. The non-conducting state of the current is attributed to the pore or its fraction being filled with water vapor. Recording finite current indicates water condensation. According to our nomenclature, the zero/finite current transition has to be reproducible at least three times to classify a given modified pore as performing hydrophobic gating. Of all five pores that exhibited hydrophobic gating, four eventually opened to ion current conductance for all non-zero voltages. One example of a pore

current transition, Figure 5.2, and this gating behavior was seen up to the 21st scan, Figure 5.3. However, with scan 22 the gating effect began to disappear and by scan 23 it was completely gone, Figure 5.4. To gain a better understanding of the dynamic character and disappearance of the gating behavior of this device, the opening and closing voltages of each scan were compared, Figure 5.5. The best fit lines slope downward, which indicate an opening of the pore.

pore was initially scanned on the Axopatch, runs of thirty scans were performed using the Keithley picoammeter using voltage scans from -5V to +5V with the hydrophobic gating behavior remaining through all the scans. This is seen particularly well in the average of all thirty scans, Figure 5.6. The reproducibility of the hydrophobic gating behavior is exemplified in Figure 5.7 which compares the opening and closing voltages of each scan. Here the best fit lines are fairly horizontal, meaning that the scans are similar to one another and there is no opening of the pore at lower voltages. This pore continued switching between open and closed states through the last scans.

5.1 Hysteresis
One of the peculiar aspects of the behavior of hydrophobic pores was the hysteresis of their IV curves, Figure 5.8, which occurred in all the pores to varying degrees. The presence of a hysteresis indicates that the voltage required to condense the water vapor inside the pore into liquid water was higher than the voltage at which the liquid water inside the pore evaporated back into water vapor. In the case of the hysteresis in Figure 5.8 it took an application of 7V to open the pore to ion and water transport, but the pore remained open until the applied voltage

38

was 1.1V. It is believed that the hysteric behavior seen in the I-V curves is due to the fact that condensation and evaporation of the water inside the pore are path dependent processes.

5.2 Ion Current Fluctuations
The signal of ion current in time at intermediate voltages between the closed and open states, often exhibited fluctuations. Two types of fluctuations were observed. First was the increased rms noise superimposed on the baseline current, Figure 5.9. Second, was the fluctuations between a closed state with zero current and an open state with a finite current, Figure 5.10. The

39

CuCrrurernet,nt( (ppAA))

second type of fluctuations was predicted by the molecular dynamics simulations and was explained by dynamical changes of the number of water molecules in the pore.
Figure 5.9: Comparison of unmodified (top) and modified (bottom) ion current time series.
The first type of fluctuations most probably stems from the presence of vapor pockets at the pore walls. As the water is less dense next to hydrophobic surfaces and the vapor state in this small area is metastable, the size of the vapor region is expected to fluctuate over time. Our hypothesis states, it is the fluctuation of the size of the vapor pocket that causes the changes in the baseline current. If the vapor pocket gets bigger the effective diameter of the pore gets smaller and thus fewer ions pass through the pore and a lower ion current is recorded. However if the vapor pocket becomes smaller the effective diameter of the nanopore becomes larger allowing for more ions to flow through the pore causing the recorded ion current to be higher.
40

Current (pA)

Figure 5.10: Fluctuations between a conducting and non-conducting state.
The fluctuations between conducting and non-conducting states are also due to the metastable state of the water next to the hydrophobic islands. In this particular case the vapor pockets fluctuate from being large enough to prohibit the flow of ion current to a smaller size, allowing a small amount of ion current to flow.
5.3 Multi Pores
Twelve membranes containing 105 pores/cm2 were modified with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, as described in Chapter 4. Of those twelve one was closed for ionic transport, two exhibited hydrophobic gating, and nine were open to ionic transport. Most of the multipore samples were open, which we think was due to heterogeneity of the pore size. The size of each individual pore of a multipore sample is difficult to determine, therefore the average size of each pore is found instead. Similar to single nanopores, an I-V curve in 1M KCl from -100mV to 100mV is taken to determine the resistance of the pores. Equation 4.1 is used to determine the small opening diameter, which for the mutlipore sample gives the effective size of all 100,000 pores together. Thus to estimate the size of a single pore in the sample, the effective size needs to
41

be divided by the total number of pores. Since all the measurements taken are an average of all the pores the average pore diameter is only a few nm, thus there might be pores with an opening diameter over 10 nm. The presence of these large pores would prevent the sample from exhibiting the hydrophobic gating i.e. switching between open and closed states. An example of a multiple membrane which did switch between non-conducting and conducting states is shown in Figure 5.11. The magnitude of the measured current in the open states indicate that only a few nanopores would undergo the transitions, while the remaining pores were closed for ionic transport.

Chapter 6 Conclusions
In this thesis I have discussed the fabrication of nanopores, important interactions that regulate the ion current behavior in nanopores, hydrophobic gating requirements, and data showing gating is possible and reproducible on the single nanopore level. A manipulation of the discussed interactions allow for the creation of various mimics of biological channels and the creation of various nanoscale gating mechanisms. The diode modified pore which controlled the transport of ions based on their charge. The main focus, however, was the creation of a hydrophobic nanopore, which would control the transport of water, as well as anything dissolved in the water.
There are three main stages for the aforementioned hydrophobic gate. First is the initial dewetting of the nanopore. This is done through modification of the hydrophilic surface into a hydrophobic surface and the small separation between these surfaces that induces the spontaneous evaporation of the confined water. Evaporation of the liquid water into a water vapor prohibits the flow of water and ions through the pore. Second is the opening of the gate by applying electrostatic pressure, causing the water vapor inside the pore to condense. This condensation allows for the flow of water and ions again. Finally with the removal of this pressure the water inside the pore must return to a vapor state. Therefore, the flow of water and ions cease, thus the gate returns to its closed state.
It was shown that several nanopores modified with decylamines exhibited hydrophobic gating. A few pores were able to reversible gate water for several runs, one in particular was
43

reversible for over thirty runs. Thus the creation of a single hydrophobically gated nanopore was achieved. Also discussed was the attempt to gate mutlipores by modifying them with methyl ester groups. However, this was not as successful as the gating of the single pores. Hydrophobic gating was seen in one foil, albeit not repeatedly.
