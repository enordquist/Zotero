We did not intend to infer that it is acceptable to project arbitrary structural models into electron density noise. What we emphasized, however, is that it is possible to see meaningful structural information from relatively weak electron density. We provided several examples in support of our argument from published work in our previous response.

Presence of negative density in some region does not necessarily mean that positive density in the ligand binding region is also noise, especially when this positive density is also supported by the presence of densities in simulated annealing 2Fo–Fc composite omit maps. After deletion of Y240 from Protein Data Bank (PDB): 4H0H, the suggestion that electron density for Y240 is not interpretable at contour level 2.5 σ is not correct, as one can clearly make out boundaries of the hydrophobic ring and other features of Y240 in figure 2 of the response by Pozharski et al. to our comments.

The main argument of Pozharski et al. has been concerning the presence of experimental electron density for building the model in the map. In this context, it has to be noted that the Ramachandran parameters are not directly linked to the presence or absence of the electron density. Guidelines to define fit of model to the electron density used by the Uppsala Electron Density Server, on the basis of which the graphs providing real space R -value Z scores are calculated, are meant only for the relative quality of a PDB entry, but not for its absolute authenticity as indicated by the report of the Task Force of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank ( 1 ). It is important to note that a significant number of PDB entries associated with published structures have model fits similar to those in our structures. Incidentally, such data were included in the PDB subsequent to the acceptance of our papers for publication. We disagree with the contention of Pozharski et al. about the interpretations of our electron density maps.
