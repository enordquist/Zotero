A dry ligand-binding cavity in a solvated protein Johan Qvist*, Monika Davidovic*, Donald Hamelberg † , and Bertil Halle* ‡ *Center for Molecular Protein Science, Department of Biophysical Chemistry, Lund University, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; and † Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0365 Edited by Brian W. Matthews, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, and approved January 31, 2008 (received for review October 16, 2007) Ligands usually bind to proteins by displacing water from the binding site. The affinity and kinetics of binding therefore depend on the hydration characteristics of the site. Here, we show that the extreme case of a completely dehydrated free binding site is realized for the large nonpolar binding cavity in bovine  -lacto- globulin. Because spatially delocalized water molecules may es- cape detection by x-ray diffraction, we use water 17 O and 2 H magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD), 13 C NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy calculations to establish the absence of water from the binding cavity. Whereas carbon nanotubes of the same diameter are filled by a hydrogen- bonded water chain, the MRD data show that the binding pore in the apo protein is either empty or contains water molecules with subnanosecond residence times. However, the latter possibility is ruled out by the computed hydration free energies, so we conclude that the 315 Å 3 binding pore is completely empty. The apo protein is thus poised for efficient binding of fatty acids and other non- polar ligands. The qualitatively different hydration of the  -lacto- globulin pore and carbon nanotubes is caused by subtle differences in water–wall interactions and water entropy.  -lactoglobulin  free energy simulation  hydrophobic hydration  magnetic relaxation dispersion G lobular proteins are stabilized by dense atomic packing and by water exclusion from the nonpolar core region. However, the packing density is not uniform and a typical protein contains approximately four cavities per 100 residues of sufficient size to accommodate at least one water molecule (1). Small nonpolar cavities are usually empty and can be regarded as packing defects, whereas small polar cavities tend to be occupied by structural water molecules that stabilize the folded protein by H-bonding to other- wise unsatisfied peptide partners (2). Large cavities are frequently linked to protein functions, such as ligand binding and transport, membrane translocation, and enzyme catalysis. Some of these large cavities are lined exclusively or predominantly by nonpolar side- chains. The question whether such large nonpolar cavities are empty or contain water molecules is of fundamental biological importance (3–8). The principal tool of structural biology, x-ray crystallography, cannot easily resolve this issue. There are three potential prob- lems. ( i ) Because water molecules interact only weakly with the nonpolar cavity walls, they tend to be positionally disordered. As a result of such delocalization, the electron density of the water molecules may fall below the detection limit. ( ii ) At a typical resolution limit of  2 Å, a contaminating nonpolar ligand may be misinterpreted as a water cluster (9, 10). ( iii ) For structures determined at cryogenic temperatures, the hydration status of the cavity may be altered by re-equilibration during the flash cooling process (11). In favorable cases, water molecules in nonpolar protein cav- ities can be inferred from intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) measured by solution NMR spectroscopy (12, 13). However, weak water–protein NOEs, as expected from disordered water molecules, are difficult to distinguish from intramolecular NOEs relayed by exchanging labile protons (14) or even from long-range NOEs to bulk water (15). Molecular dynamics and free-energy simulations can in principle provide detailed insights about cavity hydration, but their predictive power is limited by the known shortcomings of current force fields (16, 17). Several attempts have been made to establish the hydration state of a nonpolar 40 Å 3 cavity in human interleukin-1  . The two x-ray diffraction studies that focused on this issue came to different conclusions: the first study assigned two water mol- ecules with 70% occupancy to the cavity (18), whereas the more recent one indicated that the cavity is empty (19). Free energy calculations on a nonpolar spherical model cavity indicated stable hydration by clusters of at least three cyclically H-bonded water molecules (20), but the interleukin-1  x-ray data are not consistent with a cluster of three or more water molecules unless the occupancy is very low (so the cavity is empty most of the time). In contradiction with the x-ray results, water NOEs with protein protons near the interleukin cavity were taken as evidence for two to four water molecules in the cavity (12) and a recent MD simulation study indicated stable hydration by a four-water cluster (21). The hydration status of the interleukin-1  cavity thus remains controversial. Free-energy calculations on a large, weakly polar, globular cavity in the surface layer protein tetrabrachion predicted stable hydration by a cluster of seven to nine water molecules (22), in line with calculations on model cavities (20) and fully consistent with the crystal structure. Agreement between free energy calculations and x-ray crystallography was also found for a 160 Å 3 nonpolar cavity engineered into T4 lysozyme, which was found to be empty under ambient conditions but cooperatively filled by several water molecules at kbar pressures (23). Here, we investigate the hydration of a functional cavity that is both larger and less polar than any of the cavities mentioned above. Like other members of the lipocalin family, bovine  -lactoglobulin (BLG) has a  -barrel fold enclosing a cavity that binds nonpolar ligands, including palmitate (9, 24, 25). This cavity, known as the calyx, has a volume of 315 Å 3 (as gauged by a 1.4 Å probe) with approximately cylindrical (5  15 Å) shape. The cavity is lined by 12 aliphatic and one aromatic side chain, with only one polar atom (Met-107.S) withi n5Åofthecavity axis. Access to the calyx is restricted by a flexible loop that forms a lid on the calyx entrance. Deprotonation of Glu-89, with an anomalously high p K a value, triggers a conformational transition that opens the lid (9, 26). Depending on ionic strength, this so-called Tanford transition occurs in the pH range 6–8. The available crystallographic evidence does not conclusively establish whether the calyx is hydrated in the apo form of BLG. In several structures with the loop in the open conformation (at pH  7), no electron density was found in the calyx (9, 24). However, in the structure 3BLG, in the closed conformation at pH 6.2, the electron density observed in the calyx was modeled as a string of five water molecules (Fig. 1) within H-bonding Author contributions: J.Q., D.H., and B.H. designed research; J.Q. and M.D. performed research; J.Q. and B.H. analyzed data; and J.Q. and B.H. wrote the paper.

distance (2.7–3.0 Å) of each other (9, 27). The C–C separations across the calyx at the positions of these five water molecules are 8  1 Å, closely matching the corresponding dimension (8.1 Å) of the smallest carbon nanotube (CNT). Experimental and computational studies show that such CNTs are filled by a chain of water molecules under ambient conditions (28). To clarify the hydration status of the calyx, we have performed water 17 O and 2 H magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) mea- surements (29) on BLG in aqueous solution. Because palmitate displaces any water molecules in the calyx, we can directly monitor calyx hydration via the difference in the MRD data recorded on the apo protein and the palmitate–BLG complex. This difference-MRD approach has been used to characterize internal water molecules in polar cavities (30–32). The MRD data indicate that the calyx is devoid of long-lived (  ns) water, and the presence of more mobile water is ruled out by the free energy calculations reported here. We also obtain information about the smaller polar cavities, which are found to be occupied by ordered water molecules with residence times of  20 ns, consistent with our MD simulations. Results Identification of Internal Water Molecules. Water 17 O and 2 HMRD profiles were recorded from aqueous solutions of BLG at neutral pH (Figs. 2 and 3). The apo form of BLG, without any hydrophobic ligand in the calyx, was examined at pH 7.4 (sample A1, calyx lid open) and at pH 6.2 (sample A2, calyx lid closed). Two independent samples (H1 and H2) of the holo form with a palmitate molecule bound in the calyx were studied, both at pH 7.4. At neutral pH, the protein exists predominantly as a homodimer. The dimer interface buries only 6% of the solvent- accessible surface area and does not interfere with ligand binding because the entrance to the calyx is 15 Å from the nearest dimer contact (9, 24). The structural changes in the protein induced by fatty acid binding are small and localized (25). Any observed difference between the concentration-normalized MRD profiles from the holo and apo proteins can therefore be attributed to water molecules in the calyx of the apo form, which are displaced by the bound palmitate molecule in the holo form. This argument assumes that the holo sample really has palmitate Fig. 1. View of the crystal structure 3BLG (9) of  -lactoglobulin, showing two water molecules (red) buried in small polar cavities (labeled 175 and 177 in 3BLG, with 177 closer to the calyx) and five water molecules (blue) modeled in the nonpolar calyx. We label the calyx waters 1–5 starting from the bottom; the corresponding 3BLG labels are 178, 190, 179, 180, and 233. The cavity surface in the calyx is color-coded according to whether the contributing protein atoms are polar (red) or nonpolar (brown). The light green cartoon representation shows one of the two  sheets enclosing the nonpolar calyx. The figure was rendered with PyMOL (www.pymol.org) using a 1.4 Å probe to define the (external and internal) molecular surfaces of the protein and the same protein vdW radii as used for the cavity volume calculations.
