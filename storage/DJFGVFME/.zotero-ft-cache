Abstract. Water-mediated, effective, long-range interaction between two hydrophobic surfaces immersed in water is of great importance in natural phenomena. We perform the molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of temperature on the attractive force between two graphene-like hydrophobic surfaces in SPC/E water. We systematically calculate the force between two hydrophobic surfaces at different inter-wall separations (d) and subsequently determine the correlation lengths at different temperatures. A signiﬁcant change in the strength of the attractive hydrophobic force is observed with the variation of temperature. The correlation length of effective hydrophobic force increases on lowering the temperature. We also examine the temperature effects on the behavior of conﬁned water molecules by computing the density and orientational proﬁles. The analyses of these proﬁles suggest that the layering of water molecules induced by surfaces decreases with increase in temperature of the system. Critical dewetting distance (dc), where drying transition phenomenon occurs, shifts to the lower value of d upon cooling.
Keywords. Hydrophobic force; correlation length of HFL; drying transition; tetrahedral order parameter.

1. Introduction
The interactions between hydrophobic solutes have numerous applications in several colloidal and biomolecular assemblies and in the formation of protein complexes.1–7 One of the important manifestations of the hydrophobic interactions is observed in oil-water de-mixing because of the low solubility of hydrophobes (i.e., oil) in water.1 Several controlled experimental studies directly measured the range and nature of interactions between the two large hydrophobic surfaces inside solutions. It was Israelachvili,8,9 who ﬁrst mentioned that the interaction force between two large hydrophobic surfaces is attractive and long range (i.e.,100–1000 Å) in nature. Recent developments in this area debated the length scales of the hydrophobic attraction. The initial outcome of 100 Å length scale was later considered to be the part of the ‘shortranged’ hydrophobic interaction, while the observed ‘long-ranged’ force that could extend beyond 3000 Å was attributed to such artefacts as aeration.10,11 However, Ducker and co-workers12 reported a different

observation that in the case of concentrated aqueous salt solution hydrophobic force could become insigniﬁcant beyond 50 Å. This study did not negate the possibility of longer range hydrophobic force in neat water. Recently Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) measurements established the existence of short-range force with correlation lengths of 3–7 Å. 13–15
One of the signatures of the short ranged hydrophobic interactions is drying/dewetting transition.16 When two large hydrophobic surfaces immersed in water approach each other, coalescences take place between them at a particular inter-surface separation (i.e., known as critical distance (dc)). Water is in a metastable state with respect to its vapor at that particular distance. This phenomenon is known as drying transition. This drying/dewetting transition is essentially dependent on the thermodynamic conditions of the system and on the nature of hydrophobic surfaces. There are several theoretical and experimental studies in literature regarding the possible mechanism/origin of attractive hydrophobic force law (HFL) and about the detailed understanding (i.e., thermodynamics and kinetic pathways) of the de-wetting transition.17–33 However, the quantitative

understanding of such hydrophobic force remains somewhat unclear.
Theoretical understanding of hydrophobic interaction was based on a theory proposed by Pratt and Chandler, where the solute-solvent interaction was treated perturbatively.34 Subsequently, an elegant microscopic density functional theory (DFT) was proposed by Lum et al.,16 to illustrate the origin of HFL. This theory semiquantitatively explains the attractive hydrophobic force law between two hydrophobic objects at small and large length scales.
However, a few earlier theoretical studies, using molecular dynamics simulations, have focused on the phase behavior of conﬁned water particularly by varying the thermodynamic conditions of the systems. In an important simulation study, Parker et al., studied the temperature effects on the attractive forces between two hydrophobic surfaces.35 Their calculation revealed that there is a remarkable enhancement in the strength of attractive hydrophobic force upon heating/increasing temperature of the system. Subsequently, in another study, Berne and co-workers22 investigated the temperature dependent associations and drying transitions of hydrophobic solutes. Their study revealed that the critical dewetting distance increases with increase in the temperature of the system. Recently, Debenedetti and co-workers36,37 also examined the structural behavior of conﬁned water molecules between the extended surfaces at different thermodynamic conditions. From the density proﬁle analysis, they concluded that conﬁned water becomes more structured upon pressurization or cooling. Importantly, they found that the effective hydrophobicity of the surfaces decreases upon pressurization or cooling of the system because of vapor phase suppression. In the recent past, considerable amount of investigations have been devoted to the hydrophobicity induced evaporation/condensation transition of the conﬁned water through computer simulation studies which have several technological applications.38–41
In this work, we report the effect of temperature on the strength/range of hydrophobic force law (HFL) and on the drying/dewetting transition in terms of number density ﬂuctuations of water conﬁned between two graphene-like surfaces using computer simulations. The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we present the simulation details. This is followed by a discussion of detailed calculations and results of the hydrophobic force law of water between two hydrophobic surfaces at different thermodynamic conditions in section 3. We construct the density proﬁle of water molecules to describe the temperature dependent structural modiﬁcation of the conﬁned water. Additionally, in order to further analyze the water structure

inside the conﬁnement, we calculate the local tetrahedral order parameter proﬁles for different temperatures. We compute the isothermal compressibility of the conﬁned water molecules to determine the effect of temperature on the critical dewetting distance. Thereafter, we brieﬂy summarize our results in section 4.
2. Simulation details
Simulations are performed using Large-scale Atomic/ Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) MD packages. In this study, we use extended single point charge water (SPC/E) model. 42 We use a cubic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions applied in all three directions. We create the two hydrophobic walls (represented by a rigid, hexagonal, lattice of Lennard-Jones (LJ) atoms with a lattice constant of 1.4 Å) of dimension 19.6 × 19.4 Å2 (for simplicity, we refer to this as 20 × 20 Å2 surface) by mimicking the arrangements of carbon atoms in a graphene sheet. There is a gas-like density area of typically 2–3 Å width near each wall. The walls are non-interacting between each other. The two hydrophobic walls are oriented parallel to each other and also parallel to the XY plane (shown in Figure 1). The walls are immersed in water (i.e. with respect to the centre of the box) at the desired distance (d) by replacing certain water molecules present within contact distance. The force ﬁeld parameters for wall-water interactions are taken from Ref. 29. We examine the distance dependence of the hydrophobic effects by performing a set of simulations with an inter-wall separation distance (d), ranging from 7 to 30 Å. To avoid any artefacts due to periodic boundary conditions, we use sufﬁciently large box size. The number of water molecules varies in our simulations depending on the inter-wall separations. For example,

J. Chem. Sci. (2018) 130:29

Page 3 of 10 29

in case of small inter-wall separation (d = 7 − 20 Å), we use 7200 water molecules (box size ∼ 60 Å × 60 Å × 60 Å), whereas for large (d = 25–30 Å) inter-wall separation ∼ 9500 water molecules (box size ∼ 67 Å × 67 Å × 67 Å) are
required to fully solvate the box.
We perform the MD simulations in the isothermal-isobaric
ensemble (NPT) at 1 bar pressure and at various constant temperatures (T = 240 K, 270 K, 300 K, 330 K and 360 K), by using the Nosé -Hoover 43,44 barostat and thermostat. The system is then equilibrated for 105 steps at constant temperature and volume, with each time step τ = 2 fs. The production run is carried out for 107 steps at constant temperature and
volume.
The particle–particle particle–Mesh (PPPM) Ewald
method is used to compute long-range corrections of electrostatic interactions. The k-space is taken to be 0.0001 Å−1, and calculations are performed on a 15 × 15 × 15 grid, with rms precision of 4 × 10−5, which are the standard PPPM
Ewald parameters in LAMMPS. We use a 10Å cut-off value
for the Lennard–Jones interactions.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1 Calculation of effective hydrophobic force between the walls

To explore the effects of hydrophobic walls on each other, we calculate the resultant force between the two walls in the following manner. First, we consider the water molecules which are conﬁned between the two hydrophobic walls and also outside the walls. We project the forces obtained from these water molecules along the inter-wall separation axis i.e., Z -axis. The force between the two walls is ﬁnally obtained as Fcav(d) = FL − FR, where FL and FR are forced on the left and the right walls respectively. It is worth mentioning here, that each wall experience forces exerted by both the conﬁned water molecules from inside and bulk water molecules from outside. To obtain the force, ﬁrst, we have to calculate the pressure on each wall. Now, pressure on the walls45–47 can be calculated from the well-known virial equation,

Pw

=

NkBT V

+

i ri fi DV

(1)

where N is the number of atoms in the system, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, D (= 3) is

the dimensionality of the system, ri is the position vector of the ith particle and fi is the total internal force on the ith particle. In Eq. 1, the second term is the virial,

arising from the intermolecular interactions. To obtain

the pressure on each wall, we use the following deﬁ-
nition, Pw = PwO + PwI , where w is L for left wall and R for right wall, PwO is the pressure perpendicular to the wth wall from outside and PwI is the same from

inside. Then we multiply the pressure on each wall by the respective surface areas to get the force exerted on the walls. Finally, the effective force (F) between the walls is obtained as, F = Fcav(d) − F∞, where F∞ is the force at inﬁnite separation between the two walls and obtained by ﬁtting the distance dependent Fcav.
Figure 2 shows the effective hydrophobic force between two hydrophobic walls as a function of temperature of the system, for three ﬁxed inter-wall separations (d). We ﬁnd that the magnitude of effective hydrophobic force between two surfaces increases with the increase in temperature of the system. For all the studied temperatures, the effective force between two hydrophobic surfaces decreases as the inter-wall separation between the two hydrophobic walls increases.
The negative force indicates an effective attraction between the walls, induced by the intervening water molecules. As shown in Figure 3, the attractive force between the hydrophobic walls increases bi-exponentially with decrease of d. Several scientists, notably Israelachvilli et al.,8,10 observed such strong attractions between the hydrophobic surfaces. We ﬁnd that the range of effective hydrophobic force increases with decrease in temperature of the system (Table 1).
This effective force can be ﬁtted by the following equation

F = aF1 exp(−d/ξF1 ) + aF2 exp(−d/ξF2 ).

(2)

where d is the inter-wall distance, aF1, aF2 , ξF1 and ξF2 are ﬁtting parameters. The ﬁtting parameters are provided in Table 1.
In the long-range limit (in the context of the present simulations), the prediction of correlation length is in good agreement with the experiments of Israelachvili et

al.8 This is also consistent with the experimental ﬁndings of Pashley and co-workers,48 where they have found that the attractive forces between planar, uncharged hydrophobic surfaces (in water solution) have a correlation length of about 15 Å.
The semi-log plot of attractive force shown in Figure 4 clearly depicts the two distinctly different regions and shows a crossover49 between the two regimes. This resembles the de-wetting/drying phenomenon which was predicted by earlier theoretical studies.16,20,22,23 When the water-surface interactions fail to reasonably account for the lost water-water interactions at an interface then there is a free energy drive for phase separation and interfacial collapse.
As shown in Figure 4, the semi-log plot of effective force shows a sharp crossover near 12–14 Å inter-wall separations for 300 K, whereas, for 270 K this crossover is noticed around 11 Å of inter-wall separation. We ﬁnd that the sharp crossover between the two regions shifts to lower value of d upon cooling. Similar to several recent experimental ﬁndings,13–15 we also ﬁnd that one more crossover is possible near 5 Å (not shown here) of separations between two hydrophobic walls where hardly

any volume (except single ﬁle) of water molecules exist. This is expected on physical grounds as water molecules may be forced out by direct attraction between two walls.
From this study, we observe the reduction of effective hydrophobicity of plates upon cooling. This is mainly because of the fact that lowering of temperature increases the effective attraction of the water molecules towards hydrophobic surfaces and subsequently the effective hydrophobicity of the wall reduces. This phenomenon was also reported in the previous studies. 35,37,50,51

3.2 Density proﬁle

In order to understand the attractive force between two hydrophobic surfaces, several prior theoretical studies focused on the density-dependent theories.16,34 In our study we also investigate the structural behavior of the conﬁned water molecules. To study the effect of temperature on the water structure we calculate the water density proﬁle at different inter-wall separations (Figure 5). Water molecules within the cavity are in dynamical equilibrium with the outside bulk molecules. Finally, the density of water molecules conﬁned between two hydrophobic walls31 is calculated using the standard formula given by,

ρcav

=

Ncav Vcav

(3)

where conﬁned volume is deﬁned as, Vcav = d A and A is the area of the surface.N is the average number of

water molecules present in the volume Vcav.

Figure 5. Local normalized density proﬁle (ρ(Z )/ρbulk ) of water for different inter-wall separations d, (a) d = 10 Å, (b) d = 20 Å and (c) d = 30 Å for T = 270 K and T = 300 K. The thick grey lines are the schematic representation of the two hydrophobic walls.
In this calculation, we deﬁne the distance (Z ) dependent density, ρ(Z ), by following a coarse-graining where we divide the whole cavity region into small boxes. The region conﬁned between two hydrophobic

plates is sub-divided into several small grids and the center of each grid represents the distance from the left wall (Z ). We use a similar coarse-grain procedure to calculate the distance (Z ) dependent density for the outside regions of the hydrophobic walls. Symmetric nature of the conﬁnement suggests that two grids located at the same distance from the respective walls should have the same local density. We therefore improve statistics by averaging over the small boxes at the same Z value.
As shown in Figure 5, the maxima of ρ(Z ) become sharper upon cooling indicating the enhancement of water structure. The multiple layered structures formed by water molecules between the two hydrophobic walls are manifested in the oscillations of density proﬁle along Z -direction. The surface-induced layering of water molecules inside the conﬁnement increases on lowering the temperature of the system. Figure 5(c) shows the pronounced effect of lowering temperature at large inter-wall separation. For all the different temperatures studied, at large inter-wall separation, the conﬁned water density approaches that of the bulk value. We further observe with the decrease in temperature of the system, the peak of ρ(Z ) closest to each hydrophobic wall exhibits slight asymmetrical broadening toward the hydrophobic plates.
From the density proﬁle analyses, we observe that both the number and layering of water molecules between the hydrophobic walls increase with a decrease in temperature of the system. These observations indicate that, as we reduce the temperature of the system, the hydrophobic surfaces become more attractive towards water molecules and consequently the effective hydrophobicity of hydrophobic walls decreases.
It is clearly seen from Figure 5 that the structure of water molecules in the conﬁned region is different from that outside. This is because of the conﬁnement-induced ordering that is partly absent outside the hydrophobic surfaces. Hydrophobic force law (HFL) arises due to the interaction between the density inhomogeneity created by the two surfaces (gas-like density near each surface) that propagates inward from the surfaces.
Figure 6 shows that for three ﬁxed inter-wall separation of hydrophobic walls, the normalized cavity density of water molecules increases upon cooling. It was already reported in the literature that the conﬁned water density increases substantially with a decrease in temperature for hydrophobic conﬁnement as opposed to hydrophilic conﬁnement.37
In the simulation, water molecules remain in the liquid phase in the region outside the conﬁnement of the hydrophobic walls, for all the studied temperatures (i.e., from 240 K to 360 K). In Figures S1 and S3, we show some representative snapshots of the simulations

at low temperatures. The random ordering of the water molecules (i.e., the absence of any ordered hexagonal ice-like rings) in the conﬁned water establishes the liquid state of water at low temperatures. It is to be noted that phase diagram of SPC/E water shows the existence of liquid water from 240 K to 360 K temperature range.52,53

3.3 Orientational proﬁle

The density of water is partly slaved to the orientation of the water molecules (by H-bond network). Thus, we analyze the conﬁned structure of water molecules between two large hydrophobic surfaces by calculating the orientational order parameter. In order to understand the relative orientation of water molecules within the hydrophobic conﬁnement, we consider a different (but well-known) order parameter, namely the local tetrahedral order parameter which is described as54:

th = 1 − 8

cos ψ jk + 3 .

(4)

j=1 k= j+1

For perfect tetrahedral arrangement the reaches its maximum value unity and for a non-interacting system, the average value of th is zero. This parameter can be employed to analyze the local structure or packing. Similar to the calculations of density proﬁle we calculate the tetrahedral order parameter proﬁle in coarse-graining method.
In Figure 7, we plot the average local tetrahedral order parameter of the conﬁned water molecules in each grid as a function of Z.
In case of large inter-wall separation (d), the local tetrahedral order parameter value increases and local water structure becomes bulk-like in the center of the

inter-wall separations d, (a) d = 10 Å, (b) d = 20 Å and
(c) d = 30 Å, for temperatures T = 270 K, T = 300 K and T = 330 K. The bulk values of tetrahedral order parameter for different temperatures are, th = 0.71 (at 270 K); th = 0.64 (at 300 K); and th = 0.55 (at 330 K).

conﬁned region for all the studied temperatures (Figure 7(c)). The average local tetrahedral order parameter value increases in regions progressively closer to the plates with a decrease in temperature of the system. For all the studied temperatures, the number of H-bonds in the middle of the conﬁned region almost approaches the bulk value that results in the increase in the value of local tetrahedral order parameter. The low value of average local tetrahedral order parameter nearby the walls is because of the fact that the number of H-bonds among the water molecules is reduced by the presence of the walls.
Similar to that of density, orientational proﬁles also indicate the enhancement of local structure of cavity water molecules with a decrease in temperature of the system. As shown in Figure 8, for ﬁxed interwall separations, the enhancement of tetrahedral order parameter essentially suggests the extent of formation of the more ordered tetrahedral structure of conﬁned water molecules upon cooling. This is because of the fact that increases in temperature of the system causes a decrease in the number of H-bonds of the water molecules inside the conﬁnement. The orientaional heterogeneity across the walls is the origin for the long-range hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic surfaces.45,49
The liquid phase of water molecules at low temperatures (i.e., 240 K and 270 K) is further veriﬁed by calculating the Steinhardt bond order (local) parameter (Q6)55 for water molecules of interest. The distributions of the local order parameters and their average values suggest that water remains in the liquid phase at low temperatures (Figures S2 and S4 in Supplementary Information).

Figure 9. Local compressibility of conﬁned water calculated from number density ﬂuctuations in the water conﬁned within the three-dimensional box formed by the two walls, for T = 270 K, T = 300 K and T = 330 K. The local compressibility is plotted against the distance of separation d between the two plates.

3.4 Local isothermal compressibility

In our study, as discussed above, two walls are immersed within the water. There exists an area that represents gas-like density near each surface, which is typically 2– 3 Å wide. The decrease in the number of H-bonds near the extended hydrophobic surfaces causes the water to move away from the surfaces, producing a thin vaporlike layer. This causes ﬂuctuations at the interfaces and expels the remaining liquid between these surfaces (when they are sufﬁciently close to each other).
In order to explore the crossover observed in the attractive hydrophobic force, we compute one of the important response functions, isothermal compressibility. From this response function, we can precisely investigate the effect of temperature on such crossover. Local compressibility is deﬁned as,

χncav =

n2cav − ncav 2 ncav

(5)

where ncav is the number of water molecules inside the cavity of volume V in between the two hydrophobic walls.
The local compressibility of the conﬁned water molecules goes through a maximum (Figure 9), which suggests the crossover from a gas like a region to a liquid like a region. The divergent like behavior in the local compressibility indicates that system passes through a free energy minimum.
In Figure 9, we observe that the drying transition occurs near d ∼ 13–14 Å for 330 K temperature, d ∼

29 Page 8 of 10

J. Chem. Sci. (2018) 130:29

12 Å for 300 K temperature, and d ∼ 11 Å for 270 K temperature. We ﬁnd that the critical inter-wall separation (dc) changes to lower value of d upon cooling. This observation is in good agreement with the earlier studies by Berne and co-workers.18,50 The estimate of critical de-wetting distance at 300 K is also consistent with the study of Zhou et al.56 They found that the critical de-wetting transition between two hydrophobic surfaces takes place at d ∼ 12 Å, in pure water.
At 300 K temperature, the number of conﬁned water molecules, n(cwavater) starts increasing slowly with the increase in the inter-wall separation (d), from 7 Å onwards, and it jumps to a large value (approximately 85) at d = 12 Å, then again it continues to increase gradually upto 30 Å. The small number of water molecules at d < 12 Å indicates that a vapor phase is dominant between the two hydrophobic walls (i.e., conﬁned water molecules are unstable in its liquid state) (shown in Figure S5). On the other hand, at d ≥ 12 Å water molecules form a liquid phase in the conﬁnement. A similar phenomenon is also observed for other temperatures corresponding to their critical de-wetting distances. We ﬁnd that at an inter-wall separation d < 7 Å (∼ 5 Å), complete drying is observed with hardly any volume of water molecules between the walls.
4. Conclusions
The hydrophobic interaction plays a crucial role in protein and micellar aggregation, lipid bilayer formation and other biological self-organizing processes.57,58 Hydrophobic force arises because of long-range interactions between the hydrophobic surfaces. While, the initial landmark experiments by Israelachvili et al.,8,9 indicated a rather long ranged attractive hydrophobic force, later experiments seem to propose a somewhat shorter ranged force. Clearly, the range of the force shall depend strongly on the nature of the roughness of the surfaces, and also on the thermodynamic conditions of the system.
In this work, we present the direct calculation of the strength/range of attractive hydrophobic force and phase behavior of water molecules conﬁned (i.e., liquid) between two hydrophobic walls at different thermodynamic conditions. As shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4, we ﬁnd that there is a signiﬁcant change in the magnitude of the effective attractive force between two hydrophobic surfaces and in a correlation length of HFL upon cooling. The correlation length/range of effective hydrophobic force increases on lowering the temperature. The effective hydrophobic force exhibits bi-exponential distance dependence that shows two

length scales of hydrophobicity. While the smaller correlation length at small separation d can be understood easily in terms of the gas-like state of the system at those values of d, the larger correlation of 20 Å at larger d can be regarded as a persistence length of density ﬂuctuations. A sharp crossover between the two regimes in the distance dependence of attractive force (Figure 4) is further reﬂected in the divergent-like growth of the local isothermal compressibility of the conﬁned water molecules (Figure 9). The crossover from shorter range to longer-range force is rather sharp, reminding one of a ‘drying/dewetting transition’. This study reveals that the critical dewetting distance, which was predicted by several earlier theoretical studies,16,23,34 decreases to lower value of d with a decrease in temperature (Figures 4 and 9).
The present work demonstrates that there is a weakening of the effective hydrophobicity of the surfaces upon cooling. This phenomenon has important consequences on the thermodynamic/structural properties of the conﬁned water. From the density calculations, we ﬁnd that the structure of water molecules in the conﬁned region is dissimilar from that of outside region (Figure 5). Both the water density and layering of water molecules inside the conﬁnement increase on lowering the temperature of the system (Figures 5 and 6). Furthermore, the present study brings out the role of molecular orientation (tetrahedral order parameter of conﬁned water molecules) in deﬁning the HFL. The increase in the local tetrahedral order parameter value upon cooling signiﬁes the enhancement of microscopic structure (i.e., tetrahedral arrangements) of water molecules in conﬁnement (as shown in Figures 7 and 8). Finally, we conclude this by noting that hydrophobic walls become more attractive toward the water molecules upon cooling.
