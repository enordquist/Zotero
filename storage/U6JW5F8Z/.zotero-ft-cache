Summary
W e have used affinity panning of libraries of bacterio-
phages that display random octapeptide or dodeca-
peptide sequences at the N-terminus of the adsorption
protein (pill) to characterize peptides that bind to the
endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP and to develop
a scoring system that predicts potential BiP-binding
sequences in naturally occurring polypeptides. BiP
preferentially binds peptides containing a subset of
aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids in alternating
positions, suggesting that peptides bind in an ex-
tended conformation, with the side chains of alternat-
ing residues pointing into a cleft on the BiP molecule.
Synthetic peptides with sequences corresponding to
those displayed by BiP-binding bacteriophages bind
to BiP and stimulate its ATPase activity, with a half-
maximal concentration in the range lo-60 FM.
Introduction
The molecular chaperone BiP, the sole member of the
hsp70 protein family localized in the endoplasmic reticu-
lum (ER) of eukaryotic cells (for review see Gething and
Sambrook, 1992) is required for translocation of newly
synthesized polypeptides across the ER membrane (Vo-
gel et al., 1990; Nguyen et al., 1991; Sanders et al., 1992)
and for their subsequent folding and assembly in the ER
lumen (Schonberger et al., 1991; Gething and Sambrook,
1992). The role of BiP as a chaperone depends on its
ability to recognize a wide variety of nascent polypeptides
that share no obvious sequence similarity, while accu-
rately discriminating between properly folded and un-
folded structures. In vitro, binding of some, but not all,
short synthetic peptides stimulates the ATPase activity of
BiP (Flynn et al., 1989; 1991) and alters its oligomericstate
(Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993). The affinities for BiP of a

small set of randomly chosen synthetic peptides varied
over a lOOO-fold range, but no obvious correlation was
apparent between the sequences of these peptides and
their association constants (Flynn et al., 1989). Bulk se-
quencing of a population of water-soluble heptameric pep-
tides eluted from BiP with acid showed them to be enriched
in aliphatic amino acids, particularly at positions 3-6
(Flynn et al., 1991). Unfortunately, because of the limita-
tions imposed by the methods used, no data were avail-
able for the amino acid composition of position 1 of the
peptide population, nor for the abundance of glycine (Gly),
cysteine (Cys), or tryptophan (Trp) at any position, and
it was impossible to identify the sequences of individual
peptides whose affinities for BiP could be directly mea-
sured.
W e chose to investigate the characteristics of peptides
that bind to BiP using affinity screening of large, highly
diverse libraries of peptides expressed on the surface of
bacteriophage fd particles. This powerful technique (for
review see Scott and Smith, 1990; Dower, 1992; Scott,
1992; Smith, 1991) is based on the ability of filamentous
bacteriophages to display foreign peptides on their outer
surfaces and involves the specific screening and affinity
purification of bacteriophages displaying peptides that are
ligands for a particular protein (Parmley and Smith, 1988).
Peptides fused to the N-termini of the four to five copies
of the pill protein of bacteriophage fd are displayed at one
tip of each bacteriophage particle and have little or no
effect on viral infectivity (Scott and Smith, 1990; Dower,
1992; Devlin et al., 1990). Bacteriophage display has the
following advantages over studies with random synthetic
peptides: the peptides are fused to the bacteriophage pro-
teins, minimizing peptide solubility problems; the se-
quences of individual peptides can be easily deduced by
DNA sequencing of the appropriate coding region of the
bacteriophage genome, an approach that avoids technical
problems encountered during amino acid sequence analy-
sis, such as the inability to analyze certain residues or
positions of the peptide; and peptides corresponding to
individual bacteriophage-displayed sequences can be
synthesized and their activities assayed directly.
To study the binding specificity of BiP, we utilized two
bacteriophage libraries with random octapeptide or do-
decapeptide inserts at the N-terminus of the pill protein.
Affinity panning of the octapeptide library with immobilized
murine BiP yielded a population of bacteriophages that
display peptides whose sequences, when compared with
those of peptides displayed by unselected bacterio-
phages, define a heptameric consensus motif that can
be used to predict BiP-binding sites in natural proteins.
Heptameric sequences conforming to the consensus motif
were present within the dodecapeptides displayed on bac-
teriophages independently selected from the second li-
brary and within synthetic peptides known to bind to BiP
(Flynn et al., 1989; Oblas et al., 1990). The diversity of
sequences of BiP-binding peptides is consistent with the
ability of BiP to interact with a wide variety of unrelated

Figure 1. Amino Acid Sequences of Octapeptides Displayed by
ON141 Bacteriophages Picked before or after Selection for Ability to
Bind to BiP
Single-stranded D N A was purified from 114 bacteriophage clones from
the original ON141 library, from 34 ATP-1 and 80 ATP-2 clones were
obtained by ATP elution after one or two rounds of affinity panning in
the presence of BiP, and from 22 acid-3 cloneswere obtained by acidic
elution after three rounds of affinity panning. The sequences of the
octapeptides displayed by these bacteriophages were deduced from
the D N A sequence of the corresponding region of the bacteriophage
genome. Many of the sequences of the octapeptides from BiP-binding
bacteriophages have been shifted by one amino acid position to pro-
vide the optimal alignment that reveals the heptameric BiP-binding
motif in positions defined as numbers 2-8. This final alignment was
achieved by an iterative procedure. The first alignment was done such
as to maximize the frequency of occurrences of Trp, Phe, and Leu
residues in the even-numbered positions in the 114 ATP-1 and ATP-2
peptides. Scores such as those shown below the histogram columns
in Figure 4 were assigned to each of the possible 20 amino acids at
each position in the seven residue core sequence based on the relative
frequencies with which particular amino acids occur at particular posi-
tions in BiP-binding heptapeptides and in randomly selected heptapep
tides. This scoring matrix was used in conjunction with the BiP Score
program (see Experimental Procedures) to calculate the overall score
for each of the two seven residue sequences present in the ATP-1
and ATP-2 peptides, and the few peptides whose alternative alignment
gave a higher score were identified. After adjusting the alignment of
these peptides, the numbers of each of the amino acids at positions

Displayed by the Library of ON141 Bacteriophages
(A) Single-stranded D N A was purified from 114 bacteriophage clones
from the ON141 library, and the sequences of the octapeptides dis-
played by these bacteriophages were deduced from the D N A se-
quence of the corresponding region of the bacteriophage genome.
The figure shows the frequency of occurrence of each amino acid
calculated as the number observed divided by the total number of
residues in the 114 octapeptides. The amino acids are grouped ac-
cording to the number of codons that specify them (Cwirla et al., 1990)
and the frequency expected for each group if all codons were utilized
with equal efficiency is shown by the dotted line. (B) The overall amino
acid composition of 114 octapeptides from BiP-binding ON141 bacte-
riophages was compared with that of the same number of octapeptides
from clones picked randomly from the ON141 starting library. The fold
increase or fold decrease in the abundance of each amino acid in the
selected versus unselected populations is shown. The results for Gln
and Cys are less certain because the poor representation of these
residues in the starting library (A) reduces the reliability of the data.
nascent polypeptides; their marked hydrophobicity is con-
sistent with the likelihood that BiP interacts with se-
quences normally located in the interior of a fully folded
protein.

were recalculated. After two rounds of this process, every peptide was
aligned such that the core heptapeptide sequence (overlined at the
top of the columns) gave the largest of the two scores possible for the
octapeptide. For each peptide, this larger score is listed. Peptides
displayed by bacteriophages that were stained most intensely in the
nitrocellulose filter assays are marked with a triple plus sign.
