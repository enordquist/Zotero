Figure S1. RMSD plot of the backbone atoms of CDK2.
The RMSD calculation was performed on the Cα atoms CDK2 over 100 ns of MD simulations for the a) unbound form, and the bound form complexed with b) LQ5, c) IQ2 and d) IQ3. The gray boxes in each graph represent the equilibration time and, hence, it was not considered for further analysis.

Figure S2. RMSD plot of the backbone atoms of VEGFR2.
The RMSD calculation was performed on the Cα atoms VEGFR2 over 100 ns of MD simulations for the a) unbound form, and the bound form complexed with b) BAX, c) IQ2 and d) IQ3. The gray boxes in each graph represent the equilibration time and, hence, it was not considered for further analysis.

Figure S3. Intermolecular H-bond plots for CDK2.
Observed interactions between CDK2 and a) LQ5, b) IQ2 and c) IQ3 over 100 ns of MD simulations. The presence or absence of each h-bond interaction during the simulation time is depicted as black and white lines, respectively. The side-chains of the CDK2 residues involved in h-bonding are depicted as light green sticks and the h-bonds as cyan continuous lines (d). LQ5 is represented by gold sticks and the virtual candidates IQ2 and IQ3 by dark blue and red wires, correspondingly.
