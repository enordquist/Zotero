ABSTRACT Intracellular Mg21 at physiological concentrations activates mSlo1 BK channels by binding to a metal-binding site in the cytosolic domain. Previous studies suggest that residues E374, Q397, and E399 are important in Mg21 binding. In the present study, we show that mutations of E374 or E399 to other amino acids, except for Asp, abolish Mg21 sensitivity. These results further support that the side chains of E374 and E399 are essential for Mg21 coordination. To the contrary, none of the Q397 mutations abolishes Mg21 sensitivity, suggesting that its side chain may not coordinate to Mg21. However, because Q397 is spatially close to E374 and E399, its mutations affect the Mg21 sensitivity of channel gating by either reducing or increasing the Mg21 binding afﬁnity. The pattern of mutational effects and the effect of chemical modiﬁcation of Q397C indicate that Q397 is involved in the Mg21-dependent activation of BK channels and that mutations of Q397 alter Mg21 sensitivity by affecting the conformation of the Mg21 binding site as well as by electrostatic interactions with the bound Mg21 ion.

INTRODUCTION
BK-type K1 channels are activated by voltage and intracellular Ca21. This unique property of the BK channel activation makes it important in physiological processes in various cell types (1–15). Because BK channels have a large single-channel conductance, their opening hyperpolarizes membranes with high efﬁciency, resulting in the closure of voltage-dependent Ca21 channels and hence decreasing [Ca21]i. Thus, BK channels provide a negative feedback in controlling the membrane potential and [Ca21]i. Based on this mechanism, BK channels modulate various physiological processes including neural excitation (5,11,16–19), muscle contraction (8,15,20–23), hearing (24–27), and immunity (28).
Apart from Ca21, the function of BK channels is also modulated by intracellular Mg21 (29–40). Mg21 modulates a variety of Ca21 and K1 channels to affect the excitability or excitation-contraction coupling in neurons, cardiac myocytes, and smooth muscle cells (41–47). Following central nervous system injury, [Mg21]i is signiﬁcantly reduced, contributing to a number of factors including neurotransmitter release and oxidative stress that initiate an autodestructive cascade of biochemical and pathophysiological changes, known as secondary injury, that ultimately result in irreversible tissue damage (48). Pharmacological studies have shown that Mg21 may be an effective therapeutic agent following neurotrauma to improve survival and motor outcome and to alleviate cognitive deﬁcits (48). Magnesium supplements are also important in the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases that predispose to hypertension or congestive heart failure (49,50). Because of the importance of BK channels in neurotransmitter release and vascular tone, Mg21 modulation

of BK channels may play a substantial role in these pathophyisological processes.
BK channels are encoded by Slo1 genes (51–56) and possess common structural features of voltage-gated K1 channels. Each Slo1 protein contains a pore domain formed by S5-S6 transmembrane segments and a voltage-sensing domain formed by S0-S4 transmembrane segments (Fig. 1). In addition, a long cytosolic carboxyl terminus forms the Ca21 and Mg21 sensing module (57), which may adopt a similar structure as the cytosolic domain of the K1 channel in E. coli and an archeon Ca21-activated K1 channel, MthK (58,59). Previous studies have shown that site-directed mutations of mSlo1 E374A, E399N, and Q397C either abolish or reduce Mg21 sensitivity of channel activation (38,40). In models based on the x-ray crystallographic structures of the K1 channel in E. coli (38) and of MthK, these three residues locate closely (Fig. 1) and can form a metal-binding site (38). However, the roles of these residues in Mg21 sensitivity, such as whether they are the ligands for the Mg21 binding site, and how the mutations E374A, E399N, or Q397C affected Mg21 sensitivity are not clear. On the other hand, the putative Mg21 binding site formed by these residues is located in the cytosolic domain, whereas the activation gate is located in the membrane-spanning domain (Fig. 1). The structural separation between the binding site and the activation gate indicates that Mg21 binding activates the channel by an allosteric mechanism; i.e., Mg21 binding may cause a conformational change at the binding site that propagates to the activation gate for channel opening. Such conformational changes have not been explored.
In this study we mutated each of the three residues, E374, E399, and Q397, into amino acids of different chemical properties and examined the activation of mutant channels. We found that mutation of E374 or E399 to any amino acid except Asp abolishes Mg21 sensitivity, a result that is consistent with these two residues being the ligands for the Mg21 binding site. However, none of the mutations of Q397

abolished Mg21 sensitivity. Rather, Mg21 sensitivity decreased when Q397 is mutated to neutral or positively charged residues, whereas it increased when Q397 is mutated to negatively charged residues. These results suggest that the side chain of Q397 may not be the ligand for the binding site but is close to the binding site so that the Mg21 sensitivity of channel activation can be tuned by mutating Q397 into different amino acids. We also studied the chemical modiﬁcation of Q397C mutant channels. The results suggest that the mutations alter Mg21 sensitivity by affecting the conformation of the Mg21 binding site as well as by electrostatic interactions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clones, mutagenesis, and channel expression
All channel constructs were made from the mbr5 clone of mSlo1 (60) using PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR-ampliﬁed regions of all mutants were veriﬁed by sequencing. RNA was transcribed in vitro with T3 polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX). We injected 0.05–50 ng of RNA into each Xenopus laevis oocyte 2–6 days before recording.
Electrophysiology
Macroscopic currents were recorded from inside-out patches formed with borosilicate pipettes of ;1–2 MV resistance. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200-B patch-clamp ampliﬁer (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) and pulse acquisition software (HEKA Electronik, Southboro, MA). Records were digitized at 20-ms intervals and low-pass ﬁltered at 10 kHz with the 4-pole Bessel ﬁlter built into the ampliﬁer. The pipette solution contained the following (in mM): 140 potassium methanesulfonic acid, 20 HEPES, 2 KCl, and 2 MgCl2, pH 7.20. The basal internal solution contains the following (in mM): 140 potassium methanesulfonic acid, 20 HEPES, 2 KCl, and 1 EGTA, pH 7.20. MgCl2 was added to the internal solution to give the appropriate free [Mg21]i, and 50 mM 18-crown-6-tetracarboxylic acid (18-C-6-T, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to internal solutions to prevent Ba21 block. Experiments were conducted at room temperature (;22ÿ24°C).
Structural model
The homology structural model of the mSlo1 channel (bB to bC) based on the crystal structure of the MthK channel (58) was produced using the PyMol molecular graphics system (http://www.pymol.org) (61). E374, Q397, and E399 of the mSlo1 channel correspond to E138, G156, and N158 of the MthK channel. The SWISS-PDB Viewer (62) was used to generate

Analysis and model ﬁtting

Relative conductance was determined by measuring tail current amplitudes at ÿ50 mV for the WT and mutant mSlo1 channels. The conductancevoltage (G-V) relations of the WT and mutant channels were ﬁtted with a Boltzmann equation:

where z is the number of equivalent charges, V½ is the voltage for a channel in half activation, e is the elementary charge, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and
T is the absolute temperature. For model ﬁttings of E399D, Q397K, Q397E, and Q397C, the G-V relations of the mutant channels at various [Mg21]i and 0 [Ca21]i were ﬁtted with Eq. 2 in Results. Curve ﬁttings were done with Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) using the Levenberg-
Marquardt algorithm to perform nonlinear least-squares ﬁts. The means of
the data were obtained by averaging from 4 to 16 patches, and error bars
represent standard error of means.

Chemical modiﬁcation
MTSET ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, ON, Canada), dissolved in water at 100 mM, and stored at ÿ80°C. An aliquot of MTSET stock solution was thawed and diluted 500-fold into the appropriate internal solution immediately before use. Currents were recorded after 2.5 min of MTSET treatment and 0.5 min of washing.

RESULTS
We ﬁrst examined the effects of E374 mutations on the
activation of mSlo1 channels. Fig. 2 shows the comparison
of the WT mSlo1 activation with that of mutant channels
E374R, E374K, E374D, E374A, E374Q, and E374W. It is obvious that the Mg21 sensitivity of mutant E374A is signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 2 A). Addition of 10 mM Mg21 resulted in a shift of the G-V relation ÿ67.39 6 1.86 mV for the WT mSlo1 channel but only ÿ12.51 6 2.60 mV for E374A (Fig. 2 A). Our previous studies demonstrated that the channel is activated by two independent Mg21 binding sites, one with high afﬁnity (Kd ¼ 5.46 mM when channel is closed and 2.25 mM when channel is open) and the other with low afﬁnity (Kd ¼ 136.1 mM when channel is closed and 40.1 mM when channel is open). Mutations of E374,
E399, or Q397 affect only the high-afﬁnity binding site but have no effects on the low-afﬁnity site (63). We use a model
for channel activation (63) to calculate the amount of the G-V shift related to Mg21 binding to the low-afﬁnity site at 10
mM (Eq. 2 and Table 1). This value is then subtracted from
the G-V shift measured experimentally (gray bar in Fig. 2 C), which gives rise to the remaining Mg21 sensitivity mediated by the high-afﬁnity Mg21 binding site (black bar in Fig. 2 C). The result shows that mutation E374A completely abolishes Mg21 sensitivity through the high-afﬁnity Mg21 binding site
(Fig. 2 C). Fig. 2, B and C, shows that another mutation,

for Mg21 sensitivity. This result is consistent with E374 being part of the high-afﬁnity Mg21 binding site. Both Asp and Glu
residues at position 374 are able to provide coordination for Mg21 binding, whereas other residues, regardless of their size or hydrophobicity, destroy Mg21 binding.
We also examined the effects of E399 mutations on the
activation of mSlo1 channels. Fig. 3 shows the comparison of
the WT mSlo1 activation with that of mutant channels E399R,
E399D, E399N, E399Q, and E399W. Similar to E374, mu-
tation of E399 to any amino acid other than Asp destroys Mg21 sensitivity, indicating that the carboxylate on this residue is also essential for Mg21 sensitivity. Multiple compar-
ison with Tukey’s test indicates that the result of E399D in
Fig. 3 C is signiﬁcantly different from the result of the other
mutants (.95% conﬁdence level). Although Mg21 sensitivity is retained in both E374D and
E399D mutant channels, it is signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 2, B and C, Fig. 3 B and C). In order to examine the Mg21 sen-
sitivity reduction in more detail, we measured G-V relations of E399D in various [Mg21]i between 0 and 100 mM at 0 [Ca21]i and ﬁtted the data with Eq. 2 (Fig. 4 A):

A 10 mM increase in [Mg21]i caused a G-V shift of ÿ15.95 6 3.05 mV for E374D even after subtraction of the effect of the lowafﬁnity Mg21 site (Fig. 2 C). Among all mutations on E374 that we have studied, only E374D retains Mg21 sensitivity. Other E374 mutations abolish Mg21 sensitivity, similar to E374A (Fig. 2 C). Multiple comparison with Tukey’s test indicates that the result of E374D in Fig. 2 C is signiﬁcantly different from the result of the other mutants (. 95% conﬁdence level). These results demonstrate that a carboxylate, or negative charge, in the residue at position 374 is essential

Equation 2 is derived from a model of mSlo1 activation by Mg21 binding to the two different binding sites (63), where
Po is the open probability of the channel; L0 is the equilibrium constant between the closed and open states at the voltage of 0 mV when no Ca21 or Mg21 is bound (L0 ¼ [C0]/ [O0]); z is the number of equivalent gating charges; KcM1, KcM2, KoM1, and KoM2 are the dissociation constants of Mg21 binding to the high- and low-afﬁnity Mg21 sites on each sub-
unit when the channel is at closed and open states, respec-
tively; and V, T, F, and R have their usual meanings. Equation 2 does not include Ca21-dependent activation because [Ca21]i in these experiments is 0 (Fig. 4). We have demonstrated that the two Mg21 binding sites act indepen-
dently in channel activation, and mutations E399N and
E374A:E399N do not affect channel activation through the
low-afﬁnity binding site (63). Such independence is further
demonstrated in Fig. 4 B, which shows that for several other E399 mutations that also destroy Mg21 sensitivity related to
the high-afﬁnity site, the shift of G-V relations in response to an increase of [Mg21]i from 10 to 100 mM is similar to that of WT mSlo1. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the
low-afﬁnity binding site is not affected by E399D either, and
the parameters related to this binding site in Eq. 2 are the same
as in the WT mSlo1 (Table 1). Comparing the parameters of
model ﬁtting to the WT and E399D data (Table 1), we ﬁnd that Mg21 afﬁnity of the high-afﬁnity binding site is altered
by the mutation in both open and closed conformation (KoM1 and KcM1). The model used in the ﬁtting is derived from

the MWC model (39,64), in which Mg21 binds to the open channel with higher afﬁnity and shifts the closed-open equilibrium toward the open conformation by factor c (c ¼ KoM1/ KcM1) (64). Table 1 shows that in the open conformation, the afﬁnity of Mg21 binding may be unaffected by the mutation E399D (KoM1 similar), whereas in the closed conformation, the afﬁnity may even be increased (KcM1 smaller). Thus, the

mutant channel has a larger c factor than the WT mSlo1,
signifying that activation of the E399D channel is less sensitive to the effects of Mg21 binding (Figs. 3 C and 4 A).
We then examined the effects of Q397 mutations on the
activation of mSlo1 channels. Fig. 5 A shows the comparison of Mg21-dependent activation of the WT mSlo1 channels
with that of mutant channels Q397R, Q397K, Q397D,
Q397E, Q397C, and Q397W. Unlike mutations of E374 and E399, most of which abolish Mg21 sensitivity, none of the mutations of Q397 destroys Mg21 sensitivity entirely. Most
surprisingly, even when the residue is mutated to positively
charged side chains (Q397R and Q397K), the channel still

both the closed and the open conformations of the channel (KcM1 and KoM1), resulting in a smaller c factor (c ¼ KoM1/ KcM1) and an increased Mg21 sensitivity in the case of Q397E and in a larger c factor and a reduced Mg21
sensitivity in the case of Q397K and Q397C (Fig. 5 and
Table 1). The increase of Mg21 sensitivity by mutations Q397D and
Q397E suggests that a negative charge at position 397 may affect Mg21 binding by an electrostatic attraction to the bound Mg21 ion. If this is the case, a positive charge at this position is expected to reduce Mg21 sensitivity by electrical
repulsion. Our experiment results show that mutations Q397R and Q397K indeed reduced Mg21 sensitivity (Fig. 5, A and B). However, both Q397C and Q397W also reduced Mg21
sensitivity (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that a conformational
change caused by Q397 mutations may also be important to Mg21 binding. Therefore, it is not clear whether the effect of
Q397R and Q397K was caused by an electrostatic interac-
tion or a conformational change. To address this question, we
treated Q397C with the Cys-modifying reagent MTSET(1).
The covalent addition of a positively charged MTSET(1)
to Q397C had no apparent effect on the kinetics of channel gating (Fig. 6 A), but it reduced Mg21 sensitivity as compared to Q397C before MTSET(1) treatment (Fig. 6 B).
These experiments were performed on the double mutation
Q397C:C430A to eliminate the effect of MTSET(1)
modiﬁcation of the native C430 (65). C430A alone does

retains Mg21 sensitivity (Fig. 5 A). These results are not con-
sistent with the idea that the side chain of Q397 is the ligand for the Mg21 binding site. Nevertheless, the results in Fig. 5 A
suggest that because the side chain of Q397 is spatially close to E374 and E399, the mutations of Q397 may affect Mg21 binding if E374 and E399 are part of the Mg21 binding site, and thus the Mg21 sensitivity of channel activation. Mutations Q397R, Q397K, Q397C, and Q397W reduce Mg21
sensitivity of the channel signiﬁcantly (Fig. 5 A). On the
other hand, when Q397 is mutated to negatively charged side chains (Q397E and Q397D), Mg21 sensitivity is increased
(Fig. 5 A). We also measured the G-V relations of Q397C, Q397K, and Q397E mutant channels at various [Mg21]i levels between 0 and 100 mM at 0 [Ca21]i, and ﬁtted the data with Eq. 2 (Fig. 5, B–D). The parameters obtained from
model ﬁttings are listed in Table 1. Compared to the WT mSlo1 channels, these mutations altered Mg21 afﬁnity in

Tuning BK Channel Mg21 Sensitivity
not alter Mg21 sensitivity of the channel, and MTSET(1) treatment of C430A has no effect on Mg21 sensitivity either (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the effects of MTSET(1) on Q397C:C430A are speciﬁcally caused by the modiﬁcation of Q397C. Fig. 6 B shows that Q397C reduces Mg21 sensitivity in the background of C430A (10 mM Mg21 resulted in a shift of the G-V relation ÿ47.76 6 1.59 mV for Q397C: C430A channels as compared to ÿ70.28 6 1.68 mV for C430A), which is similar to its effect on the WT mSlo1 (Fig. 5 A). The modiﬁcation of Q397C by MTSET(1) further reduces Mg21 sensitivity, supporting the mechanism that electric charges at position 397 may affect Mg21 sensitivity by an electrostatic interaction with the bound Mg21 ion.
DISCUSSION
We examined the mechanism of Mg21-dependent activation of mSlo1 BK channels by studying the effects of mutating E374, E399, and Q397. We found that a carboxylate, or a negative charge, on the side chain of residues 374 and 399 is essential for Mg21 sensitivity (Figs. 2 and 3). On the other hand, no mutations of Q397 abolished Mg21 sensitivity, suggesting that the side chain of Q397 may not coordinate to Mg21 (Fig. 5). However, Q397 is spatially close to E374 and E399 (Fig. 1), so the effects of Q397 mutations may derive from their interference with Mg21 binding if E374 and E399 indeed form the binding site (Fig. 1). Effects of Q397 mutations and chemical modiﬁcation of Q397C suggest that the mutations affect Mg21 binding by altering the conformation of the binding site as well as by electrostatic interactions with the bound Mg21 ion (Figs. 5 and 6; Table 1).
Based on the homology between Slo1 channels and the K1 channels in E. coli or MthK, E374, E399, and Q397 are located on the surface of a Rossman fold (38,58,59). The relation of these residues is comparable to the organization of the Mg21 binding site in the response regulator of bacterial chemotaxis, CheY, which is also located on the surface of a Rossman fold, and the bound Mg21 ion is coordinated by the side-chain carboxylates of two Asp residues (D13 and D57), the backbone carbonyl of Asn-59, and three water molecules (66–68). In mSlo1, mutations of E374 and E399 even to amino acids with an oxygen-containing side chain abolish Mg21 sensitivity as long as the substituting residue is not an Asp (Figs. 2 and 3). Similarly, mutations D13N and D57N of the CheY’s Mg21 binding site reduce Mg21 afﬁnity by more than an order of magnitude (69). In addition, the Mg21 binding sites in mSlo1 or CheY do not discriminate between metals on the basis of their size. For example, the dissociation constants of Mg21 and Ca21 binding to mSlo1 at the open state are 2.2–6.0 mM and 0.66 mM, respectively (37,39,63), whereas the dissociation constants of Mg21 and Ca21 binding to CheY are 1.0 mM and 0.4 mM, respectively (70). Such a lack of size speciﬁcity is in striking contrast to the dissociation constants of Mg21 and Ca21 binding to the high-afﬁnity Ca21 binding site of mSlo1 at the open state,

2897
which are 4.73–5.6 mM and 0.75–1.3 mM, respectively (37,39,63,64,71). These properties of the Mg21 binding site
in CheY derive from its coordination scheme in which one
hemisphere of the bound ion is coordinated by three protein
oxygens, and the other hemisphere is coordinated by three
solvent molecules at the protein surface (70). On one hand, the
ﬂexible solvent shell can easily vary its coordination number
and shape to accommodate bound ions of different sizes; on
the other hand, the side-chain carboxylates are required to provide strong coordination (72). Because the Mg21 binding
site in mSlo1 shares the same properties as that in CheY,
it may also share a similar coordination scheme, i.e., the two
side-chain carboxylates from E374 and E399 and the mainchain carbonyl at Q397 provide oxygens for Mg21 coordi-
nation (38), whereas the side chain of Q397 may not be part of the ligands for the Mg21 binding site in mSlo1 (Fig. 5).
According to this coordination scheme, although mutations
E374D and E399D may cause conformational changes of the binding site, the channel retains Mg21 sensitivity because
the ﬂexible solvent shell may vary to accommodate such conformational changes to allow Mg21 binding.
Mg21 activates the BK channel by an allosteric mechanism (Fig. 1) (37–40,63); i.e., Mg21 binding induces a con-
formational change of the channel protein that eventually opens the activation gate distant from the Mg21 binding site. In CheY, Mg21 binding induces a conformational change
near the binding site (67,68,73). Conformational changes near
the binding site are also observed in many other proteins as a
result of metal binding (74–77). In mSlo1, Q397 is close to
E374 and E399 (Fig. 1). Because all mutations of Q397 in our study affect Mg21 sensitivity, this residue is likely involved in the Mg21-dependent activation mechanism such that the Mg21 binding induces conformational changes at and around Q397, and reciprocally, Mg21 binding is also al-
tered by the mutations of Q397.
However, it is hard for a simple conformational change to explain the results that Q397D and Q397E increase Mg21 sensitivity whereas other mutations reduce Mg21 sensitivity
(Fig. 5 A). When the chemical properties of the substituting
side chains of Q397 mutations are compared with their effects on Mg21 sensitivity, it is clear that the side-chain size (Van der Waals volume: W . R . E . K $ Q . D . C) or hydrophobicity (C . W . Q . K . E . D . R) (78) may not decide the effects of mutations on Mg21 sensitivity (E % D . Q . C . W % R % K) (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, it is apparent that both Q397E and Q397D contain a negative charge, and both increase Mg21 sensitivity. When Q397C is modiﬁed by MTSET(1), the covalently attached positive charge reduces Mg21 sensitivity, similar to the effects of mu-
tations Q397R and Q397K (Figs. 5 and 6). Thus, electro-
static interaction plays an important role in the effect of Q397
mutations. The charge introduced to the residue at 397 by mutations affects Mg21 binding by either electrical repulsion or attraction to the bound Mg21 ion. Consistent with this
mechanism, ﬁttings of the MWC model to G-V relations

at various [Mg21]i suggest that Q397K reduces Mg21 afﬁnity in both the closed and the open conformations of the channel (KcM1 and KoM1 become larger), whereas Q397E increases Mg21 afﬁnity (KcM1 and KoM1 become smaller) (Table 1). Such an electrostatic contribution to metal binding by charged surface residues has been reported previously and has been suggested as a common mechanism in metal-binding proteins (79–82). The electrostatic interaction between Q397 mutations and the Mg21 binding site suggests that Q397 is located close to the Mg21 binding site, further supporting that E374 and E399 are the ligands for the Mg21 binding site.
In conclusion, this study further demonstrates that E374 and E399 side chains are part of the Mg21 binding site. Mg21 sensitivity of channel activation can be tuned by altering Mg21 binding through changing the conformation of the binding site per se (E374D and E399D) or the environment of the binding site (Q397 mutations). However, the effect of Q397 mutations on Mg21-dependent activation requires a functional Mg21 binding site because a double mutation, E374A:Q397E, had no Mg21 sensitivity (data not shown). This result also demonstrates that although Q397 is close to the Mg21 binding site, within the range of electrostatic interactions, it cannot replace E374 in coordination of Mg21 binding.
