Abstract
Stunning advances have been achieved in addressing the protein folding problem, providing deeper
understanding of the mechanisms by which proteins navigate energy landscapes to reach their native
states and enabling powerful algorithms to connect sequence to structure. However, the realities of the
in vivo protein folding problem remain a challenge to reckon with. Here, we discuss the concept of the
“proteome folding problem”—the problem of how organisms build and maintain a functional
proteome—by admitting that folding energy landscapes are characterized by many misfolded states
and that cells must deploy a network of chaperones and degradation enzymes to minimize deleterious
impacts of these off-pathway species. The resulting proteostasis network is an inextricable part of
in vivo protein folding and must be understood in detail if we are to solve the proteome folding problem.
We discuss how the development of computational models for the proteostasis network’s actions and the
relationship to the biophysical properties of the proteome has begun to offer new insights and capabilities.

The Protein Folding Problem
In 1958, Kendrew et al . published the first three-
dimensional model of the structure of a globular
protein, sperm whale myoglobin. Although the
resolution was only 6  A, the complexity of the
structure was abundantly clear and led the authors
to remark: “The arrangement seems to be almost
totally lacking in the kind of regularities which one
instinctively anticipates, and it is more complicated
than has been predicted by any theory of protein
structure”.1 This complexity became even more
apparent in later, higher resolution structures of
myoglobin.2 In parallel with these studies, Anfinsen
and others were studying the process of protein fold-
ing using bovine pancreatic ribonuclease as a model
protein. They discovered that the complicated struc-
tures reported by Kendrew and others seemed to be
the thermodynamically most stable conformations
that could be adopted by polypeptide chains. More-
over, they showed that these structures could be
attained without assistance from any external bio-
logical machinery, despite their complexity.3–6
These two lines of work immediately suggested that
protein primary structures contain all the information
needed to produce the rich complexity evident in
protein tertiary structures. And so, the protein folding
problem was born.
The protein folding problem has dominated
protein science for the past 60 years. There are
many definitions of it, but we prefer Dill’s three-
part formulation7,8: (1) how do we predict a protein’s
three-dimensional tertiary structure from its one-
dimensional primary structure? (2) how do the vari-

ous intra- and intermolecular interactions in the sys-
tem (protein–protein, protein-solvent, and solvent–
solvent) determine this three-dimensional struc-
ture? and (3) what is (are) the pathway(s) by which
it is formed? Tremendous progress has been made
on all three aspects of the protein folding problem,
and this progress has been accelerating as more
powerful computational and experimental methods
have been brought to bear.9 This past year, how-
ever, we witnessed an extraordinary advance
toward a solution to the protein folding problem in
the performance of AlphaFold, an artificial intelli-
gence program developed by DeepMind to predict
protein structures. In CASP14 (the 14th running of
the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction
competition), AlphaFold was able to predict the
three-dimensional structures of an array of proteins
with a median accuracy that was as high as that of
models built from experimental data.10,11 The
potential utility of this algorithm was recently power-
fully demonstrated by predicting the structures of
almost every protein in the human proteome.12
While AlphaFold cannot be considered a compre-
hensive solution to the protein folding problem—it
addresses only the first of the three questions that
make up the protein folding problem as defined
above—we believe that it probably will mark a
new era in protein science. As such this seems like
a suitable moment to pause and consider what chal-
lenges might define the next 60 years of protein
science the way that the protein folding problem
has defined the last 60.
The Proteome Folding Problem
The protein folding problem focuses on one
outcome that can occur when an unstructured
protein is placed under native conditions: folding
to the functional native structure. However, it has
long been known that folding is not so
straightforward for many (if not most) proteins,
and that other, more untoward outcomes are
possible.13 Proteins can become trapped in mis-
folded conformations that represent local minima
on their folding energy landscapes.14,15 This is
especially true for longer proteins with more compli-
cated topologies, which are underrepresented
among proteins for which detailed in vitro folding
studies have been done.16 This situation can be
visualized with a folding energy landscape that
contains more than one deep minimum, as sug-
gested by Clark in 2004.15 Such a folding energy
landscape is depicted in Figure 1. If these misfolded
conformers are abundant enough and persist for
long enough, they can self-associate to form aggre-
gates that are virtually never salutary to a cell and
are usually toxic, especially in their early stages of
formation.17–20 Even if misfolded proteins did not
aggregate, it is very unlikely that they would be func-
tional, and such a loss-of-function could be devas-
tating.17,19,20 Moreover, many different proteins
are present simultaneously in vivo, a feature of the
proteome folding problem that introduces major
complexity. To mitigate the effects of protein mis-
folding, all organisms from the time of the last uni-
versal common ancestor have had a network of
cellular components that is tasked with maintaining
protein homeostasis, or “proteostasis”, which is the
condition of an organism having enough properly
folded proteins to carry out the functions essential
to life but not so much misfolded/aggregated protein
as to interfere with these functions.21,22
Recognizing that protein folding is not an ideal
process and that there is biological machinery that
exists to help it along raises a different problem
that has been gaining recognition over the past
two decades14–19,23,24 and that we believe will
become one of the dominant questions in protein
science going forward: the proteome folding prob-
lem . In our view, the proteome folding problem
can be broken into two questions. The first is still
intrinsic to protein sequences under a given set of
conditions: what alternative states are competitive
with the native state, either thermodynamically or
kinetically or both, on the protein folding energy
landscape as it exists in living cells? This question
subsumes the original protein folding problem, but
it also requires an understanding of the energetics
of non-native states, which would have been con-
sidered decoys or incorrect solutions in the context
of the original protein folding problem. In addition, it
includes issues relating to the environment within
cells. Many environmental variables that can pro-
foundly influence protein folding vary not only
between cells but also within cells—from organelle
to organelle and potentially even between liquid–liq-
uid phase separated domains in a single orga-
nelle.25–29 These variables include but are not
limited to: the pH; the concentrations of ions and
osmolytes30–32; and macromolecular crowding.33–35
The second question in the proteome folding
problem is largely extrinsic to protein sequences:
how do components of the biological folding
machinery, the “proteostasis network”, interact
with proteins to optimize protein folding outcomes,
or when folding fails, how do they mitigate the
impact of protein folding failures? We examine
these questions in the following sections.
Non-Native States of Proteins and the
Cellular Folding Environment
A useful example of the non-native states of
proteins comes from work by the Anfinsen lab on
ribonuclease folding.4,15 Ribonuclease has eight
cysteine residues that can form four disulfide bonds.
There are 105 possible pairings of these cysteines
as disulfides, only one of which allows native folding
and function. Re-folding reduced and denatured
ribonuclease under conditions that permit cysteine

oxidation to disulfides, but not subsequent disulfide
shuffling, produces a mixture in which many, or per-
haps even most, of the 104 mispaired combinations
of disulfides can be found; these all represent non-
native states.
Non-native states would not be a problem for
biological protein folding if they were transient.
They become a problem only when substantial
amounts of protein become trapped in non-native
states on time scales comparable to other
biological processes like protein synthesis, protein
trafficking, cell division, etc. In the case of
ribonuclease, even when refolding is performed in
a redox buffer so that disulfide interchange is
possible, non-native states with mispaired
disulfides form quickly but resolve relatively slowly
to the native state.3,4,36 As a result, a substantial
fraction of ribonuclease is non-native as it reac-
quires the native state over the course of more than
an hour. As Anfinsen observed at the time,37 this sit-
uation seems biologically untenable.
Ribonuclease becomes trapped in non-native
states because these states are kinetically
stabilized by the disulfide bonds between
mispaired cysteine residues. Such covalent
linkages, however, are not necessary to create
long-lived non-native states. The same forces that
stabilize protein native states can stabilize
misfolded states, perhaps not as efficiently since
misfolded states should not be as well-packed as
native states, but the energy barrier to “un-
misfold” a non-native state could cause a
substantial slowing of the overall rate of native
folding and lead to a persistent population of non-
native protein.15
Non-native states can also be stabilized by
aggregation. In this case, parts of a protein that
normally interact intramolecularly in the native
state end up on the surface of a non-native state
where they can drive self-association via
intermolecular interactions.15,18,38,39 The stability
of aggregates formed in this way is concentration
dependent. If the aggregation-prone non-native
state is below a “critical concentration”, then aggre-
gation will not occur. Above that concentration,
aggregation is possible.18,39,40 In addition, aggrega-
tion will be faster as the concentration increases fur-
ther.39,41 Native folding is likely to be rate limited by
the off-rate for protein molecules dissociating from
aggregates, which could be very slow indeed (Fig-
ure 1). Even worse, the aggregated state can over-
take the native state to become the
thermodynamically most stable state, especially if
the native state stability is compromised by an envi-
ronmental factor (temperature, pH, etc.) or muta-
tion, or if the protein is highly concentrated as
could occur if it was, for example, preferentially par-
titioned into a phase separated domain.25
Answering the first question of the proteome
folding problem—what alternative states compete
with the native state on the protein folding energy
landscape?—requires the ability to predict the
properties of non-native states in the cellular
environment (i.e., accounting for the pH, solute
composition, crowding, etc. inside the cell) from
sequence information. This is like the protein
Figure 1. Protein folding energy landscape with multiple minima, following the depiction by Clark.15 The blue areas
represent the unfolded state, while the three energy wells shown represent the native state and two non-native states
(a misfolded monomer and an aggregated state, as labeled). The aggregated state becomes more stable as the
protein concentration increases. Protein that enters the non-native states may have to cross significant energy
barriers to reach the native state, making these steps potentially rate-limiting for folding.

folding problem, but non-native states of proteins
are much more difficult to study than native states.
Non-native states are heterogeneous, and/or
amorphous, and/or insoluble; all these qualities
interfere with the usual techniques that are used
to study proteins. Nevertheless, substantial
inroads have been made in the experimental
characterization of non-native states, especially
the class of fibrillar, and often disease-associated,
protein aggregates known as amyloid.42 Detailed
structures of amyloid fibrils have now been obtained
by solid-state NMR,43,44 X-ray and electron diffrac-
tion of microcrystals,45,46 and cryo-electron micro-
scopy.47–48 Less structured non-native states have
been characterized as well (albeit at much lower
resolution) using, for example, single-molecule
methods,49–52 small-angle X-ray scattering,53,54
NMR,55,56 and other methods.57
Real progress in determining the sequence-
structure-energy relationships in the cellular milieu
will of course require much more experimental
data of the sort described in the preceding
paragraph, but in addition this data will have to be
wedded to computational methods so that the
underlying physics can be understood.
Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that algorithms
like AlphaFold, which rely primarily on structural
bioinformatics-based methods for native structure
prediction, will be useful for this endeavor. The
massive databases of non-native protein
structures that would be needed do not exist, and
probably cannot exist because so many non-
native states are heterogeneous and dynamic.
Computationally exploring non-native regions of
the protein folding energy landscape is likely to be
the province of computational molecular physics
methods.9 Such methods operate from first princi-
ples and therefore do not need auxiliary databases.
As these methods become faster and more reliable,
they will become better able to predict protein mis-
folding as well as protein folding and fill a central
role in solving the proteome folding problem.
The Proteostasis Network
If the proteome folding problem were just about
characterizing non-native states, it would simply
be an extension of the protein folding problem.
There would be nothing “proteomic” about such a
problem because the structures and energetics of
non-native states are still inherent in the primary
sequence and the cellular environment, complex
as it is. However, the non-native states of cellular
proteins must compete for attention from the
proteostasis network, and through this competition
their folding energy landscapes communicate with
each other. Misfolding by one protein means that
the proteostasis network has less bandwidth to
handle other proteins, which leads to the other
proteins misfolding as well; this effect has been
compellingly demonstrated in multiple systems.58–
61 Thus, protein misfolding to non-native states
and/or aggregates is truly a proteomic problem in
a way that native folding is not.
As we mentioned in the previous section,
Anfinsen recognized at the time of his original
work on ribonuclease folding that ribonuclease’s
unassisted folding rate was too slow to be
biologically reasonable. To address this, Anfinsen
and others searched for, and found, a catalyst for
ribonuclease folding in cell extracts: protein
disulfide isomerase (PDI).15,37,62–65 Although this
result did not get as much attention as the finding
that ribonuclease’s native state was its thermody-
namically most stable conformation, we believe it
was equally profound. It showed that, although
protein folding can spontaneously yield the native
state, it nevertheless requires biological interven-
tion to operate reliably enough in living, evolving
organisms with the inherent challenges of the
in vivo environment and the multitude of
simultaneous folding/unfolding/misfolding events.
After the discovery of PDI it still took decades
before there was a more-or-less complete
accounting of the types of components that make
up the proteostasis network. Now we recognize
that perhaps the most prominent components of
the proteostasis network are the chaperones,
including the Hsp70,66 Hsp6067 and Hsp90 sys-
tems,68 the small Hsps,69 and the Hsp100s70
(Hsp = heat shock protein). Also prominent are
the ATP-driven proteases that degrade non-native
proteins, including AAA + ATPases like Lon in
prokaryotes71 and larger systems like the ubiqui-
tin–proteasome system72 and the autophagy-
lysosome pathway73 in eukaryotes. Together, the
chaperones and the degradation machinery, along
with proto-chaperones like polyphosphate74; post-
translational modifications like glycosylation and
their associated machinery75; the effect of co-
translational folding76–79; folding enzymes like the
PDIs80 and the cis – trans peptidyl-prolyl iso-
merases81; and the signaling pathways that regu-
late the concentrations of all these components82–
84 act to promote folding, discourage misfolding,
disperse aggregates, or degrade non-native pro-
teins to recycle their constituent amino acids.
Answering the second question of the proteome
folding problem—how do proteostasis network
components optimize protein folding and mitigate
the consequences of folding failures?—requires a
comprehensive understanding of how proteostasis
network components act on their substrates. This
includes the kinetics, thermodynamics, and
sequence selectivity of substrate binding by
proteostasis network components. Some
sequence-based predictive algorithms for the
energetics of such interactions have already been
proposed for some of the more prominent
chaperones, like Hsp70.85–87 Fundamental under-

standing of chaperone action also requires an
understanding of how substrate conformations are
affected by being shuttled through the (frequently
ATP-driven) conformational cycles. These cycles
have been intensively studied for all the major
ATP-driven chaperones and much is known about
them; nevertheless, some issues remain unre-
solved. For example, for Hsp70 chaperones the
structural basis for their selective promiscuity of
substrate binding is a puzzle: they discriminate
incompletely folded proteins from folded but still
their clients represent a large fraction of the pro-
teome.88 How do Hsp70s alter the folding land-
scape of their substrates? The Hsp70 system
includes the Hsp70 itself plus two co-chaperones,
a nucleotide exchange factor and a so-called J-
domain protein that activates the Hsp70 ATPase
and often helps deliver clients.66 In addition, they
frequently hand off their substrates to downstream
chaperones such as Hsp90s.89,90 Details of these
processes are lacking. Lastly, while many proper-
ties and functions of Hsp70s are conserved across
cellular compartments, species, and kingdoms, the
generality of their allosteric properties and functions
remains unclear. Efforts to address these questions
are being accelerated by the availability of increas-
ingly powerful techniques based on, for example,
cryo-electron microscopy and NMR.
The Proteome Folding Problem Can
Only Be Solved with Systems Models
for In Vivo Protein Folding
The proteome folding problem is not simply the
next frontier in protein science. Failures of
proteostasis have been implicated in many human
diseases, including gain-of-toxicity (Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease, the transthyretin
amyloidoses, etc.) and loss-of-function diseases
(cystic fibrosis, Gaucher’s disease, Fabry’s
disease, etc.).17,19,20,91 Thus, understanding pro-
teostasis is important at both a fundamental and a
practical level. At a fundamental level, understand-
ing proteostasis informs us about the challenges
involved in maintaining the thousands to tens of
thousands of proteins in typical organismal pro-
teomes in a functional state, which is a clear pre-
requisite to understanding how organisms survive
and evolve in the face of environmental challenges.
At a practical level, many proposed therapies for pro-
tein misfolding diseases involve promoting folding or
inhibiting aggregation by improving protein folding
energetics (through kinetic stabilization or pharma-
cologic chaperoning of proteins with destabilizing
mutations)92–95 or by manipulating the proteostasis
network (through modulating the concentrations or
activities of proteostasis network compo-
nents).17,19,91,96–101 Both endeavors require a
systems-level appreciation of in vivo protein folding,
but how can such an appreciation be achieved?
None of the proteostasis network components
operates in isolation. Many of them bind to similar
features on unfolded and misfolded proteins (for
example, exposed hydrophobic residues) so they
likely compete for substrates.85–87,102–106 This com-
petition can be especially important when compo-
nents that favor folding (like chaperones) compete
with the degradation machinery. Different chaper-
ones can also collaborate with each other by binding
to substrates and acting on them sequen-
tially.89,90,107,108 We believe that the simultaneous
presence of the full array of proteostasis network
components and any emergent properties that arise
from their joint activities are too complex to be under-
stood by intuition alone. They can only be under-
stood by developing models that account for this
complexity,109–121 an example of which is
FoldEco,110 a model for proteostasis in E. coli
(Figure 2).
These models consist of systems of coupled
differential rate equations, one for each species in
the system, in which the variables are species
concentrations, and each term represents a
process in model. The coefficients of the terms in
the rate equations are the rate constants for the
corresponding process. Although analytical
solutions of simplified systems and steady states
are often illuminating, these sets of rate equations
are generally solved numerically.110,111 This pro-
cess requires that every parameter in the system
be given a numerical value, including the initial con-
centrations of each species and the rate constants
for every process, from the unimolecular conforma-
tional transitions involved in protein folding/misfold-
ing, to the bimolecular chaperone-substrate
recognition events, among many other processes
(Figure 2). Thus, the primary challenge with devel-
oping a model for in vivo protein folding is parame-
terizing it. We have argued that literature estimates
of these parameters based on in vitro experiments
are suitable for processes like associations
between chaperones and co-chaperones that do
not directly involve the substrate.110 The parame-
ters for processes that involve individual members
of the proteomes, however, should differ from pro-
tein to protein, in principle requiring thousands or
tens of thousands of parameters for the model.
A computational model of the sort described in the
preceding section that could accurately predict
these parameters may one day solve this
parameterization problem. In the meantime, we
are fortunate that near-proteome-wide estimates of
many biophysical properties have been made for
E. coli proteins using either experimental or
computational methods, including native state
stability,122,123 folding kinetics,124 and solubility/ag-
gregation125—which together define much of a
protein’s folding energy landscape—as well as
chaperone efficacy for the Hsp70 and Hsp60
systems.126 We recently used these estimates to
create a coarse-grained representation of the entire

proteome for use with a new version of FoldEco
called FoldEcoSlim.111 FoldEcoSlim is simpler than
FoldEco because it does not represent the internal
steps of chaperone cycles in as much detail as the
original, but more complicated in that it accounts
for the background proteome, the dynamic response
of chaperone concentrations to protein folding
stress, and cell growth.111
These models of proteome folding have already
proven valuable for understanding, rationalizing,
and/or predicting experimental results about
proteostasis. For example, they have been used
to analyze how organisms maintain (or fail to
maintain) their proteomes under heat119 or oxidative
stress,116 or as they age,117 or as their proteomes
evolve.111,112 In addition, we have been able to
use proteome folding models to understand the
behaviors of a variety of specific proteins. For
example, we used a very simple model to under-
stand the effects of ligand binding on dihydrofolate
Figure 2. The FoldEco Model for Protein Folding in E. coli . The five subsystems in FoldEco are as follows: protein
synthesis and folding (light red), the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system (light blue), the GroEL/GroES chaperone
