Title:          Recent Developments and Applications of the MMPBSA Method
Subject:        The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) approach has been widely applied as an efficient and reliable free energy simulation method to model molecular recognition, such as for protein-ligand binding interactions.
Keywords:       molecular recognition, binding affinity, free energy simulation, MMPBSA, continuum solvation model
