Abstract

Maintaining a healthy proteome is fundamental for organism survival 1 , 2 . Integral to this are Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones that together facilitate the folding, remodeling and maturation of Hsp90’s many “client” proteins 3 – 7 . The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a model client strictly dependent upon Hsp90/Hsp70 for activity 8 – 13 . Chaperoning GR involves a cycle of inactivation by Hsp70, formation of an inactive GR:Hsp90:Hsp70:Hop “loading” complex, conversion to an active GR:Hsp90:p23 “maturation” complex, and subsequent GR release 14 . Unfortunately, a molecular understanding of this intricate chaperone cycle is lacking for any client. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the GR loading complex, in which Hsp70 loads GR onto Hsp90, revealing the molecular basis of direct Hsp90/Hsp70 coordination. The structure reveals two Hsp70s—one delivering GR and the other scaffolding Hop. Unexpectedly, the Hop cochaperone interacts with all components of the complex including GR, poising Hsp90 for subsequent ATP hydrolysis. GR is partially unfolded and recognized via an extended binding pocket composed of Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hop, revealing the mechanism of GR loading and inactivation. Together with the GR maturation complex (Noddings et al., 2020), we present the first complete molecular mechanism of chaperone-dependent client remodeling, establishing general principles of client recognition, inhibition, transfer and activation.

* The Clinical Trials and Epidemiology subject categories are now closed to new submissions following the completion of bioRxiv's clinical research pilot project and launch of the dedicated health sciences server medRxiv (submit.medrxiv.org) . New papers that report results of Clinical Trials must now be submitted to medRxiv. Most new Epidemiology papers also should be submitted to medRxiv, but if a paper contains no health-related information, authors may choose to submit it to another bioRxiv subject category (e.g., Genetics or Microbiology).
