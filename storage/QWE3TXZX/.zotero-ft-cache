sorption results9 revealed that the iron surface was mostly covered by promoter oxides of AI, Ca, and K. Postreaction XPS results also revealed a C ( Is) XPS peak of weak to moderate intensity centered at 284.1-283.7 eV. This binding energy approaches those
(ca. 283.5 eV) reported for iron cat bide^.^^*'^
More convincing evidence for carbide formation was obtained from TPHT results collected after reaction studies like those displayed in Figure 1 in which methane was the only product. After reaction a t temperatures below 340 OC, only small amounts of reactive carbon could be distinguished with maximum methane desorption rates near 300 OC. However, for higher reaction temperatures, large amounts of methane were produced with a maximum rate just above 400 OC. Since XPS results revealed only small amounts of carbonaceous residue on top of the catalyst surface, this reactive carbon must be associated with carbiding of the catalyst. Consequently, it appears that the active carbon incorporation catalyst is carbided iron. This conclusion is well supported by bulk carbon to iron stoichiometries of 0.1-0.25 estimated from the TPHT peak areas which were adequate to represent 40-60'36 conversion to bulk carbides such as Fe,C or FeSC2. Moreover, preliminary results from studies using bona fide iron carbides have shown similar catalytic b e h a ~ i o r . ~

Dealing with solvent has been a perpetual problem for molecular modeling. While using explicit solvent molecules provides one solution to the problem, such calculations require a major com-
putational effort if converged energies are required. Here we describe a more practical alternative in which solvent is treated as a statistical continuum.' The treatment provides both energies and derivatives analytically and thus may be used in a molecular mechanics force field. As we will show, it gives small-molecule hydration energies of comparable accuracy to those obtained from contemporary free energy perturbation methods but at only a fraction of the computational expense.
Method. We consider solvation free energy (Gd) traditionally as consisting of a solvent-solvent cavity term (G,,,), a solutesolvent van der Waals term (GvdW), and a solute-solvent electrostatic polarization term (Gpl):

GsoI = Gcav + GvdW + Gpol

Noting that C, for the saturated hydrocarbons in water is linearly relatedZto solvent-accessiblesurface area (SA), we follow precedentiaYbby setting

Gcav + GvdW = XuDkSAk

(2)

where SAk is the total solvent-accessible surface area of atoms of type k and ut is an empirical atomic solvation arameter. As a preliminary value for (rk, we use +7.2 cal/(mol i 2 ) for all atom types to reproduce hydration energies of simple hydrocarbons using
our recently described analytical surface area calc~lation.~ For G , , the total electrostatic free energy (Gs, kcal/mol) of
a system of widely separated particles (separations r (A), charges q (electrons), radii a (A)) in a medium of dielectric constant e
is given (eq 3) by the sum of Coulomb's law in a dielectric (term 1) and the Born equation (term 2). Term 1 can be expanded algebraically (eq 4) to give Coulomb's law in vacuo and a new second term which accounts for the effect of the dielectric medium on the pairwise interactions of charged particles. The sum of terms 2 and 3 in eq 4 is equal to G , and has been termed the generalized Born (GB) e q ~ a t i o n . ~The similar form of terms 2 and 3 in eq

4 prompts us to combine them into a single expression (eq 5) where

we definef,, as a function of rij and ai which makes eq 5 mimic

the relevant equations of classical electrostatics. While we have

+ not defined fGB uniquely, one simple but effective expression is
fGB = (ri; aite-D)o,ws here aij= (apj)Oa.nsd D = ri;/(2aij)z.

Used in eq 5, this expression gives the Born equation for super-
imposed charges when ,.' = 0, the Onsager reaction field energy
+ within 10% for a dipole in a spherical cavity when rij < O.laij,
and the Born Coulomb dielectric polarization energy within
1% for two charged spheres when rij > 2.5~1,. It is superior to

( r i t+ eq 4, which overestimates the interaction of buried charges with

the dielectric, and toj& =

ai;)o,sw, hich underestimates

the corresponding interaction of proximate exposed charges.

We compute Born radii (ai)numerically for each charged atom

i in the solute. This is done by evaluating Gpol(if)or each such

atom with a continuum dielectric medium using a finite difference

method (see supplementary material) assuming that all other

atoms are neutral and displace the dielectric. Given Gpl(i),the

effective spherical Born radius is obtained by solving the Born

term of eq 3 ( n = 1) for ai. We take the dielectric to begin at

some fixed, solvent-dependent distance from the solute van der

Waals surface.s For water solvent and atomic radii taken from

the OPLS force field,6 we established this dielectric offset em-

pirically as -0.09 A. We calculate derivatives of eq 5 treating

ai as a constant which can be updated periodically along with the

nonbonded pairlist. In the absence of major conformational
- changes, the simplification of a constant a does not introduce large
errors becausefGB is I O times more sensitive to small changes

in rij than to the associated changes in aij.

Results. To test eq 5, we compared its values for ,G using t = 78.3 for a series of small-molecule solutes with those from free energy perturbation (FEP) calc~lations.~In the FEP calculations: the perturbations consisted of electrically charging and discharging the solutes in a bath of TIP4P water molecules. Except for hydrogen radii, the same nonbonded parameters (atomic charges and radii) were used in both the FEP and eq 5 calculations, and these were taken from the OPLS force field.6 The results are given in Table I. Taking the G, data for neutral molecules, we found a linear correlation (slope = 1.1, correlation
coefficient 9 = 0.98) between the results of FEP and eq 5.
Although FEP on NH4+and AcO- gives G@ more negative than does eq 5, the FEP values are also more negative than experimental G,, by 10-20 kcal/mol. Thus G I has similar values for small molecules whether calculated by &P using an explicit, molecular solvent or by our continuum model.
In Table 1 we also compare total solvation energies (Gd)found by experiment with those from eqs 2 and 5. Here too the correlation is linear (slope = 0.96, r2 = 0.96). The correlation is
- illustrated in Figure 1, which plots the neutral molecule G,, data
from Table I . Even for ions, the model performs well and gives aqueous I M NH,OAc as dissociated in spite of the 130 kcal/mol attraction between the ions in vacuo. G,, is sensitive to the partial charges used. For example, only a 10% reduction
in the OPLS charges of MeSH was required to lower ,G by -0.9 kcal/mol and bring G,, to within 1.2 kcal/mol of experiment.
Thus solvation free energies are calculated reliably only when accurate atomic partial charges are used.

Figure 1. Comparison of experimental free energies of solvation in water

(kcal/mol) for neutral small molecules with GB/SA energies calculated

by using eqs 2 and 5 .

Given that the GB/SA solvation treatment described here requires adding only two new parameters ( u in eq 2 and the dielectric offset used to compute 01 in eq 5) to those in an existing
force field, the correlation between our results and experiments or molecular solvent calculations is remarkable. Using analytical derivatives of eqs 2 and 5, we are able to carry out converged molecular mechanics or dynamics with only 2-4-fold reduction in speed over corresponding in vacuo calculations. In comparison with a single FEP calculation of AGd which requires several weeks of MicroVAX 3200 computer time, all 49 of the GB/SA calculations reported here were carried out within a total of 1 cpu min. The solvation treatment described should provide a major advance

Surface Concentrations and Residence Times of Intermediates on Sm203during the Oxidative Coupling of Methane

The use of Sm203as a catalyst for the oxidative coupling of methane has been well studied and documented.'" However, detailed information on the surface of a working Sm203catalyst and the overall carbon reaction pathway is unknown. This communication presents results that delineate completely for the first time the nature of the surface-reaction steps of Sm2O3 and quantifies the working surface under steady-state reaction conditions.
The feasibility of using isotope switching experiments to study oxidative methane coupling has recently been shown.4" Some of the conclusions drawn from these experiments include the participation of the lattice oxygen in the reaction along with significant surface holdup of the methane and COXproducts. However, it is difficult to obtain quantitative results from the majority of this work5s6due to the pulsing technique employed.'
The technique used in this study involved switching the isotopic composition of methane from I2CH4to "CH, once the reaction had reached a steady state and subsequently following (by mass spectrometry) the evolution and decay of the different labeled reactants and products to their new steady-state values. Use of such a technique allowed the determination of surface coverages and intrinsic site activities as well as reaction pathways4
The Sm203(BET surface area = 1 m2/g) was purchased from Alfa Products. Prior to reaction, it was pretreated by heating to reaction temperature in flowing oxygen and then holding at reaction temperature for 30 min prior to introduction of the reactants. The reaction conditions used in this work were as follows: catalyst weight = I00 mg; temperature = 600 OC; total pressure = 1 atm; CHI flow = 5 cm3/min; He/CH4/02 = 94/10/1. These conditions resulted in a CH4conversion of 9.1%, a C 0 2 / C 0 ratio of 1.4, and a C2 selectivity of 25.7%. A straight-tube quartz reactor was used with an inlet i.d. of 4 mm which tapered to 1 mm after the catalyst bed. The catalyst bed was held in place by quartz wool, and in the absence of any catalyst the quartz reactor and quartz wool had negligible activity.
Figure 1 presents the transients obtained when the isotopic composition of methane is switched as described above. A trace amount of argon was present in one of the methane isotopes, which permitted correction for gas-phase holdup. The rapid relaxation

'Data collection for Table I permitted the collection of only five or six data points per transient response, yielding the relatively large potential error of f 0 . 7 s.

of the methane signal indicates the lack of a long-lived adsorbed methane. This result is consistent with a similar observation made with the Li/MgO system4 and in direct contrast with the results of Ekstrom and Lapszewicz.ss6 This difference appears to be due to diffusion effects in the higher surface area and higher porosity Sm203which was used by Ekstrom and Lapszewicz.* When using high-porosity catalysts, we observed isotopic transients with significant tailing, similar to those reported by Ekstrom and Lapszewicz.
The fact that the COStransient trails the C O transient may suggest a possible multistep surface oxidation pathway. However, the possibility that C 0 2is formed as a primary product and not from further oxidation of adsorbed C O cannot be completely ruled out from this data. The lack of strongly adsorbed C 0 2is evident from the rapid relaxation of the C 0 2transient. This observation has been confirmed by a series of experiments in which the catalyst bed length was varied, resulting in no change (within experimental error) in the C 0 2residence time, indicating that readsorption of COz was not important (see Table I ) . Although the surface residence times presented in Table I are subject to a relatively large error of approximately 0.7 s, they clearly show the lack of any relationship between catalyst bed length and surface residence time. Hence, no significant readsorption of any of the product molecules is indicated. By contrast, a similar set of measurements for C 0 2over a Li/MgO catalyst, which is known to form carbonates easily, indicated a 2-fold increase in residence time for C 0 2 with a 2-fold increase in the amount of ~ a t a l y s t . ~
These results are consistent with reports indicating that Sm,(CO,), is stable up to only 600 OC in an atmosphere void of C 0 2 and to 850 OC in 500 Torr of C02.'0 Under the conditions employed in this study, only 2.8 Torr of C 0 2 was present. Therefore, surface carbonates would not be expected to be very stable or present in any large amounts under the reaction conditions used for this study.
