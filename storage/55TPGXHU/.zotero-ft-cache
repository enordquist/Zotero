Mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mt-hsp70) functions as a molecular chaperone in mitochondrial biogenesis. The chaperone in co-operation with its co-proteins acts as a translocation motor pulling the mitochondrial precursor into the matrix. Mt-hsp70s are highly conserved when compared to the bacterial hsp70 homologue, DnaK. Here we have used DnaK as a model to study the interaction of mitochondrial presequences with mt-hsp70 applying a DnaK-binding algorithm, computer modeling and biochemical investigations. DnaK-binding motifs have been analysed on all available, statistically relevant mitochondrial presequences found in the OWL database by running the algorithm. A total of 87 % of mammalian, 97 % of plant, 71 % of yeast and 100 % of Neurospora crassa presequences had at least one DnaK binding site. Based on the prediction, ®ve 13-mer presequence peptides have been synthesized and their inhibitory effect on the molecular chaperone (DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE) assisted refolding of luciferase has been analysed. The peptide with the highest predicted binding likelihood showed the strongest inhibitory effect, whereas the peptide with no predicted binding capacity showed no inhibitory effect. A 3D structure of the pea mt-hsp70 has been constructed using homology modeling. The binding af®nities of the 13-mer presequence peptides and additional control peptides to DnaK and pea mt-hsp70 have been theoretically estimated by calculating the buried hydrophobic surface area of the peptides docked to DnaK and to the mt-hsp70 structural model. These results suggest that mitochondrial presequences interact with the mt-hsp70 during or after mitochondrial protein import.

Introduction
Heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) functions as a molecular chaperone in a variety of biochemical processes including the prevention of aggregation of newly synthesized or unfolded polypeptides, facilitation of translocation of nascent chains across membranes, mediating the assembly or disassembly of multimeric protein complexes, and targeting proteins to lysosomes or proteasomes for degradation (Hartl, 1996; Rassow et al., 1997). In yeast mitochondria, hsp70 in co-operation with mdj1 and Yge1p (homologues of bacterial DnaK and its

co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE, respectively) acts as an ATP-driven translocation-motor and pulls the emerging precursor into the mitochondrion (Glick, 1995; Horst et al., 1996). Hsp70 is also involved in the folding and assembly of imported mitochondrial proteins. It is of great interest to investigate the interaction of mitochondrial precursors with mitochondrial hsp70 (mt-hsp70).
Some information on the interaction of hsp70 with mitochondrial preproteins is available. Yeast cytosolic hsp70 (Ssa1p) can bind to synthetic peptides with amino acid compositions typical of mitochondrial presequences (Endo et al., 1996). The precursor of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase overexpressed in Escherichia coli has been shown to be complexed with DnaK via the presequence (Schmid et al., 1992).

Interaction of Mitochondrial Presequences with hsp70

aminotransferase to DnaK has been extensively studied (Pierpaoli et al., 1997; Schmid et al., 1994). In a cell-free transcription-translation system, hsp70 binds to the newly synthesized mitochondrial precursor of aspartate aminotransferase (Lain et al., 1994, 1995) and both the presequence and the N-terminal region of the mature part of the precursor are responsible for the binding (Lain et al., 1995). Due to the dif®culties in obtaining biochemical quantities of puri®ed mitochondrial hsp70, most of the knowledge about the interaction of the hsp70 chaperone with its substrate has come from the studies on the bacterial hsp70 homologue, DnaK, cytosolic hsp70, or the endoplasmic reticulum hsp70, BiP. Previous studies have shown that DnaK, Hsc70 and BiP preferentially interact with hydrophobic amino acids (Ile, Leu, Val, Ala, Phe, Trp and Tyr) and positively charged amino acids (Arg and Lys) but not with acidic residues (de Crouy-Chanel et al., 1996; Fourie et al., 1994; Gething et al., 1995; Hightower et al., 1994; Richarme & Kohiyama, 1993). The minimal length of sequence which can bind to these chaperones should be seven amino acid residues long (Fourie et al., 1994; Gething et al., 1995). BiP has the speci®c binding motif Hy(W/X)-HyXHyXHy (BlondElguindi et al., 1993), where Hy is a large hydrophobic or aromatic amino acid (most frequently

Trp, Leu, or Phe), and X is any amino acid. In the most recent study, the DnaK binding motif was identi®ed to be     HyHyHyHyHy     (RuÈ diger et al., 1997). The ®ve-residue hydrophobic core is enriched particularly in L, but also in I, V, F and T. The two four-residue ¯anking regions are enriched in basic resides. Acid residues are excluded from the core and disfavoured in ¯anking regions.
The hsp70 family is a class of highly conserved proteins. All of these proteins show a high degree of identity with DnaK (58-60 %). Hsp70 proteins contain two functional domains, an N-terminal ATP-binding domain ($44 kDa) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain ($27 kDa). The ATPbinding domain is highly conserved (>60 %). The substrate-binding domain displays less identity than the ATP-binding domain ($45 %; Hartl, 1996). According to structural information on DnaK (Zhu et al., 1996), the substrate binding domain of DnaK contains two structurally separated subdomains. The N-terminal subdomain is folded into a compact b-sandwich, and the C-terminal subdomain is composed of ®ve extended a-helices. The N-terminal b subdomain is responsible for substrate binding. Alignment of the substrate binding domain of four higher plant mitochondrial hsp70 proteins and DnaK shows that the b-sheet region has about

68 % identity, whereas the different a-helices only have about 21 % identity (cf. Figure 1).
Here, we have modeled mt-hsp70 based on the DnaK structure and we have searched for DnaK binding sites on a collection of 147 mitochondrial presequences from plants, mammals, yeast and Neurospora crassa using the algorithm of RuÈ diger et al. (1997). Based on the prediction results, ®ve presequence peptides have been synthesized and the activity of these peptides as inhibitors of DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE assisted refolding of luciferase has been analysed. The binding speci®city of these peptides to the mt-hsp70 model and to DnaK was analysed by calculating the buried hydrophobic surface area for the synthesized peptides docked to mt-hsp70 or DnaK. The calculated buried hydrophobic surface area on mt-hsp70 agreed well with the area on DnaK. Furthermore, the binding area correlated well with the experimentally determined af®nity of the peptides to DnaK, indicating that the binding speci®city of mt-hsp70 and DnaK are similar.
Results
Sequence conservation in the mt-hsp70 substrate-binding domain
In order to investigate the features of the substrate-binding domain of mt-hsp70, we aligned the four available plant mt-hsp70 sequences with the sequence of DnaK. The identity of these mt-hsp70s when compared to DnaK was 58-60 %. Based on the primary alignment, we identi®ed a region from the mt-hsp70s (residues 381-599 from kidney bean, spinach and pea, residues 381-600 from potato) which corresponded to the substrate-binding domain of DnaK (residues 389-607; Figure 1). In the N-terminal subdomain of the substrate-binding domain of DnaK (Zhu et al., 1996), two sheets with four antiparallel b-strands in each form a b-sandwich structure which serves as a substrate-binding cleft. The C-terminal subdomain comprises ®ve ahelices which appear to serve as a lid on the substrate cleft. Thirteen amino acid residues in the bsandwich subdomain interact with a peptide NRLLLTG through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces (Figure 1). In mt-hsp70, nine of the 13 residues are highly conserved (marked with shading), the remaining four are not conserved (marked shading in frames). Met404 in the loop between b1 and b2, Ala435 and Thr437 within b4 of DnaK are changed to Leu396, Gln427 and Gly429, respectively, in all mt-hsp70s. Val407 in b2 of DnaK is sometimes changed to Ile399.
Structural modeling of mt-hsp70 substratebinding domain
Based on the alignment and 3D structure of DnaK, a pea mt-hsp70 structural model was established using homology modeling (Figure 2). Comparison of the structure of the entire substrate-

binding domain between DnaK and the pea mthsp70 model, shown in Figure 2(a), reveals a high degree of similarity. Also the location of the peptide NRLLLTG crystallized together with DnaK is similar to that seen when the peptide is docked to the model mt-hsp70. All the amino acid residues that interact with the substrate peptide NRLLLTG through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces are shown in Figure 2(b). There are seven hydrogen bonds (broken yellow lines) formed between the substrate peptide and ®ve amino acid residues of DnaK (yellow script), Met404, Ser427, Ala429, Gln433 and Thr437. In the mt-hsp70, there are six hydrogen bonds (Table 1) formed between the peptide and amino acid residues corresponding to the above listed residues of the DnaK, Leu396, Ser419, Ala421, Gln425 and Gly429 (Figure 2(b), green script). Four hydrogen bonds are shown in Figure 2(b) (broken green lines). Two of the ®ve residues forming hydrogen bonds are different between the DnaK and the mt-hsp70 model. Substitution of Met404 by Leu396 does not in¯uence the formation of the hydrogen bond, but replacing Thr437 with Gly429 causes the loss of the hydrogen bond which existed between the Og of Thr437 and the peptide. Hydrogen bond lengths in DnaK and mt-hsp70 are comparable and are within the theoretical permissive length range (Table 1).
We investigated the surface charges of the substrate-binding b-subdomain of DnaK and mt-hsp70. Charges on the surface facing the N-terminal part of the NRLLLTG peptide were very similar between DnaK and mt-hsp70 (not shown), whereas the charges on the surface facing the C-terminal part of the peptide in DnaK and mt-hsp70, shown in Figure 2(c) and (d), respectively, showed some differences. In both structures, two negative charges located close to the substratebinding cleft are conserved (Glu402, Asp431 in DnaK, the corresponding residues are Glu394 and Asp423 in mt-hsp70; see Figures 1 and 2). However, the charge of Asp423 in mt-hsp70 has moved to the outside of the cleft due to a slight variation of side-chain orientation, it is invisible in Figure 2(d). In DnaK, the third negative charge, Asp460, is distantly located from the substratebinding cleft. The corresponding negative charge is missing in mt-hsp70. Two extra negative charges in mt-hsp70, Glu448 and Asp450 corresponding to Gln456 and Asn458 of DnaK, are located in close proximity to the substrate-binding cleft. These two negative charges are conserved in all known plant mt-hsp70s (Asp450 is substituted by Glu450 in spinach mt-hsp70 which maintains the charge; see Figure 1 residues in frame). Together with Glu394, these three negative charges form a strong negatively charged region just outside the substratebinding cleft of mt-hsp70 on the C-terminal side of the peptide. This region of negative charges would provide an appropriate surface for interacting with the positively charged amphiphilic a-helix of mitochondrial presequences.

Amino acid residues of DnaK are indicated in yellow script and those of mt-hsp70 are in green script. In order to get a good view, hydrogen atoms are hidden. See Table 4 for further information. Surface charges of the substrate-binding pockets of DnaK and mt-hsp70 are shown in (c) and (d), respectively. Asp423 and Glu394 in mt-hsp70 correspond to the Asp431 and Glu402 in DnaK, which are conserved in DnaK and all known plant mt-hsp70. Glu448 and Asp450 in mt-hsp70 are two negative charges which are conserved in all known plant mt-hsp70 (Asp450 is substituted by Glu450 in spinach mt-hsp70 which maintains the charge).

DnaK binding sites on mitochondrial presequences
Overlapping 13-mer peptides of presequences were scored according to the DnaK-binding algorithm (RuÈ diger et al., 1997). We analysed every 13mer peptide from a collection of 147 mitochondrial

presequences (Schneider et al., 1998) from plants, mammals, yeast and N. crassa. Our results showed that 87 % of mammalian, 97 % of plant, 71 % of yeast and 100 % of N. crassa, presequences have at least one DnaK binding site. Figure 3 shows the predicted results of 32 full-length plant mitochondrial presequences. Some presequences have sev-

long (85 residues). In Table 2, we show the binding motifs with the lowest score in each presequence from yeast, N. crassa and mammals.

Inhibition of DnaK-assisted refolding of the denatured luciferase by presequence peptides
Five peptides from plant mitochondrial presequences were synthesized according to the predicted DnaK binding motif (Table 3). The peptides 1-4 are binders and peptide 5 is a non-binder of DnaK according to the DnaK-binding algorithm (RuÈ diger et al., 1997). In competition experiments, the peptides were tested individually in the luciferase-refolding buffer before and during incubation of the unfolded luciferase with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE. Peptides 1-4 inhibited the chaperone-assisted luciferase refolding process. Peptide 2, which has the highest predicted binding likelihood, showed the strongest inhibitory effect (>90 % at 50 mM), peptides 1, 3 and 4 with the intermediate predicted binding likelihood showed an intermediate inhibitory ef®ciency, whereas peptide 5 with no predicted binding capacity showed no inhibitory effect even at 100 mM (Figure 4(a)). Also, measurements of refolding after different incubation times con®rmed the above conclusion (Figure 4(b)).
Binding capacity of presequence peptides to pea mt-hsp70
In order to show the af®nity of the synthesized presequence peptides with mt-hsp70, we modeled

heptapeptides derived from the synthesized peptides using ICM (Abagyan et al., 1994). These short peptides were docked to the mt-hsp70 model and to DnaK by computer simulation. The buried hydrophobic surface area was calculated (Table 4). We also calculated the buried hydrophobic surface area for three heptapeptides for which the binding af®nity to DnaK has been investigated with direct binding methods (Gragerov et al., 1994). Two of these peptides, LRRASLG and LLTNRGL which did not bind to DnaK, showed very low values of the buried hydrophobic binding areas within DnaK. The peptide NRLLLTG, which was shown to bind to DnaK with a high degree of af®nity, showed a high value of the buried hydrophobic surface area within DnaK. The ®ve synthesized peptides shown in Table 3 were studied in DnaK/ DnaJ/GrpE chaperone assisted luciferase-refolding experiments (cf. Figure 4). Peptide 5 with no inhibitory effect upon luciferase refolding experiments had a small buried hydrophobic surface area within DnaK, but peptides 2-4, which showed an inhibitory activity on refolding of luciferase, showed a large buried hydrophobic surface area value. A similar pattern of results was obtained with mt-hsp70. A greater binding area indicated a stronger interaction of the peptide with the mthsp70. These data indicate that the synthetic presequence peptides 1-4 have the potential to bind to

mt-hsp70 and that the binding af®nity of the peptides for both DnaK and mt-hsp70 seems to be very similar. Taken together, the presented ®ndings imply that mitochondrial presequences could interact with mt-hsp70 during mitochondrial protein import.
Discussion
Mt-hsp70 has a predominant role in the mitochondrial protein import. Two models have been proposed for its function in the translocation process, the molecular ratchet model and the translocation motor model (Neupert, 1997; Pfanner & Meijer, 1995; Schatz & Dobberstein, 1996). Mt-hsp70 is proposed to bind to segments of the polypeptide as these emerge on the inner side of

the inner membrane within the transport channel, with a net result of pulling precursors into mitochondria. Mitochondrial presequences contain information for targeting and processing. The mean length of known presequences from all organisms is 34 (Æ16) amino acid residues (Schneider et al., 1998). Considering the measured oscillation of the translocating protein with segments of about 40 residues (Ungermann et al., 1994), the presequence would be a primary target for mt-hsp70 on the condition that it contains consensus sequence for the mt-hsp70 binding. Presequences are rich in positively charged, hydrophobic and hydroxylated amino acids but have a very low content of negatively charged residues. The membrane potential required for the translocation of the presequence across mito-

chondrial membranes is negative inside the mitochondrion supporting the pull-in force of the positively charged presequence. If mt-hsp70 pulls precursors into mitochondria as suggested (Pfanner et al., 1997), it most likely has to interact ®rst with mitochondrial presequences.
DnaK is an obvious model system for investigating the interaction of mitochondrial prese-

quences with mt-hsp70 as this bacterial chaperone is very highly conserved in comparison to mt-hsp70s and its binding speci®city has been well characterized (RuÈ diger et al., 1997; Zhe et al., 1996). The mitochondrion is believed to have evolved from bacteria following endosymbiosis (Margulis, 1975).

Interaction of Mitochondrial Presequences with hsp70

Figure 4. Inhibition of DnaK-assisted refolding of unfolded ®re¯y luciferase by synthetic plant mitochondrial presequence peptides. (a) Molecular chaperones DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE were preincubated with various concentrations of the synthetic peptides, as indicated in the Figure, at room temperature for ten minutes. The denatured luciferase and ATP were then added, thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. Luciferase activity was detected with a luminometer as described in Materials and Methods. 100 % represents the chaperone-assisted luciferase refolding in the absence of any peptide. (b) Time course of the inhibition of DnaK-assisted refolding of unfolded ®re¯y luciferase by synthetic plant mitochondrial presequence peptides. The concentration of peptides was 10 mM. After adding luciferase, samples were withdrawn at various incubation times, and luciferase activity was analysed.
strate-binding domain. The former binds and hydrolyses ATP; this process supplies energy for the action of hsp70. The ATP-binding domain is highly conserved amongst all hsp70s, whereas the substrate-binding domain is less conserved (Hartl, 1996). However, structural analysis of the substrate-binding domain showed that the b-subdomain, which is responsible for peptide binding, is very highly conserved as are the

amino acid residues which directly contact a substrate peptide through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces (Figure 1). In pea mt-hsp70, in the b-subdomain of the substratebinding domain, out of 13 residues involved in the interaction with the substrate peptide only four residues are not conserved in comparison to DnaK. The alterations of Met404 and Val407 in DnaK to Leu396 and Ile399 in pea mt-hsp70, respectively, only slightly affected the hydrophobicity of the substrate-binding cleft. These residues of the chaperones interact with residues at the (À1, 1) and (À2) positions of the NRLLLTG substrate peptide. The third change of DnaK Ala429 to mt-hsp70 Gln425, conserved in all mt-hsp70s, makes the substrate-binding cleft more polar (cf. Figures 1 and 2). This increased polarity may be crucial for mt-hsp70 and it may ensure a higher binding af®nity between highly hydrophobic and positively charged presequences and mt-hsp70. Changing Thr437 in DnaK to Gly429, which has a smaller sidechain, in the mt-hsp70 removes one of the hydrogen bonds present in the interaction of DnaK with the peptide. This change allows the substrate-binding cleft to accept a peptide with larger side-chain amino residues. The similarity of the interaction of DnaK and mt-hsp70 with the substrate peptide is, however, best evidenced by the agreement of the calculated hydrogen bond lengths formed to the substrate (cf. Table 1). Despite four out of 13 residues not being conserved, the hydrogen bonding pattern between the substrate peptide and the mt-hsp70 was very similar to the pattern between the peptide and DnaK. Furthermore, analysis of surface charges on the b-subdomain of the substrate binding domain of mt-hsp70 revealed an area of high negative charge on one side of the substrate binding cleft (Figure 2(d)). This was due to the grouping of the three negatively charged residues, conserved in all known plant mt-hsp70s, resulting in a potential site of interaction with the positively charged amphiphilic a-helix of mitochondrial presequences. This may re¯ect a more speci®c presequence binding function of plant mt-hsp70s in comparison to DnaK.
A few reports have been presented of a direct interaction between the hsp70 family of proteins and individual mitochondrial presequences but none on the interaction of the mt-hsp70 with the presequences. The presequence of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase has been shown to bind to DnaK (Pierpaoli et al., 1997; Schmid et al., 1992) and to hsp70 in a cell-free transcriptiontranslation system (Lain et al., 1994, 1995). Cytosolic hsp70 (Ssa1p) can bind to synthetic peptides with amino acid compositions which form an amphiphilic a-helix, typical of mitochondrial presequences (Endo et al., 1996). In vitro import experiments using folded proteins containing a longer presequence suggest indirectly that

À, Peptides with low af®nity to DnaK. , Peptides with high af®nity to DnaK. a Af®nity of peptides to DnaK deduced from luciferase refolding experiment. b Peptide af®nity to DnaK came from biochemical studies (Gragerov et al., 1994; Zhu et al., 1996).

mt-hsp70 can interact with presequences (Matouschek et al., 1997).
In our study, we have analysed all available, statistically relevant mitochondrial presequences from mammals, plants, N. crassa and yeast. By using computer algorithms for the prediction of DnaK-binding sites (RuÈ diger et al., 1997). We found a potential DnaK-binding motif in almost all mitochondrial presequences (cf. Table 1, Figure 3). Most of the DnaK binding motifs are located at the N-terminal region or in the middle of the presequence. On the basis of these results, we chemically synthesised four peptides corresponding to the predicted strong DnaK-binding motifs and one peptide with no likelihood of binding. We have simulated docking of the peptides to the substratebinding cleft of both chaperones and have calculated the buried hydrophobic surface binding area for interaction of these peptides with the chaperones (cf. Table 4). The data obtained showed a good correlation between the predicted likelihood of binding and a value of the buried hydrophobic surface binding area for the peptides that were synthesized on the basis of the prediction. This correlation was also seen for the three control peptides for which binding af®nity to DnaK has been determined from direct biochemical binding studies. Also the effect of the synthetic presequence peptides on DnaK-assisted luciferase refolding con®rmed the prediction. The peptide with no likelihood of DnaK-binding had no inhibitory effect upon luciferase refolding and had a low calculated buried hydrophobic surface area within both chaperones, whereas the peptide with the highest predicted likelihood of DnaK-binding, showed a high degree of inhibitory activity on refolding of luciferase and a high buried hydrophobic surface area value.
In summary, we have shown that mt-hsp70 is very similar to DnaK in terms of both structure and the predicted substrate binding speci®city. Therefore, we suggest that DnaK is a suitable model system for studying interaction between the mitochondrial presequences and mt-hsp70. We have further shown that DnaK can bind mitochondrial presequences and on the basis of the modeling data we have extrapolated these

results to the mt-hsp70. The fact that the predicted DnaK-binding motifs are present in almost all mitochondrial presequences of all phylogenetic groups strongly supports the idea that mt-hsp70 binds the presequence of the incoming mitochondrial precursors to the matrix. The fact that DnaK-binding motifs were found in such a broad range of presequences suggests that the interaction of the mitochondrial presequences with mt-hsp70 might be a general phenomenon with consequences for the mechanism for mitochondrial protein import.
Material and Methods
Chemicals
ATP, puri®ed ®re¯y luciferase was purchased from Sigma; luciferase assay reagent from Promega; DTT from Scienti®c Imaging Systems, NY, USA.
Molecular chaperones DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE
The overexpressed DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE were kindly provided by Dr Hans-Joachim SchoÈ nfeld (SchoÈ nfeld et al., 1995).
Mitochondrial presequences
Mitochondrial presequence structures were collected from on-line OWL database (Schneider et al., 1998). Only the presequences with cleavage sites determined by N-terminal sequencing were used. These presequences are statistically relevant. The numbers of presequences collected were: plants, 32; mammals, 61; yeast, 39; and Neurospora crassa, 15.
Synthesis of presequence peptides
Five peptides (Table 3) corresponding to four plant mitochondrial presequences, pF1b from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, a-MPP(2) and b-MPP(1) from potato, and alternative oxidase (2) from soybean were synthesized by Boc/benzyl solid phase synthetic methods (Merri®eld, 1986) on p-methylbenzhydrylamine resin, to provide the C-terminal carboxamides after HF deprotection and cleavage. The synthetic products were puri®ed to homogeneity by reverse-phase chromatography and

gave amino acid analyses and MALDI-TOF mass spectra consistent with the expected structures.
hsp70 sequences and alignment
Sequences of DnaK, and mt-hsp70s from pea, potato and kidney bean were obtained from Swissprot and spinach mt-hsp70 was obtained from Genebank. Alignment was performed using Clustal W (1.7) (Thompson et al., 1994) using default parameters.
Establishment of the structural model of pea mt-hsp70
The structure of the substrate-binding domain of DnaK was downloaded from PDB (1DKX, Brookhaven National Laboratory) which was elucidated by Zhu et al. (1996), comprising residues 389 to 607 of DnaK. Through alignment of pea mt-hsp70 precursor with DnaK, we picked out the region from 381 to 599 of mature protein for kidney bean (HS7M PHAVU), spinach (AF039084, Genebank access number) and pea (HS7M PEA), and the region from 381 to 600 for potato (HS7M SOLTU) mature protein which correspond to the DnaK substratebinding domain. The model of the substrate binding domain of pea mt-hsp70 was created using the standard method for homology modeling in ICM (Cardozo et al., 1995). The complete model and the substrate-binding pocket together with a binding peptide (NRLLLTG) are shown in Figure 2.
The quality of the model was checked with WHATIF (Vriend, 1990), Errat (Colovos & Yeates, 1993), the verify3D server (Luthy et al., 1992) and PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). The quality of the model seemed good according to all methods except that bad contacts were found by Whatif for residues 450 and higher and that Errat reported two suspicious regions at residues 381 to 407 and around 460. The only residue involved in the binding that did not seem to be in a very good environment seemed to be Leu396.
Visualisation of molecular structure
All images of the molecular structures in Figure 2 were created using WeblabViewer Pro (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Hydrogen bonds in Table 1 were calculated using PdbViewer (Guex & Peitsch, 1997).
Prediction of DnaK-binding motifs on mitochondrial presequences
The prediction was performed according to the DnaK-binding algorithm by RuÈ diger et al. (1997). Presequences were cut into short peptides of 13-amino acid residues before running the algorithm. The adjacent peptides were overlapped by 12 amino acid residues. Every peptide was scored according to the algorithm. The whole process was very similar to a scanning window moving along the presequence one amino acid residue per step.
Inhibition of refolding of denatured luciferase by synthesized peptides
Luciferase unfolding and refolding was performed as described by Buchberger et al. (1994). Luciferase activity was assayed with a luminometer constructed by Bo HoÈ jer (Department of Biochemistry, Stockholm

University), which is equipped with a sensitive photomultiplier tube (Model R268, Hamamatsu TV Co., Tokyo, Japan; see MoÈ ller et al., 1994 for details). The assay was based on the protocol supplied by the manufacturer, Promega. A 66 mM luciferase stock solution was made by dissolving puri®ed luciferase in 1 M glycylglycine (pH 7.4). The stock enzyme solution was diluted ten times with unfolding buffer (25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 6 M guanidinium-HCl) and incubated at room temperature for two hours. The denatured luciferase was suspended at a ®nal concentration of 55 nM in refolding medium containing 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mM Mg-acetate, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP and 0.5 mM DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE each. The enzyme activity was assayed by recording the luminescence after adding 1 ml of refolded enzyme to 50 ml of luciferase assay reagent.
Calculation of the hydrophobic binding area of the presequence heptapeptides with DnaK and mt-hsp70
Each sequence of the synthesized 13-mer peptide was cut into pieces of seven amino acid residues. The conformation of the heptapeptides was modeled after the NRLLLTG peptide crystallized with DnaK (Zhu et al., 1996) using ICM (Abagyan et al., 1994) according to the script supplied by the program. The heptapeptides were docked into the binding pocket of both mt-hsp70 and DnaK. The complete system was minimized in torsional space using default parameters from ICM. The buried hydrophobic surface area was then calculated for each heptapeptide in the modeling program. Three peptides for which binding af®nity to DnaK had been tested with biochemical methods (Gragerov et al., 1994; Zhu et al., 1996) were used as control peptides. Of these three, two were negative controls, which did not bind DnaK and one of them was a positive control, which is a good binder to DnaK.
