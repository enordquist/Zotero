Rapid protein-structure determination relies greatly on software that can automatically build a protein model into an experimental electron-density map. In favorable circumstances, various software systems are capable of building over 90% of the ®nal model. However, completeness falls off rapidly with the resolution of the diffraction data. Manual completion of these partial models is usually feasible, but is time-consuming and prone to subjective interpretation. Except for the N- and C-termini of the chain, the end points of each missing fragment are known from the initial model. Hence, ®tting fragments reduces to an inverse-kinematics problem. A method has been developed that combines fast inverse-kinematics algorithms with a real-space torsion-angle re®nement procedure in a two-stage approach to ®t missing main-chain fragments into the electron density between two anchor points. The ®rst stage samples a large number of closing conformations, guided by the electron density. These candidates are ranked according to density ®t. In a subsequent re®nement stage, optimization steps are projected onto a carefully chosen subspace of conformation space to preserve rigid geometry and closure. Experimental results show that ®tted fragments are in excellent agreement with the ®nal re®ned structure for lengths of up to 12±15 residues in areas of weak or ambiguous electron density, even at medium to low resolution.

1. Introduction
The Protein Structure Initiative (PSI), a National Institute of General Medical Sciences program in the US, aims to reduce the time and associated costs of determining a threedimensional protein structure. Stimulated in part by funding initiatives such as the PSI, the experimental and computational methods used for X-ray structure determination have been greatly improved. Many of the sample-preparation steps including protein expression, puri®cation and crystallization have been automated and turned into large-scale production facilities (Lesley et al., 2002). Various third-generation synchrotrons now feature highly automated protein crystallography beamlines and allow collection of a complete X-ray diffraction data set in a matter of minutes (Walsh et al., 1999; Cohen et al., 2002; van den Bedem et al., 2003). Such developments require an ever-increasing rate at which macromolecular structures need to be solved. Further automation of all computational aspects of structure determination is therefore highly desirable to avoid it becoming a ratelimiting step (Burley et al., 1999; Adams et al., 2003).

There have also been tremendous advances in automated model-building methods. Various software systems are now capable of building a protein model into an electron-density map without human intervention (Ioerger & Sacchettini, 2003; Levitt, 2001; Perrakis et al., 1999; Terwilliger, 2003). The PHENIX project (Adams et al., 2002) aims to automate structure solution from reduced intensity data to a re®ned model, even at medium to low resolution. Indeed, in favorable cases it is now possible to proceed from diffraction data to an initial model of a new protein structure in a few hours.
However, the degree of completeness of these initial models, i.e. the fraction of atoms or residues correctly placed, varies widely depending on the quality of the experimental data and rarely reaches 100%. Determining the atomic coordinates of mobile fragments in the molecule, for instance, remains a challenge. Such fragments may lead to disorder in the crystal, rendering interpretation of the resulting electron density dif®cult. Manually completing a partial protein model, i.e. building the missing residues, is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process which can take a few weeks of work depending on the resolution and size of the structure. Thus, this step still presents a substantial bottleneck to any highthroughput structure-determination effort.
In practice, a large portion of the molecule has often been resolved and the N- and C-termini of a fragment in the initial model are known. The missing main-chain fragment can be modeled as a kinematic chain, with rigid groups of atoms as links and rotatable bonds as joints. Fitting a fragment between two anchor points can thus be interpreted as an inversekinematics (IK) problem (Craig, 1989; Manocha & Zhu, 1994; Manocha et al., 1995): given the position and orientation of the end point of a kinematic chain, can the corresponding values of the joint angles be determined? Exploiting this observation, we have combined inverse-kinematics algorithms with a realspace torsion-angle re®nement procedure in a two-stage approach to ®t a missing main-chain fragment into a protein model.
In a test set of 103 structurally diverse fragments within one protein, the algorithm closed gaps of 12 residues in length to within, on average, 0.52 AÊ all-atom root-mean-square deviation (aaRMSD1) from the ®nal re®ned structure at a resolution of 2.8 AÊ . The algorithm has also been tested and used to aid protein-model completion in areas of weak or ambiguous experimental electron density, where an initial model was built using ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999) or RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2003). At a resolution of 2.4 AÊ , it closed a tenresidue gap to within 0.43 AÊ aaRMSD of the ®nal re®ned structure. In another case, a 14-residue gap in a 51% complete model built at 2.6 AÊ was closed to within 0.9 AÊ aaRMSD. Furthermore, our method was used to correctly identify and build multiple alternative main-chain conformations at a resolution of 1.8 AÊ .
1 The algorithm ®ts a main chain consisting of {N, C, C, C, O} atoms. aaRMSD is the square root of the averaged squared distances between all corresponding atoms. It is calculated after the loops are optimally aligned in three dimensions.

2. Background A variety of techniques have found successful application and widespread use in automated interpretation of electrondensity maps. The program ARP/wARP, for instance, iterates interpretation of the electron-density map, model building and re®nement using a hybrid model consisting of a conventional protein model and a set of free atoms (Morris et al., 2002). The program TEXTAL (Ioerger & Sacchettini, 2003) employs local pattern-recognition techniques to select regions from a database of previously determined structures, similar to those in the unknown structure. Some automated systems, targeting lower resolution levels, notably RESOLVE and MAID (Levitt, 2001), start by identifying larger secondary-structure elements using sophisticated template-matching techniques and then connect these `®ts' through loop regions.
Relying on unambiguous experimental data and elementary stereochemical constraints, areas of weak or ambiguous electron density remain a challenge for these approaches. For instance, exposed mobile-loop regions typically have poorly resolved side-chain density or show discontinuous main-chain density even at low contour levels. Patterns in the density may go unnoticed in template-matching techniques for a variety of reasons. The electron density may exhibit multimodal disorder, in which the protein main chain adopts two or more distinct conformations for a number of contiguous residues (Wilson & Brunger, 2000). Nevertheless, at high resolution these programs may provide over 90% of the protein main chain of the ®nal model (Badger, 2003). At resolution levels beyond 2.3 AÊ , the initial model resulting from these programs is typically a gapped polypeptide chain and only about twothirds completeness is attained in the range 2.3 d < 2.9 AÊ . In the majority of cases, the amino-acid sequence is correctly assigned, so gap lengths and the identity of their residues are known.
In practice, to complete a model the crystallographer manually builds the missing residues onto the partially completed structure using an interactive graphics program. These programs, such as the X-BUILD package in QUANTA, InsightII (both from Accelrys Inc.) and O (Jones & Kjeldgaard, 1997) provide a variety of semi-automated tools and techniques to assist the model-building and re®nement steps. In O, database fragments straddling a gap can be re®ned against the density using torsion-angle re®nement based on grid summation (Jones et al., 1991). Old®eld (2001) developed a method combining a random search of conformation space with grid- and gradient-based re®nement techniques to close loops. InsightII employs the random-tweak algorithm (Fine et al., 1986; Shenkin et al., 1987) to build fragments.
In robotics, it is well known that for manipulators in a threedimensional workspace there are a ®nite number of solutions to the IK problem when the number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) does not exceed six. In the case of a serial manipulator with six revolute joints, which is the most relevant to protein fragments, an analytic solution exists and the number of unique solutions is at most 16 (Raghavan & Roth, 1989).
Go" and Scheraga were the ®rst to study analytical loop closure, limited to six DoFs, in the context of macromolecules

research papers
(Go" & Scheraga, 1970). Practical applications of their method and subsequent improvements (Wedemeyer & Scheraga, 1999) are limited; when restricting the DoFs to 9, 2 angles, the loop length can not exceed three residues. Recently, this limitation was overcome by extending the domain to any three, not necessarily consecutive, residues with arbitrary geometry (Coutsias et al., 2004).
In the general case of N > 6 dihedral angles, the chain has redundant DoFs; the inverse-kinematics system of equations is underdetermined. Rather than solving directly for the dihedral angles, numerical methods are employed to sample conformational space.
Search methods sample from a set of conformational parameters and include sampling biased by the database distribution of the 9/2-angle pairs (Moult & James, 1986), uniform conformational search (Bruccoleri & Karplus, 1987), sampling from a discrete set of 9/2 pairs (Deane & Blundell, 2000; DePristo et al., 2003) or sampling from a small library of short representative fragments (Kolodny et al., 2005). Extracting candidate fragments from the PDB satisfying conditions on length and geometry started with Jones & Thirup (1986) and was further developed by Fidelis et al. (1994), van Vlijmen & Karplus (1997) and Du et al. (2003). Various methods exist for optimization of candidate loops, such as molecular dynamics (Bruccoleri & Karplus, 1987; Fiser et al., 2000; Zheng et al., 1992) and Monte Carlo (Abagyan & Totrov, 1994; Collura et al., 1993) simulations.
Another class of methods iteratively solves the inversekinematics system of equations. The aforementioned randomtweak method closes a loop by iteratively changing all its DoFs at once until the desired distances between the two termini are reached. It employs the Jacobian of these distances with respect to torsional DoFs to calculate the DoF changes. The cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm (Canutescu & Dunbrack, 2003; Wang & Chen, 1991) adjusts one DoF at a time along the chain to move the ®nal segment of the loop toward the target residue. It is free from singularities and allows constraints on any of the DoFs.
3. Methods
The objective is to automatically ®t a missing protein fragment in between two anchor residues, satisfying electron-density constraints. The algorithm assumes rigid peptide geometry; residue-dependent values for bond lengths and bond angles are derived from small-molecule data (Engh & Huber, 1991). To limit the number of DoFs (and thus computational complexity) in the current implementation, side chains are truncated at the C atom.
The algorithm proceeds in two stages: candidate generation and re®nement. In the ®rst stage, 1000 candidate gap-closing fragments are built using the CCD algorithm, while putting additional constraints on the DoFs to take electron density and collision avoidance into account.2 Next, a cross-

is

calculated for these candidates, where &o and &c denote the

normalized observed and calculated density, respectively. The

99th percentile (with a maximum of six fragments) is passed

on to stage two, which re®nes atomic coordinates by mini-

mizing a standard real-space target function (Diamond, 1971;

Chapman, 1995; Korostelev et al., 2002). An optimization

protocol based on simulated annealing (SA; Kirkpatrick et al.,

1983) and Monte Carlo minimization (MCM; Li & Scheraga,

1987) uses the redundant DoFs of the fragment to search for

the global minimum of the target function while maintaining

ideal peptide geometry and loop closure. Each fragment is

subjected to four SA re®nement cycles, the two top-scoring

fragments of which are retained.

The input to the algorithm is given by the electron density,

in most cases a 2mFo À DFc map (Read, 1986), the partial model and the amino-acid sequence. The program outputs all

12 fragments it retains. It also writes a log ®le containing the

full cross-correlation electron-density score for each fragment.

Final conformations will need to be re®ned using standard

maximum-likelihood re®nement programs such as CNS

(BruÈ nger et al., 1998) or REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997).

The implementation of the algorithm uses the following soft-

ware packages: Clipper (Cowtan, 2004), the CCP4 Coordinate

Library (Krissinel, 2004) and the exact IK solver of Coutsias et

al. (2004).

3.1. Stage 1: generation

Residues ¯anking the gap in the partial model are denoted

N- and C-stationary anchors. The algorithm starts by

constructing a protein fragment g of length L in a random

initial conformation (x3.1.1), where residue 0 is a copy of the

N-stationary anchor and residue L À 1 is a copy of the

C-stationary anchor. This chain is attached to either the N- or

C-anchor, thus determining the closing direction. The

remaining terminal residue in g is called the mobile anchor.

Upon starting the procedure, the position of the mobile

anchor will not coincide with the position of the stationary

anchor. The algorithm iteratively adjusts each backbone

dihedral angle in turn to satisfy a closure constraint, mini-

mizing the distance between the three backbone atoms of the

mobile anchor and the corresponding atoms of the stationary

anchor as follows. Working its way down the chain, at residue i

the CCD algorithm proposes a dihedral angle 9i that minimizes the distance between the mobile anchor and stationary

anchor. Based on 9i, it also proposes a minimizing angle 2i. (In our implementation, we change each DoF in turn, although

this is not strictly necessary.) Thus, a proposed angle pair 9Y 2pi is obtained. To guide the fragment, a heuristic electron-density constraint has been added to the CCD algorithm. For 9Y 2pi , denote by Ai the set of atoms {Ci, Ci, Oi, Ni+1, Ci1} subject to change by this angle pair, but not affected by changes in angle pair i + 1. Electron-density scores are

calculated for trial conformations in a square neighborhood

positions of Ai. The angle pair (9, 2)i is then set to the trial position with maximum score. At this point, overlaps of van der Waals surfaces of atoms in Ai and the rest of the protein structure are determined. If no overlaps occur, the new (9, 2)i pair is accepted, otherwise the pair is accepted with a probability inversely related to the amount of overlap. The size of U0Y2p is reduced linearly in the number of CCD iterations to allow closure of the chain.
It was found that longer fragments ®t the electron density better when built from both the N- and C-stationary anchors to meet in the middle. Fragments of nine or more residues are therefore split in the middle and each half-chain is attached to its corresponding anchor. The terminal residue of each halfchain alternates between acting as stationary anchor and mobile anchor in subsequent iterations.
Each initial conformation is allowed 2000 iterations for closure, up to a preset tolerance distance dclosed. Chains that do not close are discarded.
3.1.1. Random initial conformations. For each initial conformation, 3i is considered to be a ®xed N(180, 5.8) random variable for all i. Half of the initial conformations are obtained by adjusting each (9, 2)i in turn to optimize agreement with the electon density while stereochemical constraints are observed. The remaining 500 initial conformations are purely random and obtained from sampling (9, 2)i, i = 0 F F F L À 1 angle pairs from PDB-derived distributions. Finite mixtures of bivariate normal distributions were therefore ®tted to frequencies calculated from the Top500 database (Lovell et al., 2003) of non-redundant protein structures using the program EMMIX (McLachlan et al., 1999). We obtained distributions for each of the 20 amino acids and an additional distribution for residues immediately preceding proline in the amino-acid sequence. The angles 90 and 2LÀ1 remain ®xed at their initial values.

3.2. Stage 2: refinement

A candidate fragment is re®ned by minimizing the least-

squares residuals between the observed density &o and the

density calculated from the model &c in some volume V

The calculated density at each grid point is a sum of contributions of all atoms whose center lies within a cutoff distance from this point. The calculated density contribution of an atom is a sum of isotropic three-dimensional Gaussians (Waasmaier & Kirfel, 1995). The factors S and k scale &o to &c and are computed once at initialization using the partial model.
3.2.1. Optimization with closure constraints. The redundant DoFs de®ne a subspace of conformation space termed the self-motion manifold. Motions on this manifold do not in¯uence the position and orientation of the end point and thus can be used to move the fragment towards a minimum of the target function (Burdick, 1989; Khatib, 1987). Since this manifold may be very complex, these motions are in general dif®cult to calculate. We therefore use a local linear approx-

imation of the self-motion manifold; the null-space of the
Jacobian matrix of the fragment (Craig, 1989). For an n-DoF fragment in 3 at conformation q, the Jacobian J(q) is a 6 Â n
matrix satisfying the equation

x  JqqX

2

Thus, J(q) = df(q)/d(q), where f(q) is the fragment's forwardkinematics function mapping DoF parameters to end-point position and orientation. The rank of the Jacobian in 3 is at most 6 and thus the dimensionality of its null space is at least n À 6. An instantaneous change in the conformation corresponding to a desired small change in end-point position is calculated by inverting (2). We obtain

q  Jyqx  NqNTqyY

3

where Jy is the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian and N(q) is an orthonormal basis for the null space. The null space can now be used to optimize the target function without affecting the position of the end point. The instantaneous change in position and orientation of the end point, x, is set to zero and y is taken to be the gradient vector of the target function. Projecting y onto the null space of the Jacobian produces a motion that minimizes the target function without disturbing closure.
3.2.2. Implementation details. The null space of the Jacobian is obtained from a singular-value decomposition of the Jacobian matrix. The null-space basis N(q) is the set of right singular vectors corresponding to vanishing singular values. We derived an analytical expression for the gradient of the target function with respect to the torsional DoFs of the loop. It is calculated using a recursive method (Abe et al., 1984) linear in the number of DoFs of the fragment.
A gradient-descent search for the minimum of the target function is prone to become stuck in local minima. The MCM approach is well known for its ability to overcome this problem. At each step, a large random move in conformation space is proposed, the new conformation is then minimized by gradient descent and the resulting local minimum is accepted or rejected using the Metropolis criterion (Metropolis et al., 1953). Minimization increases the acceptance probability of the trial move, enabling the search to make more progress.

research papers

This comes at the cost of increasing the time of each simulation step.
Two methods are used for generating random moves for MCM. The ®rst is to take a step in a random direction in the null space (Yakey et al., 2001). Before performing minimization, we make sure the closure tolerance has not been exceeded. A second method for generating random steps is an exact IK solver (Coutsias et al., 2004). One of the solutions is chosen at random as the proposed move. The use of an exact solver allows jumping between unconnected parts of the selfmotion manifold. The closure constraint is relaxed during the re®nement stage and a maximum RMSD of 0.5 AÊ is allowed at both ends of the loop. By relaxing closure, larger steps can be taken in the null space of the Jacobian.
The re®nement protocol is composed of three nested loops, see Fig. 1. The inner loop performs an MCM search by using the two methods described above for generating random trial moves. The middle loop performs SA by gradually reducing the pseudo-temperature of the MCM search. The outer loop enhances the SA protocol by simulating restarts each time at a lower starting pseudo-temperature. The magnitude of attempted random null-space moves is reduced together with the current pseudo-temperature of the simulation to increase

the chance that the random moves will be accepted. Decreasing levels of smoothing are applied to the density after each restart. The density map is smoothed by convolving it with an isotropic three-dimensional Gaussian kernel.
4. Results and discussion The performance of the algorithm was ®rst evaluated on a test set of structurally diverse fragments at various truncated resolution levels. Next, we tested its ability to fully complete initial protein models at comparable resolution levels by closing all the gaps in three initial models, this time using `real' data. Furthermore, we evaluated the algorithm's ability to identify alternative conformations in a disordered region.
4.1. Performance at various resolutions, fragment lengths and their secondary structure
4.1.1. TM1621. A set of 103 structurally diverse fragments was obtained by creating gaps of length four, eight, 12 and 15 at each even-numbered residue of a test structure, the protein TM1621 (PDB code 1o1z; SCOP classi®cation /). TM1621 consists of one chain, with 34% of the residues in ten -helices

and 19% in nine -sheets. Diffraction data for this 234-residue protein structure had been collected at a resolution of 1.6 AÊ . To evaluate the performance at various resolution levels, three 2mFo À DFc electron-density maps were calculated at 2.0, 2.5 and 2.8 AÊ , using structure factors obtained from the PDB. For each gap, the fragment with the highest cross-correlation electron-density score was selected from the 12 fragments output by the program. Since low-resolution electron-density maps were obtained by truncation, the RMSDs in this section are not typical for their resolution levels.
At a resolution of 2.0 AÊ , the algorithm successfully closed all 103 gaps of length four to within 1.0 AÊ and all length eight gaps to within 0.85 AÊ , as shown in Fig. 2. Wider gaps are more dif®cult to close; a total of nine 12-residue and nine 15-residue fragments were found to have an aaRMSD greater than 1.0 AÊ .
To evaluate the effect of secondary structure on aaRMSD, all 12- and 15-residue fragments were classi®ed as helix, strand or `other'. A fragment is considered a helix or strand only if at least two-thirds of its residues are classi®ed as such. A total of 14 12-residue fragments and eight 15-residue fragments met our criteria for helices. Three 12-residue fragments and no 15-residue fragments were classi®ed as strands. The maximum aaRMSD for the 12-residue strands over all resolutions was

4.1.2. Run times. The run time of the

algorithm depends on the length of the

fragment to be ®tted, as well as on the

resolution of the diffraction data. Run times

vary from about 30 min for short fragments

to just under 3 h for the longest fragments at

high resolution. Table 2 summarizes average

run times calculated while generating the

103 fragments used in this section. All tests

were performed on a 2.66 GHz Intel P4

Xeon running RedHat 9. The source code

was compiled using gcc 3.2.

It is to be expected that targeting areas of

weak or ambiguous electron density, where

standard model-building algorithms fail, is

computationally expensive. However,

average execution times may be reduced by

alternating generation and re®nement

stages together with the introduction of a

stopping criteria based on a variety of local scores such as density ®t and Ramachandran scores.

The aaRMSD to the native structure is 2.72 AÊ . (b) The re®ned fragment corresponding to (a) shown in magenta. The aaRMSD improved by 2.4 AÊ to 0.31 AÊ . A closed conformation is maintained throughout re®nement. The 2.5 AÊ 2mFo À DFc electron-density map is contoured at 1.5'.

SCOP classi®cation multi-domain /,

multi-helical), a protein with a helical

domain, gives similar results (see Table 3).

TM0423 consists of one chain, with 46% of

the residues in 16 helices and 11% in eight

-sheets. The longest helix has length 17 and

if a single glycine classi®ed as a hydrogen-

bonded turn is included its length is 26.

Clearly, the algorithm performs more

modestly when ®tting longer fragments. In

addition to an increasing median aaRMSD,

a larger proportion of fragments deviate by more than 1.0 AÊ as fragment length

increases, particularly when a large number

of residues are in -helical conformation.

The latter effect arises from the nature of

the CCD algorithm; choosing distance-

minimizing dihedral angles at every itera-

tion naturally leads to an extended conformation. It has been observed in previous studies that accurately modeling secondarystructure elements may require specialized

augmented by a closing constraint. The performance of the second stage in the algorithm also re¯ects this insight. For instance, in x4.1.1 it was found that 12-residue fragments have a mean (median) aaRMSD of 0.41 AÊ (0.34 AÊ ) to the native structure at a resolution of 2.5 AÊ . Their corresponding stageone fragments have mean and median distances of 1.38 and 1.23 AÊ , respectively. In fact, for one in ®ve fragments, the second stage lowered the aaRMSD by more than 1.5 AÊ , with a few cases even exceeding 2.5 AÊ (see Fig. 6).

4.2. Missing fragments
In this section, we present three examples of protein-model completion by inserting main-chain fragments into a gapped initial model at high and medium-to-low resolution. Rather than closing a few selected gaps, we aimed to fully complete each model. Thus, we calculated all missing fragments of length 15 residues or less in each model.
In one instance, the hypothetical protein TM1586, the algorithm was actively used to complete the model and detailed results will appear in a separate publication. The remaining two structures had been completed and re®ned prior to testing the algorithm. All initial models were obtained from common crystallographic model-building programs.
It was found that residues ¯anking a gap in partial models do not always ®t the density correctly. In these cases, the gap was widened by trimming back one or more residues at the N and/or C end of the gap until the new anchors ®t the density satisfactorily. Furthermore, missing fragments of length less than four are extended to length four in this section, again by trimming back residues at both ends of the gap.
The electron-density score of generated fragments and RMSD to the ®nal re®ned structure cannot expected to be perfectly correlated in areas of poor density. In an extreme case, it may happen that conformations attain a higher score by jumping over to a neighboring empty stretch of density (a -sheet, for instance) for a few residues. In this section, in addition to the aaRMSD of the best scoring fragment, we therefore report the lowest achieved aaRMSD among the 12 fragments output by the program.
4.2.1. TM1586 at 2.0 AÊ . An initial model for the 206residue hypothetical protein TM1586 was produced using Xsolve, a fully automated crystallographic data-processing and structure-solution software suite under development at the JCSG. Xsolve utilizes standard crystallographic software packages to obtain a protein model.
An experimental electron-density map was obtained from MAD data collected at 2.0 AÊ with the program SOLVE v2.03 (Terwilliger & Berendzen, 1999). The initial model, obtained with RESOLVE v2.06, showed gaps between residues 86±98, 107±117 and 142±150. Furthermore, 66 residues were missing at the N-terminus of the molecule. Overall completeness was reported to be 51%. After widening the gap between residues 142±150 by one residue at each end, it was easily closed to within 0.5 AÊ aaRMSD. The gaps between residues 86±98 and 107±117 proved to be more dif®cult; the density was too weak

for the crystallographer to decide which fragment among the 12 candidates ®tted the electron density best.
The extended RESOLVE model was then combined with an ARP/wARP model and after various rounds of phase improvements the N-terminus was largely recovered. The map was further slightly improved using a combination of SHELXD (Schneider & Sheldrick, 2002) and autoSHARP (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997; Vonrhein et al., 2005). The model still showed gaps between residues 13±23, 49±52, 89±99 and 105±113. These missing fragments were all located on one face of the molecule and the density remained weak in this area. Three residues at the C-terminus of the ®rst gap did not adequately ®t the density and the gap was widened to span residues 13±27. Gap 49±52 was widened to 47±53 and gap 105± 113 was extended by one residue at the C-terminus. After generating these fragments and further manual re®nement, the resulting structure was subsequently re®ned with REFMAC5. Table 4 shows the aaRMSD of fragments to this ®nal re®ned model.
The density score and the aaRMSD are poorly correlated, re¯ecting the weak density in the area of the missing fragments. Even though the ®rst fragment has a fairly high aaRMSD, it still provided a good starting point for manual re®nement. Fig. 7 shows residues 89±99 of the ®nal re®ned structure together with the best fragment that was generated. Note that the main-chain density is discontinuous at the displayed contour level of 0.8' and that side-chain density is poorly de®ned.

script resulted in an 88% complete model, with gaps between residues 17±25, 56±62, 129±132, 146±148 and 229±231. Furthermore, the region between residues 191 and 202 had been built incorrectly. The RESOLVE model was independently completed and re®ned. Table 5 summarizes the aaRMSD of top-scoring fragments built with our algorithm to the ®nal re®ned structure.
4.2.3. TM0542 at 2.6 AÊ . MAD data for the 376-residue protein TM0542 (malate oxidoreductase) was collected at a resolution of 3.0 AÊ and a native data set was obtained at 2.6 AÊ . An electron-density map was calculated with phase extension using the program SOLVE. Iterative model building using SOLVE revealed that the unit cell contains four NCS-related molecules. Molecule A was the most complete of this set of four with 56% of residues placed and gaps between residues 12±89, 134±142, 212±227, 256±266, 272±285 and 318±324. This RESOLVE starting model was independently manually completed and re®ned. The re®ned model was used to calculate RMSDs for our automatically generated fragments.
The algorithm successfully closed all gaps up to 15 residues in length in the protein. Table 6 summarizes the results.
Fitting a main-chain fragment into the density is rather sensitive to residues being ¯ipped along the chain. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that exposed loop regions typically have poorly resolved side chains in the electron density. Fig. 8 shows an example of a fragment where two consecutive residues are ¯ipped. While the aaRMSD is relatively high at 0.9 AÊ for this fragment, the C trace is in excellent agreement with the manually built fragment. The ¯ipped residues are easy to identify and correct for a trained crystallographer.
4.3. Identifying alternative main-chain conformations
Binding of ligands to proteins and protein±protein interactions are typically facilitated by mobile regions in the macromolecule. Such ¯exible fragments sometimes crystallize in multimodal disordered substates, in which the main chain adopts two or more distinct conformations for a number of contiguous residues. It is generally dif®cult to recognize features in the resulting areas of overlapping density, even for a trained crystallographer. Here, we show that the techniques introduced in this paper can be extended to support identi®cation and modeling of multiple distinct conformations, even at a resolution of 1.8 AÊ .
A model for the 398-residue protein TM0755 (PDB code 1vme) was built from a 1.8 AÊ MAD data set using ARP/

wARP. The structure was completed manually, apart from a short fragment around residue A320 and the same fragment around B320. The electron density from residues A317±A323 indicated that this fragment was bimodally disordered. Furthermore, a structurally similar dioxygen-reduction enzyme, rubredoxin oxygen:oxidoreductase (PDB code 1e5d), binds a ¯avin mononucleotide at the corresponding residues. The absence of this cofactor in TM0755 allows the main chain to adopt other energetically favored conformations. A detailed analysis of TM0755 will appear in a separate forthcoming publication.
While one conformation was clearly visible in the electron density, the main-chain trace of the alternative conformation was much less obvious. From residue A320 to A323, the density was particularly ambiguous; the alternative conformation was dif®cult to identify and not modeled. The algorithm was slightly modi®ed to model the fragment from residue A317 to A323; half-occupancy was hard-coded and density smoothing was disabled to narrow the radius of convergence of the re®nement stage. Runs at four different lengths were attempted. The N-anchor was kept ®xed at SerA316 and the C-anchor ranged from AlaA320 to HisA323. In the ®nal run, four out of the ®nal 12 fragments adopted conformation 1, another three adopted conformation 2 and the remaining ®ve fragments did not ®t the density meaningfully. The aaRMSDs between these fragments and the ®nal re®ned model are 0.42 AÊ for conformation 1 and 0.29 AÊ for conformation 2. Fig. 9 depicts the ®nal re®ned model of the two alternative conformations for residues A317±A321 in an omit electron-density map. In conformation 1, the terminal OH group of TyrA318 is engaged in hydrogen bonds with GluB29 and LysB336. GluA319 is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule and to LysB336. Further stability is provided by a salt bridge between GluA319 and AspB335. GluA321 is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule. In conformation 2, the main-chain rotates to occupy the empty ¯avin mononucleotide-binding cavity. Fig. 10 depicts the ¯avin mononucleotide from the enzyme rubredoxin oxygen:oxidoreductase superimposed onto the corresponding residues of its binding site in TM0755. The side chain of TyrA318 rests in the hydrophobic pocket. Ramachandran analysis (Lovell et al., 2003) of the ®nal re®ned model showed that the dihedral angles of both conformations are all in favored (>98%) or allowed (>99.8%) regions. Real-space correlation coef®cients for residues A316± A323 of the ®nal re®ned model are listed in Table 7. The Rfree value for the ®nal model with both conformations present is 0.183, compared with 0.189 when conformation 1 is omitted and 0.187 when 2 is omitted.

extension to the current algorithm is therefore the ability to identify ¯ipped residues. Although easy to detect and correct manually once the fragment is built, it requires an additional step of human

intervention before the model can be

submitted to re®nement. It is anticipated

that elementary heuristic techniques will

greatly reduce the occurrence of ¯ipped

residues. Similarly, incorporation of specia-

lized algorithms to identify and model

secondary-structure elements will enhance

the performance in building long -helices.
