Summary

Stress-inducible molecular chaperones have essential roles in maintaining protein homeostasis , but the extent to which they affect overall proteome stability remains unclear. Here, we analyze the effects of the DnaK (Hsp70) system on protein stability in Escherichia coli using pulse proteolysis combined with quantitative proteomics . We quantify ∼1,500 soluble proteins and find ∼500 of these to be protease sensitive under normal growth conditions, indicating a high prevalence of conformationally dynamic proteins, forming a metastable subproteome. Acute heat stress results in the unfolding of an additional ∼200 proteins, reflected in the exposure of otherwise buried hydrophobic regions. Overexpression of the DnaK chaperone system markedly stabilizes numerous thermo-sensitive proteins, including multiple ribosomal proteins and large, hetero-oligomeric proteins containing the evolutionarily ancient c.37 fold (P loop nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases). Thus, the Hsp70 system, in addition to its known chaperone functions, has a remarkable capacity to stabilize proteins in their folded states under denaturing stress conditions.

Introduction

Native proteins are structurally dynamic ( Gershenson et al., 2014 ), and thus the cellular proteome requires constant conformational surveillance by an integrated network of chaperones and protein degradation machineries to maintain a functional state ( Balch et al., 2008 , Balchin et al., 2016 , Wolff et al., 2014 ). External and endogenous stress conditions may cause proteins to undergo partial or complete unfolding events, which can result in aberrant interactions and the formation of potentially toxic aggregates. Molecular chaperones prevent such off-pathway reactions ( Balchin et al., 2016 , Clerico et al., 2015 , Frydman, 2001 ), but the extent to which the proteome is conformationally destabilized under stress conditions and the protective capacities of chaperone systems have not yet been analyzed in detail.

The highly conserved Hsp70 chaperones serve as a central hub of the protein homeostasis system ( Bhandari and Houry, 2015 , Clerico et al., 2015 , Mayer and Bukau, 2005 , Mayer and Gierasch, 2019 ). DnaK, the main bacterial Hsp70, functions by binding and releasing, in an ATP-dependent manner, hydrophobic polypeptide segments that are exposed in non-native proteins ( Clerico et al., 2015 , Mayer, 2013 , Rüdiger et al., 1997 ). DnaK functionally cooperates with the Hsp40 co-chaperone DnaJ and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE. During de novo protein folding , DnaK functions downstream of the ribosome-binding chaperone trigger factor (TF) ( Deuerling et al., 1999 , Teter et al., 1999 ). Moreover, DnaK is strongly upregulated under heat stress (HS) to counteract protein aggregation ( Mogk et al., 1999 ). Approximately 700 newly synthesized and preexisting proteins, which make up ∼25% of the cytosolic proteome, have been shown to interact with DnaK ( Calloni et al., 2012 ).

Pulse proteolysis (PP) has recently emerged as a powerful method to study, at the proteome level and in a quantitative manner, the factors that affect protein stability. As under steady-state conditions proteins are in equilibrium between folded and unfolded states, local or overall unfolding events frequently take place. PP can quantify non-native conformations by taking advantage of the fact that unfolded proteins are more susceptible to proteolysis than folded proteins ( Park et al., 2007 , Park and Marqusee, 2005 ). Folded states remain largely intact, as the fraction of protein that unfolds during the short protease pulse is small. In conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS), PP has been used to study protein folding or conformational changes in complex samples ( Adhikari and Fitzgerald, 2014 , Feng et al., 2014 , Leuenberger et al., 2017 , Tran et al., 2014 ).

Here, we performed PP with thermolysin and quantitative proteomics on amino acid isotope-labeled Escherichia coli (PP-SILAC [stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture]) to analyze the effects of the DnaK chaperone system on proteome stability. We found numerous ribosomal proteins as well as large, multi-domain proteins to be susceptible to HS-induced unfolding, with protease cleavage occurring in hydrophobic sequence regions that are normally buried in the native state. In particular, proteins with domains of the evolutionarily ancient c.37 fold (P loop nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases) are significantly enriched in the thermo-sensitive subproteome. Overexpression of the DnaK chaperone machinery before heat treatment markedly stabilized numerous thermo-sensitive proteins in their folded conformations. Hsp70 may carry out this action by reversing kinetically trapped misfolded states, thereby shifting the equilibrium of folding intermediates toward native states.
Results
PP Workflow

To analyze the conformational stability of proteins, we labeled MC4100 E. coli cells with heavy (H) arginine and lysine isotopes at 37°C and prepared live spheroplasts . PP was performed with the metallo-proteinase thermolysin for 1 min during rapid hypo-osmotic cell lysis and efficiently stopped with EDTA ( Figure 1 A), as demonstrated with the intrinsically unstructured α-synuclein (α-Syn) as the substrate ( Figure S1 A). Thermolysin has a broad cleavage specificity with a preference for hydrophobic amino acids that are normally buried in the core of folded proteins ( Tables S1 A and S1B). Unlabeled spheroplasts (light, L) were treated identically but received no protease . Equal amounts of lysate from L- and H-spheroplasts were mixed and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel digestion with trypsin and liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis ( Figure 1 A). The tryptic peptides of a stable protein will show an H:L isotope ratio of 1, whereas a ratio <1 indicates that the protein is sensitive to PP. Stable proteolytic fragments (domains) generated by PP would show H:L ratios >1 ( Figure 1 A). This analysis allows quantification of the extent of cleavage, and thus of protein stability. Note that the steady-state concentration of newly synthesized (presumably not yet folded and/or assembled) proteins in exponentially growing E. coli cells is ≤1.0% of the total and is expected to be even lower in spheroplasts (see STAR Methods ). Thus, the PP-SILAC method used in this study essentially measures the stability of preexistent proteins.

Figure 1 . PP Analysis at 37°C and upon HS

(A) Schematic representation of the PP-SILAC workflow for the analysis of protease-sensitive (PS) fractions of proteins. SILAC-labeled E. coli cells (spheroplasts) are lysed with or without PP, mixed, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Quantitative proteomic analysis of SILAC ratios of tryptic peptides in gel slices enables the quantification of cleaved protein fractions. Stable proteins are in light green and unstable (protease sensitive) proteins in dark green.

(B and C) Venn diagrams of sets of proteins quantified at a NC of 37°C and after a 15-min exposure of spheroplasts to HS at 45°C (B) and of PS proteins identified under these conditions (NC-PS and HS-PS, respectively) (C). See Tables S2 A and S2B.

(D) The most abundant COG of proteins categories in the sets of NC-PS and HS-PS proteins compared to lysate control (NC). The values were normalized to the total number of PS proteins across all of the COG categories, for either the NC or the HS condition. The error bars represent means ± SEMs (n = 3). p values are based on paired t test (two-tailed): ∗ p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01, and ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001.

(E and F) Protease sensitivity of selected proteins (E) and chaperone proteins (F) in NC ( Table S2 A) and HS ( Table S2 B). The fractions cleaved by PP are indicated. The values represent means ± SEMs (n = 3).

We validated the PP-SILAC workflow using the unstructured α-Syn as a positive control and the stably folded maltose binding protein (MBP) ( Park et al., 2007 ) as a negative control. The proteins were added in isotope-labeled (H) form to the spheroplast suspension, followed by cell lysis and PP for 1 min at 37°C. After the inhibition of proteolysis, equal amounts of unlabeled (L) α-Syn and MBP were added. The concentration of thermolysin (∼120 μg/mL) was adjusted such that α-Syn was efficiently degraded upon PP (H:L <0.1 for all of the peptides identified; Figure S1 B), whereas MBP was resistant (H:L >0.9 for all of the peptides identified; Figure S1 C). In the case of α-Syn, the peptides generated by thermolysin partially or completely overlapped with tryptic peptides ( Figure S1 B), which is consistent with the unstructured nature of α-Syn. MBP was stable during PP both at 37°C and upon heat treatment (15 min at 45°C) ( Figure S1 D). In summary, PP-SILAC reliably distinguishes between stably folded and conformationally heterogeneous proteins.
PP under Normal and HS Conditions

We first performed PP-SILAC under normal growth conditions (NCs) at 37°C (henceforth designated NC) and quantified 1,540 proteins in at least 2 of 3 biological replicates with high reproducibility ( Figures 1 B and S2 A; Table S2 A). These proteins were mostly localized to the cytosol ( Figure S2 B), and their cellular abundance ranged from <50 copies per cell for the putative lipoprotein AcfD homolog (YghJ) to ∼70,000 copies for the 30S ribosomal protein S16 (RpsP) ( Schmidt et al., 2016 ; Table S2 A). Based on control experiments, the significant (p < 0.01) cutoff value for the H:L ratio that defines a protein as protease sensitive (PS) was determined to be <0.61—in other words, 39% of the total of a specific protein must be degraded ( Figure S2C ; STAR Methods ). Applying this cutoff (in at least 2 repeats), we found 501 proteins to be significantly degraded (NC-PS), corresponding to ∼25% of the quantified proteins by mass ( Figure 1 C; Table S2 A; STAR Methods ). Thus, a substantial fraction of E. coli proteins are sensitive to PP at NC, suggesting that they are conformationally dynamic and that they expose protease cleavage sites in flexible regions.

To determine protein stabilities upon acute HS, we shifted spheroplasts from 37°C to 45°C for 15 min, followed by PP at 37°C (see STAR Methods ). We reproducibly quantified 1,494 proteins (HS) ( Figure S2 D; Table S2 B) showing almost complete overlap with the 1,540 proteins quantified at NC ( Figure 1 B). A total of 685 proteins were significantly degraded by PP upon HS (HS-PS), corresponding to ∼33% of the quantified proteins by mass ( Table S2 B; STAR Methods ). These HS-PS proteins largely overlap with the set of NC-PS proteins (87%) and include 247 proteins that were not identified as NC-PS ( Figure 1 C; Table S2 B). A total of 188 proteins were significantly more protease sensitive upon HS compared to NC and are thus defined as thermo-sensitive ( Table S2 C). Note that the brief heat treatment caused only a moderate upregulation of the major stress-inducible chaperone proteins DnaK , HtpG (both ∼1.7-fold), and GroEL (∼1.2-fold) ( Table S2 D; STAR Methods ). Thus, it is unlikely that protein stabilities were substantially modulated by the cellular stress response in these experiments. Fractionation of cell lysates showed that only ∼0.8% of the total protein by mass aggregated, which is consistent with a previous report ( Winkler et al., 2010 ; Table S2 E; STAR Methods ), indicating that protein aggregation did not interfere with the PP analysis.
Functions of Protease-Sensitive Proteins

Gene Ontology (Clusters of Orthologous Groups [COG] database) analysis ( Tatusov et al., 2000 ) showed that NC-PS and HS-PS proteins are preferentially involved in the cellular processes of protein biogenesis (class J) and energy production (class C), with enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism (class G) being deenriched ( Figure 1 D). We found that NC-PS proteins have significantly more interactors than protease-stable proteins, indicating higher connectivity in the functional networks ( Figure S2 E), which is consistent with the notion that proteins having multiple interactors tend to be structurally more dynamic ( Bardwell and Jakob, 2012 ). Numerous proteins of the 30S and 50S ribosome (23 of 49 quantified ribosomal proteins) and many nucleotide-binding proteins were PP sensitive at NC ( Figure 1 E; Table S2 A), which is indicative of a high degree of structural flexibility of these protein groups. For example, the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) ErA was almost completely cleaved, while the putative tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine biosynthesis protein GcP was ∼50% degraded ( Figure 1 E). Many moderately protease-sensitive (PS) or largely stable proteins were destabilized upon HS, including the septum site-determining protein MinD , the elongation factor G (FusA), the nucleotide excision repair protein excinuclease ABC (subunit A) (UvrA), and the ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH ( Figure 1 E). These findings are consistent with HS resulting in a decrease in protein biogenesis and slow growth ( Chen et al., 2017 ). Several molecular chaperones such as HtpG (Hsp90) and TF were already completely protease sensitive (95%–100%) at NC, and thus any further destabilization upon HS could not be measured ( Figure 1 F). ClpB, HslO, DnaJ, and GrpE, while conformationally dynamic at NC (50%–60% cleaved), were further destabilized upon HS ( Figure 1 F). The small heat shock protein IbpA was specifically thermo-sensitive, suggesting that an order-to-disorder transition upon HS may play a role in its activation for client binding ( Bardwell and Jakob, 2012 , Tompa and Kovacs, 2010 ). In contrast, the Hsp70 DnaK and the chaperonin GroEL were highly protease stable ( Figure 1 F). Unlike trypsin ( Buchberger et al., 1995 ), thermolysin is inefficient in cleaving the linker between the ATPase and peptide-binding domains of DnaK, as demonstrated with purified DnaK ( Figure S2 F).
Effects of Overexpressing the DnaK System on Protein Stability

DnaK, together with its co-chaperone DnaJ and its nucleotide exchange factor GrpE, have a central role in the cytosolic chaperone network ( Calloni et al., 2012 , Mayer and Bukau, 2005 , Mayer and Gierasch, 2019 ). To gain insight into the effect of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (KJE) machinery on the overall proteome stability, we overexpressed these proteins from an isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG)-inducible plasmid for ∼1 h at NC. Cells were then further incubated at NC (NC/KJE) or exposed to HS (HS/KJE), followed by PP at 37°C. The levels of KJE increased ∼6- to 11-fold in NC/KJE cells compared to NC cells, which are ∼2-fold higher than the levels of KJE upon prolonged HS ( Figure S3 A; Table S3 A). Other cytosolic chaperones and stress-inducible proteases remained unchanged upon KJE overexpression, in contrast to prolonged HS ( Figure S3 A). Thus, overexpression of KJE allowed us to specifically assess the potential of this chaperone system in modulating protein stability.

We quantified 1,564 proteins in NC/KJE and 1,469 proteins in HS/KJE cells by PP-SILAC, and identified 454 and 594 PS proteins, respectively (NC/KJE-PS and HS/KJE-PS) ( Figures 2 A, 2B, S3 B, and S3C; Tables S3 B and S3C). These proteins overlap extensively with the set of 501 NC-PS proteins and 685 HS-PS proteins, respectively ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The NC/KJE-PS proteins amount to ∼20% of total quantified proteins and the HS/KJE-PS proteins to ∼24% by mass, compared to ∼25% and ∼33% without KJE overexpression. Overexpression of KJE stabilized 142 NC-PS proteins (p = 0.003) and 189 HS-PS proteins (p = 0.002), with an overlap of 99 proteins ( Tables S3 D and S3F). The median cleaved fraction of these proteins shifted from ∼75% to ∼30%–40% ( Figure 2 C). Thus, the DnaK chaperone machinery strongly stabilizes the proteome both at NC and upon HS.

The horizontal lines in the boxplots indicate the median; whisker caps and circles indicate the 10th–90th and 5th–95th percentiles, respectively. p value based on the Mann-Whitney test: ∗ p ≤ 0.05. The numbers of proteins analyzed are indicated in parentheses.

(F) Examples of proteins stabilized and destabilized by KJE overexpression in NC and HS. The median fractions cleaved upon PP are indicated. The error bars represent means ± SEMs (n = 3).

The KJE-stabilized proteins are preferentially ribosomal proteins, RNA-binding proteins and GTP-binding proteins ( Figure S3 D; Tables S3 D and S3F). Only 2 of 49 quantified ribosomal proteins were protease sensitive in NC/KJE and 6 in HS/KJE cells ( Figures 2 D and S3 E; Tables S2 A and S3 B), compared to 23 (NC) and 31 proteins (HS) without KJE overexpression ( Figure S3 E). These abundant proteins are highly conserved, with 19 of the 31 KJE stabilized ribosomal proteins being essential. While this result is consistent with a proposed role of DnaK in ribosome biogenesis ( René and Alix, 2011 ), the extent of cleavage observed for several ribosomal proteins (fraction cleaved ≥50%) and the almost complete stabilization afforded by KJE ( Figure 2 D) indicate that the chaperones interact with assembled ribosomes, presumably maintaining functionality upon HS. In support of this notion, sucrose density gradient analysis of cell lysates showed that ribosomes did not dissociate upon brief HS ( Figure S3 F). Many of the KJE stabilized proteins (142 in NC and 189 in HS) are known DnaK interactors ( Calloni et al., 2012 ; Tables S3 D and S3F). These proteins have more predicted DnaK binding sites compared to the control set, as is particularly apparent for the proteins stabilized upon HS ( Figure 2 E). For example, the proteins FusA and UvrA ( Figure 1 E) were markedly stabilized by KJE, essentially regaining their stability at NC ( Figure 2 F).

KJE overexpression also destabilized a small group of ∼70 proteins (p ≤ 0.003), both in NC and upon HS ( Figure 2 C; Tables S3 E and S3G). Their median protease-cleaved fraction shifted from 21% to 72% in NC/KJE and from 40% to 77% in HS/KJE cells ( Figure 2 C). These proteins also tend to contain more than average DnaK binding sites ( Figure 2 E). They function in transcription, DNA replication , and nitrogen biosynthetic processes ( Figure S3 G), including 15–18 essential proteins ( Tables S3 E and S3G). Notably, the heat shock regulator RpoH (σ 32 ), which is intrinsically unstable, was further destabilized by KJE ( Figure 2 F), as previously observed in vitro ( Rodriguez et al., 2008 ). The cellular abundance of RpoH remained unchanged upon KJE overexpression, probably due to an ∼93% depletion in the KJE cells of FtsH, the protease responsible for RpoH degradation ( Arsène et al., 2000 ; Table S3 A). MinD, another known DnaK interactor ( Calloni et al., 2012 ), as well as the ribosomal methyltransferase RlmG and the RNA-binding protein YhgF were also destabilized ( Figure 2 F). Thus, the DnaK system apparently shifts the folding equilibrium of these proteins to unfolded states.

These results indicate that the DnaK chaperone machinery has opposing effects on protein stability. While numerous proteins are conformationally stabilized, including a large set of ribosomal proteins, a smaller subset of proteins is destabilized. For some proteins, DnaK-mediated destabilization may serve a regulatory function, as in the case of RpoH ( Rodriguez et al., 2008 ).
Loss of DnaK Destabilizes the Proteome

Deletion of DnaK (together with DnaJ) results in the slow growth of E. coli and the inability to grow under HS ( Bukau and Walker, 1989 , Genevaux et al., 2004 ). The ribosome binding TF partially replaces the function of DnaK/DnaJ in folding newly synthesized proteins ( Deuerling et al., 1999 , Genevaux et al., 2004 , Teter et al., 1999 ). To assess the possible role of the DnaK chaperone system in maintaining protein stability at the normal growth temperature of 37°C, we performed PP-SILAC in Δ dnaKdnaJ (ΔKJ) cells. We quantified 1,627 proteins that largely overlap with the set of 1,540 NC proteins and found 686 proteins to be PP sensitive (NC/ΔKJ-PS) ( Figures 3 A and S4 ; Table S4 A). The NC/ΔKJ-PS proteins show a ∼90% overlap with the set of NC-PS proteins and include an additional 245 PS proteins ( Figure 3 A). Approximately 33% of all proteins by mass were sensitive to PP in ΔKJ cells, compared to ∼25% in NC cells. Exposure of ΔKJ cells to HS (15 min 45°C) had only a moderate additional destabilizing effect, with only 6 proteins being identified as thermo-sensitive ( Table S4 B). This relative protection against acute stress may be attributed to a strong constitutive upregulation of other chaperones in ΔKJ cells ( Figure 3 B; Table S4 C), which is consistent with an ∼3.7-fold increase in the abundance of RpoH ( Table S4 C). Conversely, the destabilization of proteins in ΔKJ cells at NC may be caused by not only the loss of DnaK but also a condition of chronic stress with chaperone deregulation.

(B) Abundance change of chaperone proteins in ΔKJ cells compared to NC. The average fold changes are indicated. The error bars represent SEMs (n = 3).

(C) Destabilization of proteins in ΔKJ cells. The median fractions cleaved of the set of 112 proteins destabilized in ΔKJ cells compared to NC cells are indicated (see Table S4 D).

Of the 1,400 proteins quantified in both NC and NC/ΔKJ cells, 112 PS proteins were further destabilized in NC/ΔKJ cells (p = 0.004), including 43 previously identified DnaK substrates ( Calloni et al., 2012 ; Table S4 D). The median fraction cleaved of these proteins shifted from 48% in NC cells to 81% in NC/ΔKJ cells ( Figure 3 C), which is consistent with KJ dependence for conformational maintenance. However, the overlap between the proteins stabilized by KJE upon HS (189) ( Figure 2 C) and the proteins that were destabilized in ΔKJ cells (112) ( Figure 3 C) is only 25 proteins. This suggests that constitutive deregulation of other chaperones in ΔKJ cells also contributes to protein destabilization.
Structural Properties of Protease-Sensitive Proteins

Next, we conducted bioinformatic analyses to understand how the sensitivity of proteins to PP correlates with their physicochemical and structural properties. As the reference set, the 1,306 proteins that were quantified under all growth conditions were used ( Figure S5 A). We found that thermo-sensitive (HS-TS) proteins—the set of 188 proteins that are significantly destabilized upon HS compared to NC ( Table S2 C)—are generally larger than average in size ( Figure 4 A), tend to have multiple domains ( Figure S5 B), and are more frequently found in hetero-oligomeric complexes ( Figure S5 C). Note that the shift to larger sizes is less pronounced for NC-PS proteins ( Figure 4 A). Thus, the enrichment of multi-domain proteins in the thermo-sensitive subproteome is not simply due to the presence of more potential cleavage sites in larger proteins, but does reflect a greater conformational instability. In contrast, the proteins that remain protease sensitive upon KJE overexpression or are destabilized (HS/KJE-TS proteins) are smaller than HS-TS proteins ( Figure 4 A). Most of these proteins (50%–70%) are single domain ( Figure S5 B) and tend to be monomeric, in contrast to the majority of soluble proteins (∼58% of total), which are homo-oligomeric ( Figure S5 C). This observation also supports the notion that homo-oligomeric assembly confers conformational stability ( Marsh and Teichmann, 2015 ). Conversely, proteins that are stabilized by KJE upon HS tend to be larger in size, less hydrophobic, and more frequently multi-domain or ribosomal than the control proteins ( Figures 4 A, 4B, S5 B, and S5C).

The horizontal lines in the boxplots indicate the median; whisker caps and circles indicate the 10th–90th and 5th–95th percentiles, respectively.

The p value in (A) and (B) is based on the Mann-Whitney test, and the p value in (C) and (D) is based on a χ 2 test:;; ∗ p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01, and ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001.

The isoelectric point (pI) distribution of PS proteins is similar to that of the control set of all of the quantified proteins ( Tables S2 and S3 ). PS and thermo-sensitive proteins are overall less hydrophobic than the control set ( Figure 4 B), which is consistent with findings that proteins with an extensive hydrophobic core are more stable and less aggregation prone ( Walther et al., 2015 ).

To determine whether specific domain fold topologies are enriched in the PS proteome, we isolated the peptides generated by the thermolysin pulse through a filtration device and analyzed them by LC-MS/MS (see STAR Methods ). We identified 1,824 thermolysin peptides at NC and 678 thermolysin peptides at HS, and assigned them to 369 NC-PS proteins and 125 HS-TS proteins, respectively ( Tables S5 A and S5B). The cleavage peptides of thermo-sensitive (HS-TS) proteins are more hydrophobic than those generated from NC-PS proteins or from chemically denatured lysate proteins ( Figure S5 D; Table S1 A). This finding indicates that the unfolding induced by HS leads to the exposure of hydrophobic amino acids that are buried in the native state. We could assign 1,602 and 601 thermolysin cleavage peptides to known Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) fold domains for NC-PS and HS-TS proteins, respectively ( Gough et al., 2001 ). We found that ∼12% of NC-PS proteins (40 of 326 with known domain fold) and ∼15% of HS-TS proteins (17 of 113 proteins) contained at least one PS domain with SCOP fold c.37 (P loop nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases), compared to ∼8% in the control set (95 of 1,213 proteins) ( Figure 4 C). The domain fold c.37 is characterized by a complex α/β topology and is overrepresented (∼18% of total) in the set of strong DnaK interactors identified previously ( Calloni et al., 2012 ). Proteins with c.37 architecture are multifunctional and undergo conformational changes upon nucleotide binding and hydrolysis ( Caetano-Anollés et al., 2009 ). The c.37 domain is often part of the multi-domain and hetero-oligomeric proteins ( Calloni et al., 2012 ). c.37 domains in the context of multi-domain proteins are stabilized against thermal unfolding by KJE overexpression and are destabilized in ΔKJ cells ( Figure 4 D). In contrast, the SCOP fold a.4 (DNA or RNA binding 3-helical bundle) is underrepresented among TS proteins ( Figure 4 C), suggesting that this domain fold is generally rather thermo-stable. Note that the ribosomal proteins that are strongly stabilized by KJE ( Figure S3 E) belong to several SCOP folds, including b.40, b.34, d.58, and d.325. These proteins have a high degree of surface accessibility in the ribosome complex and represent a specific subset of thermo-sensitive proteins.

In summary, besides ribosomal proteins, the DnaK chaperone system conformationally stabilizes large multi-domain proteins with a preference for proteins containing c.37 domains. Proteins with such domains are frequently hetero-oligomeric. In contrast, the proteins that are destabilized by KJE are often monomeric, single-domain proteins.
The DnaK Chaperone System Stabilizes the Folded State of Thermo-sensitive Proteins

To understand at the structural level how the KJE system stabilizes proteins against stress-induced unfolding, we analyzed the PP-cleavage pattern of UvrA and FusA as examples of thermo-sensitive multi-domain proteins ( Figure 2 F). UvrA, a known DnaK interactor ( Calloni et al., 2012 ), is part of a hetero-oligomeric complex in which a UvrA dimer interacts with two molecules of UvrB. UvrA has two discontinuous c.37 domains and contains multiple predicted DnaK binding sites throughout the sequence ( Figure 5 A). At 37°C (NC), UvrA is largely stable ( Figure 2 F). Only ∼15% of molecules are cleaved upon PP at a single hydrophilic region at residues Thr703 and Glu713 ( Figure 5 A). Upon HS, the protein unfolds extensively (∼50% of molecules cleaved), exposing at least 10 hydrophobic cleavage sites that are inaccessible at 37°C ( Figure 5 A; Table S5 B). Overexpression of KJE before HS efficiently protects UvrA against cleavage at all of these sites ( Figure 5 A) and fully restores its stability (∼17% of molecules degraded) ( Figure 2 F). FusA (elongation factor G) is a 77-kDa protein consisting of 5 domains (SCOP folds c.37, b.34, d.58, d.14, and d.58), with most of the predicted DnaK binding sites located in the GTP-binding c.37 domain ( Figure 5 B). FusA is globally destabilized upon HS (60% cleaved) ( Figure 2 F), exposing 29 mostly hydrophobic thermolysin cleavage sites ( Figure 5 B). KJE overexpression is protective against cleavage at almost all of these sites.

Figure 5 . PP Analysis of Specific Thermo-sensitive Proteins

(A–C) Top: the PP-cleavage pattern of nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA (A), elongation factor G (FusA) (B), and septum site-determining protein MinD (C) are mapped to the amino acid sequences . The c.37 SCOP fold domains are in cyan and the other domains are in gray; the hydrophobicity profiles are shown. The predicted DnaK binding sites are indicated as vertical lines in orange. The regions of significant thermolysin cleavage are marked in red (see STAR Methods ). Bottom: the cleaved regions (red) are assigned to the protein structures of UvrA (PDB: 2R6F , a homolog from Bacillus stearothermophilus ), FusA (PDB: 3J0E ), and MinD (PDB:  3Q9L ). The protein domains are colored as at the top. In the case of UvrA and MinD, the cleavage pattern is displayed in only one subunit of the dimer; the opposite subunits are in green.

The high degree of stabilization against PP afforded by KJE did not result from the prevention of protein aggregation, as only ∼1.3% of UvrA and ∼0.3% of FusA were recovered in the insoluble fraction upon HS ( Table S2 E). Thus, the KJE system either shifted the equilibrium of these proteins to the folded native state or shielded hydrophobic regions exposed upon thermal unfolding. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed PP experiments in vitro using the thermo-labile model protein firefly luciferase (FLuc) ( Schröder et al., 1993 ). FLuc denatured upon incubation at 45°C and formed a stable complex with DnaK/DnaJ in the presence of ATP and the absence of GrpE. Chaperone binding prevented FLuc aggregation but rendered the protein highly sensitive to PP with thermolysin at multiple cleavage sites (measured at 25°C) ( Figure S6 ), ruling out a shielding effect. This observation indicates that ATP-dependent cycles of DnaK/DnaJ binding and release, mediated by GrpE, promote refolding even under otherwise denaturing conditions.

Next, we analyzed the PP-cleavage pattern of MinD, a homodimer of 29 kDa subunits, as an example of a protein that is destabilized by KJE ( Figure 5 C). MinD oscillates between cell poles and is deenriched in the midzone of the cell, thereby marking the midzone for cell division ( Wu et al., 2011 ). It consists of a single c.37 domain. In NC cells, MinD is largely protease stable, except for cleavage of the short amphipathic α-helix at the C terminus (residues 255–263) that inserts transiently into the membrane during cycling ( Wu et al., 2011 ; Figure 5 C). Upon HS, cleavage occurred throughout the sequence, including the dimer interface, which is indicative of a shift to an unfolded monomer and is consistent with the temperature dependence of function ( Touhami et al., 2006 ). Notably, KJE overexpression markedly destabilized MinD, even at NC, to an extent similar to HS ( Figure 5 C), suggesting that MinD is conformationally dynamic. Thus, the DnaK chaperone machinery can have opposing effects on protein stability, even for proteins with similar c.37 domain topologies.
Discussion

We have analyzed ∼1,500 of the ∼2,400 cytosolic proteins ( Kerner et al., 2005 ) of E. coli by PP and quantitative proteomics and characterized the effects of the DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone system (KJE) on proteome stability. We found ∼500 proteins (∼25% of total by mass) to be protease sensitive (PS) under NCs, indicating that conformationally dynamic proteins make up a large fraction of the cytosolic proteome ( Figure 6 A). These metastable proteins tend to be larger than average in size, with a high degree of connectivity in protein interaction networks. Upon acute HS not resulting in the upregulation of the major chaperone systems, an additional ∼200 proteins unfolded, exposing hydrophobic amino acid residues to the solvents that are buried in the native state. HS also resulted in a further destabilization of NC-PS proteins, increasing the fraction of cleaved proteins to ∼33% by mass ( Figure 6 B). The overexpression of KJE revealed the potential of this chaperone system to markedly stabilize numerous thermo-sensitive proteins, including ribosomal proteins and large, multi-domain, hetero-oligomeric proteins ( Figure 6 B). These results reveal a previously unknown capacity of Hsp70 to stabilize proteins in their folded states under denaturing stress conditions.

Properties of Thermo-sensitive Proteins Stabilized by KJE

The DnaK chaperone system had a profound effect on proteome stability by restoring the folding equilibrium of many thermo-sensitive proteins to a level comparable to that observable at normal temperature ( Figure 6 B). A large fraction of these stabilized proteins have previously been identified as DnaK interactors ( Calloni et al., 2012 ), as exemplified by UvrA and FusA. These KJE-stabilized proteins frequently contain c.37 domains, which are significantly enriched among thermo-sensitive proteins, and are typically multi-domain and part of the hetero-oligomeric complexes. c.37 is evolutionarily the most ancient and also one of the most abundant protein folds in E. coli , comprising many essential nucleotide-binding enzymes that are often part of the hetero-oligomeric complexes ( Ma et al., 2008 , McGuffin et al., 2004 ). The c.37 α/β topology is stabilized by extensive long-range interactions. Accordingly, such proteins tend to have complex folding pathways and are likely to populate kinetically trapped folding intermediates ( Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2004 ), during both folding and unfolding. These findings suggest that thermo-labile protein domains have co-evolved with the DnaK chaperone system to optimize (functionally relevant) structural dynamics, while avoiding global destabilization and loss of function under stress conditions.

Stabilization by KJE is also prominent for numerous essential ribosomal proteins, assigning an important ribosome-protective role to this chaperone system at an elevated temperature. Ribosomal proteins are overall highly positively charged, and it is tempting to speculate that the binding specificity of DnaK for short hydrophobic sequence elements that are flanked by basic amino acids ( Rüdiger et al., 1997 ) represents an adaptation to this highly conserved protein class. Such an adaptation could then have shaped the general mode of interaction of DnaK with client proteins.
Mechanistic Considerations

How does the DnaK system conformationally stabilize proteins under denaturing HS conditions? We demonstrated that the binding of DnaK to a thermally denatured model protein in vitro resulted in global destabilization and extensive cleavage upon PP, excluding a mechanism of protease protection by direct shielding of hydrophobic cleavage sites. We therefore conclude that the DnaK chaperone system actively promotes refolding or prevents unfolding, even under conditions in which the native state is thermodynamically unfavorable. The mechanism underlying this remarkable capacity remains to be explored, but our results are consistent with recent observations in vitro ( Goloubinoff et al., 2018 , Mashaghi et al., 2016 ), including the proposal that DnaK may not only bind unfolded proteins but also transiently interact with and stabilize near-native states ( Mashaghi et al., 2016 ). DnaK may also destabilize kinetically trapped (un)folding intermediates populated upon HS, thereby facilitating refolding and shifting the folding equilibrium toward the native state. Support for the notion that kinetically trapped folding intermediates accumulate upon HS comes from the fact that thermo-sensitive proteins do not readily refold upon the transfer of cells from 45°C to 37°C, the temperature of PP. We note that this putative mechanism of Hsp70 action provides both a target (i.e., exposed hydrophobic residues in the intermediate that are normally buried in the folded state) and efficiency, as intermediate states are much less populated than native states, and therefore there is a much lower chaperone requirement.
Destabilizing Effects of KJE

Our analysis revealed that elevated KJE levels, while being largely proteome protective, have a trade-off in destabilizing a minor group of proteins ( Figure 6 B). These proteins are generally smaller in size and often monomeric, and DnaK binding apparently shifts their folding equilibrium toward the unfolded state. We suggest that this mechanism may contribute to the adaptation of E. coli to stress conditions. A prominent example of this type of protein is heat shock regulator rpoH (σ 32 ) (∼31 kDa), in which destabilization by high levels of DnaK serves to attenuate the stress response ( Rodriguez et al., 2008 ). Another example is the cell division protein MinD , a thermo-labile protein that is markedly destabilized by elevated KJE levels, even at NC. The inhibition of MinD function causes minicell formation, which was proposed to facilitate the disposal of damaged proteins under stress conditions ( de Boer et al., 1989 , Rang et al., 2018 ), suggesting that destabilization by KJE may be physiologically relevant. As MinD consists of a single c.37 domain, these findings show that the chaperone machinery can have opposing effects on protein stability, even for proteins with similar c.37 domain topologies. Whether the chaperones shift the folding equilibrium toward the native state (UvrA, FusA) or are destabilizing (MinD) appears to depend on a complex interplay of factors, including intrinsic structural stability and folding properties, domain context (multi- or single-domain proteins), and the number and location of potential DnaK binding regions.

Overall, these findings reveal how the levels of DnaK (and of molecular chaperones in general) must be carefully controlled and adjusted to growth conditions to achieve the optimal balance between the opposing effects on protein stability.

Experimental Model and Subject Details

Experiments were carried out in E. coli strains MC4100, MC4100 Δ dnaKdnaJ ::Kan R (ΔKJ) ( Genevaux et al., 2004 ) and MC4100 dnaK-dnaJ-grpE ::Kan R Spc R (KJE overexpression) ( Castanié et al., 1997 ).
Method Details
SILAC Medium

M63 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose, 0.5 mM L-amino acid, and 1 mM MgSO 4 was used for SILAC labeling. To prepare light, medium and heavy media, the respective amino acids were added, for light: Arg0 and Lys0 (arginine and lysine, Sigma), for medium: Arg6 and Lys4 (13C6-L-arginine, Cambridge Isotope laboratories; 4.4′.5.5′-D4-L-lysine, Silantes) and for heavy: Arg10 and Lys8 (argine- 13 C 6 , 15 N 4 and lysine- 13 C 6 , 15 N 2 , Silantes).
Protein Purification

Mouse α-synuclein (α-Syn) (pSTS500 plasmid, WT), maltose binding protein MBP (ECB/pBA), DnaK and DnaJ were expressed in E. coli cells (strain BL21, DE3). For the purification of α-Syn and MBP, cells were grown in light and heavy isotope labeled medium at 37°C, respectively, while for purification of DnaK and DnaJ, cells were grown in LB medium. Induction was carried out at an OD 600nm of ∼0.5 with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 2 h. The purification of these recombinant proteins was performed as described previously ( Hoyer et al., 2002 , Langer et al., 1992 , Tang et al., 2006 ). The identity and purity of the isolated proteins was determined by LC-MS/MS. α-Syn and MBP were ∼98% pure based on intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ). Purified proteins were stored in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5% (v/v) glycerol at −80°C.
Cell Culture

E. coli cells (WT and Δ dnaKdnaJ ::Kan R strain) were grown to an OD 600nm of ∼1 under normal growth (NC) conditions at 37°C in 25 mL light (L) or heavy (H) SILAC medium. For expression of the dnaK-dnaJ-grpE chaperone machinery, induction was carried out with 250 μM IPTG when cells reached mid-exponential phase (OD 600nm ∼0.5). To isolate the insoluble fraction, E. coli cells were grown in 25 mL light (L), medium (M) or heavy (H) SILAC medium at 37°C. Cells were harvested at OD 600nm ∼1. Spheroplasts were prepared at 4°C as described previously ( Calloni et al., 2012 ), then resuspended in 150 μL SILAC medium supplemented with 0.25 M sucrose, 0.2% glycerol and recovered at physiological temperature (37°C) for 15 min. For pulse proteolysis (PP) under heat stress, spheroplasts were incubated at 45°C for 15 min. Immediately after incubation at 37°C or 45°C, H-labeled purified proteins (3.9 μg α-Syn and 4.2 μg MBP) were added into the suspension of H-labeled cells as a control for PP efficiency.
Cell Lysis and Pulse Proteolysis

Spheroplasts (H-labeled) prepared as above were lysed by dilution into 350 μL hypo-osmotic lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5 mM CaCl 2 and 5 mM MgCl 2 ) in the presence of ∼120 μg/mL thermolysin. To perform PP uniformly at 37°C, the temperature of the lysis buffer was 37°C for the normal growth condition (NC) and 34°C for the HS condition. Thermolysin treatment was terminated after 1 min by addition of 100 μL stop-solution (6x protease inhibitor and 150 mM EDTA). The L-labeled purified proteins (α-Syn and MBP) were added into the H-labeled cell lysate in an amount equivalent to that of the H-labeled purified proteins (added before PP) as control for PP efficiency. L-labeled cells were lysed under the same conditions but without thermolysin treatment and addition of purified proteins. After centrifugation at 16 000 g for 15 min, 15 μg of light and heavy isotope labeled soluble cell lysates (from normal and heat stress conditions) were mixed 1:1. All experiments were conducted three times independently.

For PP on firefly luciferase (FLuc) bound to DanK/DnaJ, purified FLuc (0.1 μM) was incubated in the presence of DnaK (3 μM) and DnaJ (1 μM) at 25°C or 45°C for 30 min in HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5mM ATP, 10 mM Mg(OAc) 2 ). Then, proteins were subjected to PP (1 min at 25°C). After the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA (final concentration 25 mM), the samples were processed as described for the PP workflow. Three independent experiments were performed.

To perform PP of purified DnaK, trypsin or thermolysin (∼120 μg/mL) was added to 3 μM DnaK in HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5mM ATP, 10 mM Mg(OAc) 2, ) at 37°C. After 1 min incubation, the reaction was blocked by adding PMSF (final concentration 5 mM) for trypsin or EDTA (25 mM) for thermolysin. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4%–12% Bis-Tris acrylamide NuPAGE gels in MOPS SDS running buffer (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue .

To measure changes in the total proteome composition upon heat stress (HS cells H-labeled versus NC cells L-labeled), upon DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE overexpression (KJE cells L-labeled versus control cells H-labeled) or upon DnaK/DnaJ deletion (ΔKJ cells H-labeled versus NC cells L-labeled), spheroplasts were prepared as above and lysed in hypo-osmotic buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% Triton and 6xEDTA free protease inhibitor). After centrifugation at 2,000 g for 15 min, 50 μg of L- and H-labeled cell lysates were mixed 1:1. All experiments were conducted three times independently.

To measure changes in the total proteome composition upon prolonged heat stress, L-labeled intact cells were incubated at 45°C for 3 h while control cells (H-labeled) were grown at 37°C. These cells were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 2,000 g for 15 min, 50 μg of L- and H-labeled cell lysates were mixed 1:1. Experiments were conducted two times independently.
Sucrose Density Gradient

Spheroplasts were prepared from WT cells grown at 37°C, as described above, and incubated at 15 min at 37°C (NC) or 15 min at 45°C (HS). Spheroplasts were lysed in hypo-osmotic lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5% triton, 1x complete protease inhibitor EDTA-free, 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM chloramphenicol). RNA concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop UV spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher). Equivalent amounts of RNA were layered onto a linear sucrose gradient (10 to 40% sucrose (w/v), 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM chloramphenicol in nuclease-free water) and centrifuged in a SW41 rotor for 2 h at 36,000 rpm at 4°C. The gradient profile (absorbance at 254 nm) was analyzed using a piston gradient fractionator coupled to a spectrophotometer (BioComp).
Isolation of Protein Aggregates Under Normal Growth and Heat Stress Conditions

To isolate insoluble proteins, the spheroplasts prepared above were resuspended in 150 μL SILAC medium supplemented with 0.25 M sucrose, 0.2% glycerol and recovered at physiological temperature (37°C) for 15 min. The L- and H-labeled cells were further incubated at 45°C for 15 min. Cells were then lysed in hypo-osmotic buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% Triton and 6xEDTA free protease inhibitor). After centrifugation at 2,000 g for 15 min, 1.0 mg M- and H-labeled cell lysates were mixed at a 1:1 ratio (1.0 mg total protein each) and centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. The pellet was further processed for isolation of aggregated proteins as previously described ( Tomoyasu et al., 2001 ). Briefly, the pellet was frozen and resuspended in 400 μL buffer A (10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 1 mM EDTA) by brief sonication. After centrifugation at 20, 000 x g for 30 min at 4°C, pellet fractions were again resuspended in 320 μL buffer A by brief sonication; afterward, 80 μL of 10% (v/v) NP40 was added. The NP40 insoluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 20, 000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. This washing step was repeated twice. The insoluble fraction was finally washed with 400 μL buffer A and resuspended in 100 μL buffer A. 20 μg of L-labeled cell lysate was spiked into the insoluble fraction prior to analysis by mass spectrometry .
Analysis of Thermolysin Cleaved Peptides

The thermolysin-cleaved peptides from PP treated samples (H-labeled cell culture, 100 μg) were mixed with urea (final concentration 6 M) and separated from the intact proteins in the soluble cell lysate using a filter device (Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL, Merck Millipore Ltd.) with 10 kDa cut-off at 14,000 g for 30 min. 200 μl of 8M urea was added into the filter device. After centrifugation at 14,000 g for 30 min, the filter units were washed with 200 μl of 50 mM HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 min. This washing step was repeated twice. Filtrates were combined and fractionated with strong cation exchange (SCX) tips ( Rappsilber et al., 2007 ). SCX StageTips were prepared by stacking 5 plugs of Empore SCX disks (Sigma-Aldrich) into a 200 μL micropipette tip as described ( Rappsilber et al., 2007 ). Sample and washing solutions were applied to the StageTips using a centrifuge at 3,600 rpm. StageTips were consecutively washed with 100 μl of acetonitrile (ACN), and twice with 100 μl of 1% TFA. Samples were then loaded onto the StageTips and the flow-through re-loaded onto the same StageTip for another binding step. StageTips were then washed 3-times with 100 μl of 0.2% TFA. Peptides were fractionated by consecutive elution steps from SCX disks with 80 μl of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM ammonium acetate containing 20% ACN and 0.5% formic acid and a final elution step with 100 μl of 5% ammonium hydroxide/80% ACN. The elutates were dried in a vacuum centrifuge concentrator and further desalted using C18 StageTips ( Rappsilber et al., 2007 ). C18 StageTips were prepared by stacking three punch-outs of C18 Empore Disks (Sigma-Aldrich) into a 200 μl micropipette tip. The C18 StageTips were washed with 20 μl of ACN and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm. This washing step was repeated twice. The C18 StageTips were then washed with 20 μl of 0.1% TFA and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm. This washing step was repeated 3-times. The samples were then loaded onto the C18 StageTips and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm. The flow-through was again loaded onto the same C18 StageTip and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm. The C18 StageTips were washed with 20 μl of 0.1% TFA and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm. This washing step was repeated twice. Peptides were eluted from the StageTips with 40 μl of 0.1% formic acid/80% ACN by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm and dried in a vacuum centrifuge concentrator.
SDS-PAGE and In-gel Digestion with Trypsin

Protein mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4%–12% Bis-Tris acrylamide NuPAGE gels in MOPS SDS running buffer (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. After destaining, entire gel lanes were cut into 12 (mixed cell lysates) or 4 (FLuc) slices of equal size followed by in-gel digestion. Briefly, the 12 gel slices were further cut into ∼1 mm 3 cubes using a scalpel . After washing with 1 mL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), gel pieces were dehydrated with 1 mL ACN. After removing and discarding the supernatant, gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge concentrator for 3 min. Dehydrated gel pieces were reduced with 100 μL of 10 mM dithiothreitol in 50 mM ABC for 45 min at 56°C, and then alkylated with 100 μL of 55 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ABC for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. After washing with 1 mL 50 mM ABC and dehydration with ACN (1 mL), gel pieces were rehydrated in 100 μL of 50 mM ABC solution containing 15 ng/μL trypsin (sequencing grade, modified, Roche) and incubated overnight at 37°C. Peptides were extracted from gel pieces once with 750 μL of 5% formic acid/30% ACN and once with 300 μL ACN. After drying in a vacuum centrifuge concentrator, the samples were dissolved in 20 μl of 0.1% TFA and desalted with C18 StageTips as described above.
Sample Preparation for Analysis of Total Proteome and Protein Aggregates

To determine abundance fold-changes of selected protein groups (see Tables S2D , S3A , and S4 C) and for the analysis of protein aggregates (see Table S2 E), the Filter Aided Sample Pre (FASP) method was used to generate peptides for LC-MS/MS analysis ( Wiśniewski et al., 2009 ). Briefly, cell lysates or aggregate fractions prepared as above were mixed with 200 μl of UA buffer (8.0 M urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) in a filter unit (Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL, Merck Millipore Ltd.) with 10 kDa cut-off and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 15 min at room temperature. The concentrates were diluted in the filter units with 200 μl of UA buffer and centrifuged again. The concentrates were incubated with 200 μl of 20 mM DTT at room temperature for 45 min. After centrifugation as above, the concentrates were alkylated in the dark for 30 min by adding 200 μl of 50 mM iodoacetamide in UA buffer. After centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 15 min, the filter units were washed with 200 μl of UA buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 15 min. This washing step was repeated twice. The filter units were then washed with 200 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 15 min. This washing step was again repeated twice. Proteins in the filter units were digested overnight in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 containing 15 ng/μL trypsin. After incubation in a wet chamber at 37°C overnight, the digested peptides were collected in new tubes by centrifugation of the filter units at 14,000 x g for 10 min. 50 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl was added in the filter units and centrifuged again. The flow-through fractions were combined and acidified with 25% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final TFA concentration of 0.1%. Tryptic peptides generated from protein aggregates were further fractionated by SCX as described above. The samples were desalted using C18 StageTips as described above, dried and resuspended in 10 μl of 5% formic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis.
Mass Spectrometry

The digested peptides were dissolved in 10 μL of 5.0% formic acid. Mass spectrometry was performed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer with a nanospray ion source and a nanoHPLC Proxeon EASY-nLC 1000 system (Thermo, San Jose, CA, USA). Reversed-phase separation was accomplished using a C18 AQ phase (1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch) packed silica capillary (75 μm i.d. × 250 mm length). 0.1% formic acid in H 2 O was used as the mobile phase A, and 0.1% formic acid in ACN was used as the mobile phase B. About 3 μL of peptide solution was loaded onto the C18 packed capillary column and separated with a linear gradient from 5 to 35% buffer B in 120 min at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The Q-Exactive was operated in data-dependent mode with survey scans acquired at a mass range from 300 to 1750 m/z and a resolution setting of 70,000 (FWHM). Up to ten of the most abundant ions from the survey scan were selected and fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 17,500 (FWHM), maximum injection time of 120 ms, precursor isolation width of 2 Da, and a target value of 2e 5 .
Database Search

The acquired mass spectrometric raw data were processed using MaxQuant version 1.5.0.25 ( https://www.maxquant.org/ ). MS/MS spectra were searched against E. coli K12 proteins in UniProt (version 2011-03-02). As search parameters, trypsin allowing for cleavage N-terminal to proline was chosen as enzyme specificity ; Arg6, Lys4 were selected for medium-labels and Arg10, Lys8 for heavy labels; cysteine carbamidomethyl (C) was set as fixed modifications, while protein N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were selected as variable modifications. A maximum of two missed cleavages and three labels were allowed. For direct identification of thermolysin-degraded peptides, mass spectrometric raw files were searched with the following parameters: Non-specific enzyme restriction and cysteine carbamidomethyl (C) were set as fixed modifications, while protein N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation and heavy SILAC labeled arginine or lysine (+10 Da or +8 Da) were selected as variable modifications. In addition, semi-thermolysin-semi-tryptic peptides from in-gel digested gel slices were identified with the same parameters, except that fully tryptic peptides were excluded. Proteins and peptides (minimal seven amino acids) were identified at a false discovery rate of 1% using a target-decoy approach with a reversed database. The “re-quantify” option was enabled for protein quantification. The cleaved fraction of firefly luciferase by PP was quantified by the label free algorithm in MaxQuant.
Cutoff Control Experiment

In order to determine an appropriate cutoff value for significantly degraded proteins, we performed a control experiment in triplicate. Light and heavy labeled samples were both submitted to heat stress and were treated by pulse proteolysis under identical conditions. Then, samples were mixed and analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described above. Less than 1% of proteins had H/L ratios below 0.61 in 2 out of 3 of the control experiments. Thus, a H/L ratio of < 0.61 (> 39% of a specific protein degraded) in the PP-SILAC experiment would indicate that a protein is protease-sensitive with a statistical significance of p < 0.01.

Protein synthesis in exponentially growing E. coli (doubling time ∼30 min) occurs at a rate of ∼20 amino acids per second ( Balchin et al., 2016 ). This means that an average E. coli protein of 310 amino acids takes about ∼15 s for synthesis. We can calculate that the steady state concentration of newly synthesized (presumably not yet folded) protein is ∼0.8% of total. This would likely be less in spheroplasts. The sensitivity of the PP-SILAC is such that > 39% of a protein must be degraded for that protein to be classified as protease-sensitive. Thus, our data reflect the conformational property of preexistent proteins.
Data Processing

Unless stated otherwise, protein SILAC ratios were determined from the gel-slices in which the protein was identified in highest abundance in the SILAC state without pulse proteolysis (full-length protein). Outer membrane proteins and periplasmic proteins were excluded from further analysis, because these proteins were removed during the preparation of spheroplast. Combined intensity ratios of peptides were calculated by dividing the summed intensities of heavy isotope labeled peptides from the entire gel by the summed intensities of corresponding light isotope labeled peptides. Proteins with a SILAC ratio of < 0.61 under normal condition were defined as protease-sensitive (PS). Thermo-sensitive (TS) proteins were considered as the proteins with a SILAC ratio < 0.61 that were significantly destabilized under heat stress compared to normal conditions as determined using a Student’s t test in the Perseus software v.1.5.0.9 ( Tyanova et al., 2016 ) at FDR of 0.05; the s0 value used in the global score calculation was 0.5 corresponding to a minimal fold-change of 1.5. Proteins stabilized or destabilized in KJE and ΔKJ cells were defined in the same way as described for TS proteins in WT. SILAC ratios of tryptic peptides under NC and HS conditions were also compared using Student’s t test in the Perseus software at FDR of 0.05, the s0 value used in the global score calculation was 0.1. If both, the combined (entire gel) intensity and SILAC ratio of a specific tryptic peptide was lower than 0.61, then the overlapping thermolysin-degraded peptide was considered as cleavage region and used for assignment of protease-sensitive protein structures. The cleaved fraction of each protein was calculated as 1 – SILAC ratio (full-length protein). Degraded fractions of PS proteins mass was calculated: ∑ { ( 1 − S I L A C r a t i o ) × i B A Q ( P S ) × M w } / ∑ ( i B A Q × M w ) The amount of mass aggregates upon heat stress was calculated: ∑ { ( i B A Q ( H ) − i B A Q ( M ) ) × M w } × 100 / ∑ ( i B A Q ( L ) × M w × 50 ) The insoluble fraction of each protein upon heat stress was calculated: { i B A Q ( H ) − i B A Q ( M ) } × 100 / ( i B A Q ( L ) × 50 )
Quantification and Statistical Analysis
Bioinformatic Analysis

Protein fold assignment was performed using SUPERFAMILY ( http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/downloads.html ) according to the SCOP: Structural Classification of Proteins and ASTRAL. Release 1.75 classification ( https://scop.berkeley.edu/astral/ver=1.75 ). Protein subcellular location, average hydropathy (GRAVY) of protein and peptide sequences and theoretical isoelectric points (pI) and potential DnaK binding sites were determined as described previously ( Calloni et al., 2012 ). Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis was performed relative to all quantified proteins using the DAVID algorithm ( Huang et al., 2009 ). A Benjamini-corrected modified Fisher’s exact test was performed to examine the significance of gene-term enrichment ( p value < 0.05). Protein-protein interaction network data of E. coli was analyzed as published ( Wuchty and Uetz, 2014 ).

Mann-Whitney (boxplot) and chi-square χ 2 statistical significance tests (bar graphs) were performed in R ( www.r-project.org ). p  value estimations for protease sensitivities in wild-type cells are based on control cutoff experiments (see “ Cutoff control experiment ”), whereas median p values for destabilized and stabilized proteins in KJE cells were calculated by Student’s t test in Perseus v.1.5.0.9 ( Tyanova et al., 2016 ).
