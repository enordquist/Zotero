medium decreases.22 Since the effective dielectric constant of
the micellar surface is lower than that of water,1"3 this could be a contributing factor for the moderate increase in the apparent reactivity of micelle-bound thiosulfate.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the combined studies of thiosulfate binding to CTAB micelles and of the effect of CTA2T micelles on the kinetics of reaction 1 can lead to the prediction of the effect of CTAB on the kinetics of this reaction. This implies that the reactivity of thiosulfate is identical in CTA2T

and CTAB micelles. We also have shown that the ion-exchange formalism is adequate to describe quantitatively the effect of detergents on reactions of divalent ions.

Abstract: A new approach to the interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments on macromolecules in solution is presented. This paper deals with the theoretical foundations and establishes the range of validity of this approach, and the accompanying paper demonstrates how a wide variety of experimental relaxation data can be successfully analyzed by using this approach. For both isotropic and anisotropic overall motion, it is shown that the unique information on fast internal motions contained in relaxation experiments can be completely specified by two model-independent quantities: (1) a generalized order parameter, £, which is a measure of the spatial restriction of the motion, and (2) an effective correlation time, re, which is a measure of the rate of motion. A simple expression for the spectral density involving these two parameters
is derived and is shown to be exact when the internal (but not overall) motions are in the extreme narrowing limit. The model-free approach (so called because < 2 and re have model-independent significance) consists of using the above spectral density to least-squares fit relaxation data by treating &2 and r6 as adjustable parameters. The range of validity of this approach is illustrated by analyzing error-free relaxation data generated by using sophisticated dynamical models. Empirical rules are presented that allow one to estimate the accuracy of &2 and re extracted by using the model-free approach by considering their numerical values, the resonance frequencies, and the parameters for the overall motion. For fast internal motions, it is unnecessary to use approaches based on complicated spectral densities derived within the framework of a model because all models that can give the correct value of £2 work equally well. The unique dynamic information (<f and re) can be easily extracted by using the model-free approach. Moreover, if one desires a physical picture of the motion, the numerical values of cP2 and re can be readily interpreted within a physically reasonable model.

I. Introduction
Nuclear magnetic relaxation data on macromolecules in solution contain information concerning the nature of internal motions that occur in these systems. The usual approach1 to extracting such information involves the use of dynamical models that are based on physical intuition and/or the ease of formulation. While such
analyses can be useful, there is the danger of overinterpretation of limited data and the possibility that the resulting physical picture is not unique. Models cannot be proven; they can only be elim-
inated. In this paper we seek to answer the questions: (1) what is the
unique information content of a given set of relaxation data and (2) how can one extract that information? In order to clarify the nature of the problem, let us consider a hypothetical example of a 13C NMR relaxation study of a lysine side chain in an isotropically reorienting protein. The relaxation of each carbon nucleus is determined by the fluctuations of the 13C-H vectors with respect to the external magnetic field. The observed quantities are determined by the Fourier transform (the spectral density)

of an appropriate time-correlation function evaluated at certain frequencies whose values depend on the external field strength. To obtain the time dependence of the correlation function, which contains all the potentially available dynamic information, one would, in principle, need to perform experiments at an infinite number of magnetic field strengths. Even then the dynamic information would be limited because of the nature of the correlation function. With current NMR technology, a typical data set consists of a few numbers (say, 7j’s and NOE’s at two magnetic fields). As a result of steric constraints and concerted motions, the dynamics of a side chain are extremely complicated, and one cannot expect to construct a detailed picture of the dynamics from a few experimentally accessible numbers that, as we shall see, may contain redundant information.
The simplest possible description of the internal dynamics of the side chain involves specifying (1) the rate (time scale) and (2) the spatial restriction of the motion of each carbon in the chain. Suppose we sit in a frame rigidly attached to the macromolecule

and observe the reorientation of the 13C-H vector associated with,
say, the Cr carbon. Because of intrachain and interchain steric interactions, this vector will not assume all possible orientations. That is, its motion is not isotropic but is restricted. The motion of other carbons in the chain may be more or less restricted. The time course of the trajectory of a 13C-H vector as it explores the positions accessible to it is complicated. The rate of motion of this 13C-H vector cannot be described by a single parameter (i.e., the correlation function is not a single exponential). However, different vectors in general do move at different “speeds” (i.e., the time dependence of their correlation functions differ), and it is desirable to define a correlation time that describes the rate
of motion in an effective way. In this paper we shall show that the information on fast internal
motions (i.e., faster than about 0.3 ns) contained in an NMR relaxation experiment at currently available fields can be completely described by (1) a generalized order parameter, §, which is the measure of the degree of spatial restriction of the motion, and (2) an effective correlation time, re, which is a measure of the rate of the motion. The generalized order parameter and the effective correlation time will explicitly be defined in a modelindependent way. For the special case that the overall motion can be described by a single correlation time tm, our approach to extracting the unique information (i.e., S and re) is based on the following simple expression for the spectral density:

^2rM

\ (1 - S2)t

(

( 1 + )2
„

( 1 + )2/

(1)

™1 = ™’ + Tf1

(2)

which we shall derive. Specifically, we propose to least-squares fit the experimental relaxation parameters to those calculated by using the above expression, treating S2 and tc as the only adjustable parameters. We refer to this approach as “model-free” because eq 1 is derived without invoking a specific model for internal motions and because S and r5 are defined in a model-
independent way. Once numerical values of S and t„ are extracted from the data, then one can consider their interpretation within the framework of a particular model. This is to be contrasted with the usual approach in which the spectral density is evaluated within the framework of a model.
The above procedure is clearly very simple to apply. The question is whether it works. The answer involves two separate issues. First, can the above two-parameter expressions reproduce the data, and second, are the resulting parameters meaningful (i.e., do S and re obtained by least-squares fitting the relaxation data agree with their exact values)? The strategy we have adopted in order to answer these questions is based on the analysis of “experimental” data that were generated by using a variety of sophisticated models of the internal dynamics (i.e., by using complicated spectral densities). The data generated in this way are error free, and S and re are known exactly. Thus, both of the questions raised above can be answered unambiguously. By analyzing a large number of sets of simulated data, we have established the range of validity and the accuracy of our approach. Basically, we have found that the data can always be reproduced. S and Te are virtually exact when the internal motions (but not the overall motion) are close to the extreme narrowing limit; they are reasonably accurate (~25%) as long as 6 < 0.5 and S2 > 0.01. More precise criteria will be presented later in this paper. In the accompanying paper, we shall consider the application of our approach to actual experimental results.
The spectral density in eq 1 has the same functional form as an approximate spectral density derived by several authors2™6

within the framework of the diffusion in a cone model. In this
model, the interaction vector is assumed to diffuse freely, with a wobbling diffusion constant Dv in a cone of semiangle 0. A major point of this paper is that eq 1 is more general than the diffusion in a cone model and is applicable to physical situations where this model is not reasonable. Stated another way, our model-free approach to analyzing experimental data (in the special case that the overall motion is isotropic) is operationally the same as using the diffusion in the cone model. However, the parameters S and tc that are extracted from the data have a more general significance and need not be interpreted within the framework of this model. Our approach is also formally similar to the work of Jardetzky and co-workers7™9 (i.e., the spectral density is represented by a few Lorentzians with adjustable parameters). However, as will become apparent, the theoretical justification for using such an approach and, more importantly, the interpretation of the resulting parameters are different.
The outline of this paper is as follows. In section II we describe the theoretical basis of our model-free approach to analyzing relaxation data. We first consider the case that the overall motion
is isotropic; the anisotropic case is treated subsequently. We consider the general expression for the correlation function for
internal motions (Cft)) that describes dipolar relaxation and also
quadrupolar and chemical shift anisotropy relaxation in the special case that the relevant tensors are axially symmetric. We analyze the behavior of this correlation function at short and long times. We express the infinite-time limit in terms of the generalized order parameter, S, which is a model-independent measure of the degree
of spatial restriction of the motion. We introduce a single-ex-
ponential approximation to Cft) that is exact at t = 0 and t =
°° and has the exact area. We then show that the spectral density obtained from the total correlation function constructed by using
this approximation for Cft) is in fact exact when the internal
motions are sufficiently fast (i.e., they are in the extreme narrowing
limit). We show how the development can be generalized to incorporate fluctuations in the internuclear distance. Finally, we
consider anisotropic overall motion and conclude this section by making contact with approaches that are operationally similar
to ours. In section III, we establish the range of validity of our
model-free approach by analyzing a large number of simulated “experimental” data sets that were generated by using a variety of sophisticated dynamical models. Empirical rules are presented that can be used to determine whether the generalized order parameters and effective correlation times extracted from the data
are meaningful.
II. Theory
The relaxation due to dipole-dipole interaction between two nuclei can be described by the correlation function10,11

where )„„(2)( ) is a Wigner rotation matrix element12 and the
Euler angles, , specify the orientation of the unit vector, pLF,
connecting the two nuclei in the laboratory coordinate system. This correlation function also describes quadrupolar and chemical shift anisotropy relaxation in the special case where the relevant tensors are axially symmetric. For a system in solution, the correlation function does not depend on the index q and can be rewritten by using the addition theorem for spherical harmonics12
as

m = ys(P2(pLF(oyaLF(t)))

A. Isotropic Overall Motion We consider a macromolecule whose overall motion can be described by a single correlation time.
In subsection B, we shall consider anisotropic overall motions. For the isotropic case, when it is assumed that the overall and internal motions are independent, the total correlation function can be rigorously factored as

C(t) = C0(r)C,(r)

(10)

where the correlation function for overall motion is

c0(t) = y5e-6D«· = iv~,/TM

(ID

where Z)M and rM are the rotational diffusion constant and cor-
relation time of the macromolecule, respectively. The correlation function for internal motions is

CM = ( 2(µ( 0)·µ(0))

(12)

where the unit vector µ describes the orientation of the interaction vector in a reference frame that is rigidly attached to the macromolecule.
The Internal Correlation Function. We now consider the properties of the correlation function that describes internal motions. Let us consider the relaxation of a carbon in some side
chain in a protein (see Figure 1). The motion of the 13C-H vector of this carbon in the macromolecular frame is, in general, complicated. If the motion is Markovian (e.g., diffusive or jumplike),
then CM can be expressed as a series of exponentials

CM = «V"

where r0 = =°, , > 2 > r3..., and 0 < a¡ < 1 for all i. The length of this expansion and the magnitudes of the amplitudes, a¡, and the correlation times, ,·, depend on the precise nature of the motion. For example, if µ diffuses freely about an axis (the Woessner model14), the above expansion contains three terms. If the motion of µ is restricted about this axis, then the sum contains
an infinite number of terms.11,15 If µ can jump between N discrete sites, the expansion contains N terms.
Although the precise form of eq 13 depends on a model, we can obtain a number of properties of the internal correlation function independent of a particular model. The simplest is its value at t = 0,

c,(0) = ( 2{µ( 0).µ(0))) = 1

(14)

Now let us consider the value of C¡(t) at long times. We will see
that Ci(“) is a rigorous model-independent measure of the degree
of spatial restriction of the internal motion. By using the property of correlation functions that

i is a model-independent measure of the degree of spatial restriction of the motion. It satisfies the inequalities 0 < <P2 < 1. If the internal motion is isotropic (i.e., all orientations of µ are equally probable, Peq(fi) = (4ir)"‘), then

0 <P =

(20)

However, the converse is not true (see below). On the other hand,

,( ) if the motion is completely restricted (i.e.,

then

In the special case that the motion is azimuthally symmetric about

/^( ) an axis (i.e.,

= pfifi), independent of , where is the angle

between µ and the symmetry axis), then

$ = (P2(cos 0)) = S

(22)

i.e., the generalized order parameter simply becomes the usual order parameter.
The order parameter S (and hence <P) can vanish even if the
motion is not isotropic. For example, consider Woessner’s model,
which describes the free diffusion of µ about a fixed axis. If ß
is the angle between µ and this symmetry axis, then

^Woessner = ^(cos ß)

(23)

since «)( ) = (2tt sin 0)~' (0 - ß). The order parameter for a
model in which µ jumps among three discrete equivalent sites about the symmetry axis is also given by eq 23. We note that the order parameter vanishes when ß is at the “magic” angle (54.7°). A similar situation arises for the diffusion in the cone model where

the order parameter (see eq A3) vanishes not only when 0O = ir

/2 but also when 0O =

(i.e., when the interaction vector is re-

stricted to move in a hemisphere). The generalized order pa-

rameter can easily be evaluated for a variety of models (see the

Appendix for some examples).

We are now in a position to propose an approximation to the

internal correlation function that plays a central role in our de-

velopment. Figure 2 shows schematically the behavior of C,(t)

as a function of time. The simplest approximation to C¡(í) which

is exact at t = 0 and at t = °° has the form

C,A(z) = ^2 + (1 -

(24)

where re is an effective correlation time. To determine re, one must place an additional requirement on the approximate correlation function. There exist several possibilities.17 For the diffusion in the cone model, in which Cj(r) is exactly given by an infinite sum of exponentials, it is known4,19 that, as long as j12 (Scone2) is not too small, the single exponential approximation is

very good if re is determined by requiring the area of QA(i) to be exact. Because of this and for reasons that will become apparent later, we choose re so that

<^2) dr = vof”(C,(r) -

(25)

or

,( - j32) = f"(C,(r) - $2) dr

(26)

In the special case that Q(r) = e"'/T (j3 = 0), it follows from eq 26 that = re. Thus, eq 26 can be regarded as the definition of an effective correlation time for an arbitrary correlation function. For future reference, we note that if expansion 13 is used for Q(r) {a0 = j32 since r0 = =°), the effective correlation time becomes

, ,. ß(1 - ^2) =

(27)

,= 1

We have seen that the generalized order parameter can be expressed as an equilibrium average and contains no information about the time scale of dynamics; it is solely a measure of the spatial restriction of the motion. The effective correlation time, on the other hand, depends both on the microscopic diffusion or jump constants and the spatial nature of the motion. For example, for the Woessner model14 in which the interaction vector diffuses
freely about a symmetry axis with diffusion coefficient D,

.(1 - ^(cos ß)2) =

3Z)~'(sin2 /3)(cos2 ß + yi6(sin2 ß)) (28)

where ß is the angle between µ and the symmetry axis. This property of re considerably complicates the interpretation of re. In particular, while <£ has a model-independent significance, re can be related to microscopic rate (diffusion) constants only within the framework of a particular model.
It is important to note that the above approximation for C,(Z) is not equivalent to truncating the exact series expansion (eq 13) after two terms, i.e.,

C,A(r) * a0 + ,ß-'/ '

(29)

Rather, the above approximation is the simplest form of a time-dependent Fade approximant. The area of the correlation function can be regarded as a moment of this function, and using the theory of moments, one can construct successively better approximations. For example, if in addition to Cj(0), C|(°°), and the area one also knows the behavior of Cj(r) at short times (i.e.,
(dC](r)/dr),=0) and /0“dz r(C:(r) - cS32), one can construct the two-exponential approximation of the form

C,A(r) = A + Be'0 + De~Et

(30)

We shall not pursue such an extension here since, as we shall see, the simplest version of this scheme (i.e., eq 24) is adequate for our purposes.
The Spectral Density. A combination of eq 11 and 24 gives the total correlation function as

(33)

and the corresponding spectral density as

( \5 1 + )2 1 + ( )2 /

(34)

As discussed in the Introduction, eq 34 plays a central role in our approach to analyzing experimental data.
We now examine some limiting cases of the above spectral density. If the overall motion is considerably slower than the
internal motions ( 6 « ), eq 34 simplifies to

5 V + ( )2 1 + ( ,)2 /

(35)

Furthermore, if , is sufficiently fast and the internal motion is in the extreme narrowing limit (( , )2 « 1, where is the largest frequency at which the spectral density must be evaluated, i.e., “c + for 13C NMR and 2 0 for 2H NMR), we have

l( «P2tm

\

(36>

Note that we have not assumed that the overall motion is in the extreme narrowing limit. By using the spectral density 36 in eq 7a and 7b, we find that 7, and 72 for dipolar relaxation are

7f1 = =P2(7,-')0 + ft27c2VrCH-6(l " ^2)re (37)

where (7()0, / = 1,2, are the relaxation times for an isotropically reorienting (with correlation time tm) macromolecule. The analogous expression for the NOE is
27f‘(NOE- 1)7c7h-‘ =
2«P2(7f1)0(NOE0 - 1)7c7h_1 + A27c27hW6(1 -
(38)

The second term in eq 37 and 38 arises exclusively from internal motions. However, the contribution due to the overall motion is reduced by the square of the generalized order parameter resulting from internal motions.
Although we have derived the spectral density in eq 36 by using our single exponential approximation to CK?) (eq 24), we shall now show that this expression for the spectral density, and hence eq 37 and 38 for the relaxation times and the NOE, are actually exact when (1) the overall motion is isotropic, (2) internal motions are much faster than the overall motion and lie in the extreme
narrowing limit, and (3) , is defined as the area of the correlation function (eq 26). This is an important result. It explains why our model-free approach to analyzing relaxation data works so well in many cases of interest.
To show this, we begin by noting that eq 13 for the internal correlation function can be rewritten as (since e?2 = a0)

CKO = « 2 + ,ß-'/ ,

(42)

which is indeed identical with eq 36 when , is defined via the area criterion (see eq 27). The above result is actually more

general than this derivation might suggest. A proof can be easily constructed for an arbitrary internal correlation function (not necessarily of the form given in eq 39) as long as the three conditions stated above hold.

In the above development, we have assumed that all the internal

motions are faster than the overall motion (i.e., , « for all

where j1'2 = <P2 + ax. eP/2 is an order parameter that is a measure of the degree of restriction on a time scale determined by the overall motion; that is, oP/2 is the limiting value of the internal correlation function for times less than tm. The internal correlation function can of course decay further for longer times, but the NMR experiment contains no information about such behavior. The situation when one of the components of the internal correlation function is neither in the extreme narrowing limit nor much slower than tm is more complicated, and the model-free approach based on eq 1 is not strictly applicable. However, by using the spectral density in eq 1 in such a case, we expected to obtain an effective order parameter with a value somewhere between <P2 and S’2.
Equation 42' shows that the model-free approach is also exact when the internal motions fall into two distinct time scales: (1) some much slower than the overall motion and (2) the remaining so much faster that they are in the extreme narrowing limit. When such separation of time scales occurs, the generalized order parameter extracted from the relaxation data is a measure of the
restriction of the internal motion on a time scale faster than the
overall motion. Since eq 42 and 42' are formally identical, one cannot distinguish between j12 and of'2, and the prime can be dropped if it is remembered that the generalized order parameters extracted from NMR relaxation data do not contain any information about motions slower than the overall motion.
In summary, when the internal motions are sufficiently fast, the NMR experiment only measures the asymptote (i.e., j12) of the internal correlation function for times shorter than the overall
motion and the corresponding area (i.e., tc) and contains no information about the details of its time dependence. Since the unique information content of an NMR experiment concerning fast internal motions is contained in $2 and t„, one can eliminate all physical models that cannot reproduce the numerical values of these parameters (e.g., in certain models such as those of Woessner14 and Wallach10 the order parameter is fixed by the geometry of the side chain). Conversely, all dynamical models that have the flexibility to reproduce the numerical values of <f2 and tc can describe the relaxation data equally well even though the physical pictures of the motion inherent in such models differ. For example, we have shown18 that multinuclear NMR relaxation experiments on nucleic acid fragments could be described equally well by using different (two-site jump and diffusion in a cone) models of the internal motion. These models correspond to different physical pictures, but their parameters that reproduce the data yield the same numerical value of the order parameter.
The Effective 13C-H Intemuclear Distance. Before generalizing the development to treat anisotropic overall motions, we consider
the limit that the internal motions are infinitely fast (tc — 0). We will show that the influence of the generalized order parameter in the expressions for 13C NMR dipolar relaxation times can be mimicked by using an effective carbon-hydrogen intemuclear distance. In the limit that tc -* 0, the spectral density (eq 34)

where (7))0 is the result for an isotropically reorienting sphere. We note that this equation can formally be rewritten as

7, = (7Y)0

(45)

where (T/)0 is the sphere result calculated by using an effective
internuclear distance, rCH', given by eq 46. Since 0 < |<£| < 1,

rcu = rchI^I '^3

(46)

the effective internuclear distance, rCH', is always larger than rCH.
For example, if rCH is 1.09 Á and is estimated by using the diffusion in the cone model (eq A3) with a cone angle (0O) equal to 16°, then rcii' = 1.11 Á. It is important to note that bending vibrations (librations) lead to values of & smaller than unity and,
hence, increase the effective internuclear distance. Stretching vibrations in the harmonic approximation result in a decrease in the effective internuclear distance. Thus, the observation of
Dill and Allerhand20 that the NMR data at two magnetic fields
for the a carbons of lysozyme can be fitted with a single correlation
time when rcii' = 1.11 Á is likely to be an indication of the
presence of librational motions (bending vibrations or some other fast motions that reorient the 13C-H vectors).
For the sake of completeness, we show how the theory of this paper can be formulated when fluctuations not only in the orientation but also in the internuclear separation are considered. The generalization of eq 12 is

where (7))0 is the relaxation time calculated for an isotropically reorienting sphere when rCH is set equal to r0.
B. Anisotropic Overall Motion. We now consider the generalization of the development to the situation where the overall motion cannot be described by a single correlation time (e.g., a cylindrical macromolecule or a random-coil polymer). When the overall motion is anisotropic, the first complication that arises is that the total correlation function cannot be rigorously factored into a product of contributions due to overall and internal motions even when it is assumed that these motions are independent (i.e., eq 10 is no longer rigorous). Nevertheless, we approximate the total correlation function as a product. Numerical evidence for the validity of this decoupling approximation will be presented later in this paper.
We shall use the same functional form for the internal correlation function as in the isotropic case (i.e., eq 24), so we are left with the problem of describing the correlation function for overall motion. For random-coil polymers, the usual approach to describing the highly anisotropic nature of the motion of the backbone involves the use of a distribution of correlation times21,22 (or equivalently diffusion coefficients). Specifically, if p(r) is the normalized probability that is between and r + dr, then the overall correlation function is represented as

C0(t) = Ysfp(r)e-^dT

(51)

A number of different ad hoc expressions have been used in the literature.21,22 One does not expect the resulting expression for

C0(t) to be very sensitive to the particular form of the distribution. The situation is analogous to the theory of heat capacities of solids where the Einstein, Debye, and exact normal-mode frequency
distributions are very different, yet the temperature dependence of the heat capacities are rather similar (except of course at very low temperatures). In this paper we set

(52)

and hence

C0(t) = %Ae-·!^ + y5(l - A)e-'!^

(53)

where A, ,, and r2 are adjustable parameters that can be determined by fitting the relaxation data of a nucleus that is attached to the macromolecular backbone. When A = 1, we recover the isotropic result (eq 11). It is interesting to note that eq 53 for the overall correlation function describing anisotropic motions has formally the same functional form as the total correlation function (overall and internal) for the case when the overall motion is isotropic (i.e., eq 32, A —1 S2, tm -*· ,, and r — r2). In summary, our expression for the total correlation function when the overall motion is anisotropic is
C(<) = x/fAe-'l'i + (1 - A)e-'lrf{S2 + (1 - ¿,2)<r'/r·) (54)

The generalized order parameter j1, which describes the spatial restriction of the internal motions, is now defined with respect
to a frame attached to a backbone nucleus whose anisotropic
motion is described by A, r,, and r2. As in the case of isotropic overall motion, it can be shown that
eq 37 (where now (7))0 are the relaxation times for anisotropic motion) is exact when (1) the internal motions are in the extreme narrowing limit and the internal correlation function decays much faster than the overall correlation function (i.e., J0“Co(f)(cos
t)(CY(t) - í2) di = Xo"(Q(0 - &2) dr), (2) the decoupling approximation is valid, and (3) re is defined as the area of the
internal correlation function. It is important to note that in proving the above, one does not require the overall correlation function to have the form given in eq 53 and, thus, the result holds more
generally. C. Relation to Previous Work. We shall now discuss the
relation of our model-free approach to analyzing NMR relaxation data to previous work. As mentioned in the introduction, the functional form for the internal correlation function (eq 24), on which our approach is based, is identical with an approximation to the correlation function within the diffusion in a cone model2*6
(in this model µ is restricted to diffuse in a cone of semiangle 0). Specifically, if the generalized order parameter is evaluated within this model (i.e., = Sronc), then the expressions are identical. It should be emphasized that the analysis of experimental data based on eq 24 is meaningful independent of whether the cone model is physically reasonable. In this regard, we mention the interesting work of Howarth,3 who analyzed a variety of experimental relaxation data by using the cone model. He showed that the data could be well reproduced even in cases where the cone model is not reasonable (e.g., for the carbons of an aliphatic side chain of a random-coil polymer). Our work explains why this is so: the cone angles he extracted may have no physical significance; however, the corresponding order parameters are physically
meaningful. Jardetzky and co-workers7*9 have previously considered “how
much definite information on internal mobility in proteins can be deduced from NMR relaxation measurements” and proposed an approach to “mapping internal motions in proteins”. Although their approach is operationally similar to ours in that the spectral density is represented as a sum of Lorentzians containing adjustable parameters, the motivation for using such expressions and interpretation of the parameters is quite different. For example, their work contains no reference to the concept of an order parameter. Moreover, they suggest that more and more experimental information (7), T2, and NOE’s at a large number of fields) will allow one to learn more and more about internal motions. We, on the other hand, emphasize that the information content of such data over a large range of frequencies on fast internal motions

4552 J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 104, No. 17, 1982

is redundant and, in fact, can be specified by just two quantities (i.e., of2 and re).
Since the papers of Jardetzky and co-workers7™9 use the technical jargon of the mathematical theory of Markov processes, it is perhaps useful to summarize our understanding of their work. In their first paper,7 they show formally how the spectral density can be expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a transition operator. They obtain a correlation function of the form

/ C(t) =

»'

(55)

n

and a corresponding spectral density

/( ) = 2 <*nK
ft \„2 + 2

(56)

where -X„ are the eigenvalues of the transition operator. They
then proceed to generalize the above expression to “TV independent motions” and obtain a spectral density of the same general form
as above. The entirely formal nature of this paper can be contrasted with the work of Wittebort and Szabo,11 who explicitly show how to construct the spectral density for a general jump model (i.e., a general discrete Markov process) and illustrate the formalism by considering the concerted motions of a lysine side chain. Jardetzky and co-workers7™9 refer to X„_1 in eq 55 and 56 as the correlation time for the “nth individual motion”. However, it is well-known that simple models containing only a few types of motions lead to correlation functions containing a large number of X„’s. For example, even in the Woessner model14 (a single free internal rotation superimposed on isotropic overall motion) one has three X’s (i.e., X0 = 6Du, X¡ = 6DM + D, and 2 = 6Z)M + 4D, where DM and D are the overall and internal diffusion coefficients). Moreover, the exact correlation function for the diffusion in the cone model4·19 (see eq A2) has an infinite number of components. In any case, they propose to use sufficiently extensive sets of relaxation data to determine all amplitudes an and relaxation times X„_1. This is, of course, not even possible in principle because the NMR experiment contains information about the individual values of only those a„ and X„’s for which X„-1 is sufficiently slow so as not to be in the extreme narrowing limit.
In a more recent paper,9 Jardetzky and co-workers indicate how to implement their approach in practice. They write the spectral
density as

/( )

=

2 /= ,·2 +

2

(57)

including as many terms as required to fit the experimental data. They refer to M as the “number of independent motions”, and 6, and X, are the effective amplitude and rate for the ¡th physical
motion. As discussed above, we find this terminology misleading. They say that a¡ does not have a simple physical interpretation.
They normalize á¡ such that µ« = 1 and call 100a, the percent
contribution of motion i to the relaxation. It is clear that all this
is quite different from our terminology. One of the disadvantages of eq 57 is that the contribution to
the spectral density of the overall motion of the macromolecule is not clearly shown. If there is an independent overall motion common to all parts of the system, there cannot be a component in the correlation function that decays more slowly than the overall motion. In our notation this can be seen immediately by using eq 11 and 13 in eq 10. Thus, within their approach, if one wanted to analyze NMR data on a protein by using the information on the overall motion extracted from the rotational diffusion coef-
ficient measured independently, this would imply two constraints: to fix one of the eigenvalues, say Xh and X,· > X, for all i = 2, ..., M. Since Jardetzky and co-workers do not impose restrictions on the relative magnitudes of the X’s, they can arrive at physical conclusions that are artifacts. This occurs in their analysis of relaxation data for various residues in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. To interpret the relaxation parameters, they set X¡ =

Lipari and Szabo

6 X 108 s™1, which is characteristic of the overall motion, and then find a component with X2 = 107 s™1, which they attribute to a general low-frequency distortion of the backbone. However, since
the internal motion is superimposed on the overall motion, internal motions (slow or otherwise) only result in components that decay faster than X, (e.g., X2 = Xi + X,, where Xj is the rate of internal
motion). The slow component could, in principle, arise from anisotropic overall motion, but this seems unlikely considering the shape of the molecule.
Finally, we point out that the simplest version of their approach
( = 2) is in fact formally identical with the simplest version
of ours. Setting = 2 in eq 57 and using a, + a2 = 1, we have

2a1X1
Xi2 + 2

2(1 - at)X2
X22 + 2

(58)

which apart from the factor 5™1 (which is incorporated into the expressions for the relaxation parameters) is identical with our eq 34 when X¡ = _1, X2 = r™1, and 8i is identified with the generalized order parameter (aj = =?2). However, operationally, eq 58 and 34 are identical only if the constraint X] < X2 is imposed,
since tm~* < r™1 (see eq 33).

III. Range of Validity
In this section we investigate the range of validity of the model-free approach by analyzing NMR relaxation data that were generated by using sophisticated dynamical models for which the values of j12 and re are known exactly. Using the model-free expressions for the spectral density (e.g., eq 34 for isotropic overall
motion) and treating j12 and re as the only adjustable parameters, we least-squares fit the relaxation data and then compare the resulting numerical values of <£2 and re with their exact values. The rather complicated spectral densities that were used in generating the data are described in the Appendix. We have seen in the Theory section that the model-free approach is exact when the internal motions are in the extreme narrowing limit. Here
we wish to quantify this result and determine how well the approach works for slower internal motions. We will give a set of empirical rules that allow one to determine the accuracy of the extracted values of re and j12 by considering only their numerical values, the parameters for overall motion, and the resonance frequencies. This is important in the analysis of experimental data (see accompanying paper), where, of course, the exact values of the order parameter and the effective correlation times are not known. We have analyzed a large number of “simulated” data sets, and we present below the results of only a representative
sample. We consider both isotropic (subsection A) and anisotropic
(subsection B) overall motions.
A. Isotropic Overall Motion. We consider systems whose overall motion can be described by a single correlation time, rM. Before presenting the results of a systematic study based on relaxation data that we have generated using the models described in the appendix, we show how well the model-free approach works for the relaxation data calculated by Levy et al.23 for a pseudo side
chain in a macromolecule using molecular dynamics. Briefly, Levy et al.23 obtained trajectories describing the motion of a heptane molecule by using the diffusive Langevin equation. Then they mimicked a pseudo side chain of a macromolecule by isotropically
reorienting the C¡-C2 bond (i.e., C2 is an “a carbon” whose relaxation is described by rM). Finally, they calculated 7,, T2, and NOE for carbons C3, C4, C5, and C6 at two fields with rM
= 1, 10, and 100 ns. The generalized order parameters defined in this paper can be related to “configuration averages of Wigner functions”, which they tabulate. Specifically, #2 for the carbons 3-6 is simply 4ir times the entries in their Table X. It is interesting to note that j1™2 is identical with the “motional averaging scale
factor” Levy and co-workers define in another paper.24 In Table I we present the results of the analysis of the simulated
data of Levy et al.23 using the model-free approach. We fixed

parentheses.

tm at 10 ns and least-squares fit their 7, and NOE values (but not 72’s) at the two fields simultaneously to extract numerical values of P2 and re. We then predicted the 72 values at both fields. It can be seen that the model-free approach can reproduce the
data extremely well. Moreover, the predicted 72’s are in excellent agreement with the exact results. Finally, the generalized order parameters extracted from the relaxation data agree remarkably well with their exact values. Note, in particular, that the nonmonotonic behavior of P2 as one goes out the chain, which appears to be a hallmark of concerted motions, is reproduced. A similar comparison for re is not possible since Levy et al.23 did not present exact values of this quantity. We have performed similar analyses of their data for = 1 and 100 ns. The results are almost as
impressive (P2 for C4 is somewhat overestimated when = 1 ns, and T2 information is required when = 100 ns to get highly accurate values of P2). In fact, we were able to find a misprint in a preprint of their paper (we correctly predicted that the NOE at 15 MHz for C4 with = 100 ns should be 2.93 instead of
2.83). Why does the model-free approach work so well? Basically,
because the internal motions are sufficiently fast so as to be close to the extreme narrowing limit. In this limit, the information on internal motions contained in the NMR relaxation experiment is rigorously completely specified by P2 and re. Therefore, one should be able to extract P2 and re from just two experimental relaxation parameters when these parameters are known for the
overall motion. Suppose we know 7,’s at two fields in the presence
and absence of internal motion (i.e., 7,, 7, and (7,)0, (7,)0). In the extreme narrowing limit, these quantities are related by eq 37. Since we have two equations (one for each field) in two unknowns (P2 and rc), we immediately have

where (7,)0 and NOE0 are the relaxation parameters describing the overall motion. In favorable cases (e.g., sufficiently fast internal motions and accurate data), these equations allow one to obtain P2 and re directly from experimental data. We will make extensive use of these equations below and in part 2 of this series, where we will show that they work remarkably well for real
systems.

The C/VT,)o and NOE0 are respectively 23.8 ms and 1.30 at 15 MHz and 266 ms and 1.16 at 68 MHz. Considering the simplicity of the analysis, the general agreement among the values is re-
markable. The P2’s obtained by using only the 7,’s are excellent, except for C4, where P2 is slightly overestimated. The P2’s obtained from the 7,’s and NOE’s at low field are virtually exact. This is to be expected since at this frequency the internal motions are very close to the extreme narrowing limit. The P2’s obtained using only 7,’s and NOE’s at high field are quite poor except for C3. This is a consequence of the relative slowness of the internal motions (i.e., at high field the internal motions are further from
the extreme narrowing limit) and the fact that the exact values of the order parameters are very small. As we shall see below, 7, and NOE data at 68 MHz determine P2 and re better when P2 is larger (i.e., P2 > 0.01) and/or tc is faster.
We now present the results of a systematic investigation of the range of validity of the model-free approach. The conclusions reached by exploring a large number of simulated data will be illustrated with numerous examples.
We consider first the case where the internal motions are in
the extreme narrowing limit. In this limit, the spectral density
is given exactly by eq 36; i.e., one has exactly

1 + (cor)2

(61)

where "1 = ~* + Te_1. We call fast internal motions those for which eq 61 holds to within 10% for the largest frequency de-
termining the relaxation parameters, e.g., o>c + for 13C dipolar relaxation. We found that for fast internal motions, virtually exact values of P2 and tc can be obtained from a pair of relaxation parameters (e.g., NOE and 7,) at two fields. For example, for a 13C NMR frequency of ~90 MHz, if ~ 10 ns, motions such that tc 5 100 ps may be considered fast. At a given magnetic field and fixed tm, as tc decreases the agreement between the two sides of eq 61 gets better and, of course, if tc is fast enough, eq 61 becomes an identity. For example, for 13C-H dipolar relaxation at a Larmor frequency of 90.5 MHz, if = 10 ns and tc = 25

ps, ( 6)2 = 5 X 10~3, re/rM = 2.5 X 10"3, and eq 61 errs by only ~0.7%. If the contribution to the spectral density of the re term is really frequency independent, one should be able to extract the exact values of P2 and re and predict very accurately the relaxation data at any other field (such that eq 61 still holds) only from, say, the measurement of two relaxation data at one field. On the basis
of extensive numerical experimentation, we conjecture that if eq 61 holds to within ~2%, this is indeed the case. Motions of this nature will be called extremely fast internal motions. In the case of extremely fast motions, eq 61 is virtually exact and P2 and re can be determined very accurately by using the analytical expressions 59a and 59b for 7) data at two fields or eq 60a and 60b for Tx and NOE data at one field. For example, for 13C-‘H dipolar relaxation with = 10~8, at a 13C resonance frequency of ~90.5 MHz, internal motions such that re 5 50 ps fall in this category. Table III illustrates an example of extremely fast internal motions for Woessner’s diffusional model. Exact data
were generated for = 10“8 s, ß = 70.5°, and 1/6D = 10.6 ps. Fitting only Tx and NOE at high field, we can extract cP2 and re almost exactly and predict very accurately the other relaxation data. For these fast internal motions, one can use simple analytical formulas to extract <P2 and re from a set of two relaxation data, e.g., 7j and NOE at 90.5 MHz. Using eq 60a and 60b with (Tx)0 = 461 ms, NOE0 = 1.16, one obtains P2 = 0.114, re = 31.1 ps (with an error of less than 1%); using eq 37 with (T2)0 = 22.6 ms, one predicts T2 = 178 ms at 90.5 MHz (exact value 182 ms). For the relaxation parameters at low field, using eq 37 for Tx and
T2 and eq 38 for the NOE with (7j)0 = 46.6 ms, ( 2)0 = 18.1
ms, and NOE0 = 1.21, one predicts Tx = 332 ms (exact value 335 ms), T2 = 146 ms (exact value 149 ms), and NOE = 1.55
(exact value 1.51).
It is of some interest that, in the limit of extremely fast internal
motions, the spectral density at nonzero frequencies is fairly insensitive to large percent variations of P2 when P2 is very small, say 50.005, whereas the zero-frequency term depends strongly on P2, especially if rM is relatively slow. For example, if rM = 10“7 s, re = 19 ps, and P2 = 3 X 10"3, a change in P2 of 53% brings about a variation in Tx and NOE of less than 0.1%, whereas the T2 values change by 29%. However, given the physical interpretation of the generalized order parameter, it is uninteresting to determine P2 very accurately when it is that small. In general, for large amplitude motions, small changes in the allowed spatial range bring about a large percent change in the value of the generalized order parameter. For example, in the diffusion in a cone model, an order parameter of 3.0 X 10“3 corresponds to a cone angle of ~84°; P2 = 4.5 X 10'3 corresponds to a cone angle of ~83°. Thus, a variation of ~50% in the order parameter involves a change of only ~1% in the cone angle. Even for extremely fast motions, if P2 5 10'3, usually T2 information is required to extract the exact value of the order parameter. Thus, if one uses <P2 values extracted only from Tx and NOE data to predict T2 values when P2 is very small, the T2 values are likely
to be inaccurate.
We now present some examples of the model-free analysis of relaxation data when some of the internal motions are not fast
while others are in the extreme narrowing limit. To illustrate this point, let us consider the model of Brainard and Szabo6 for the motion of a carbon nonrigidly attached to a spherical macromolecule in such a way that the C-H vector can rotate freely about an axis d, which in turn is allowed to wobble within a cone of semiangle 0 about a director d attached to the macromolecule. The angle between the C-H vector and d is fixed at a value ß. The correlation time for the motion about d is T|¡, and t± is the

correlation time for the wobbling of the d axis. Exact NMR data were generated for ß = 70.5°, = 30°, rM = 10 ns, ± = 100 ns, and t¡| = 10 ps by using eq 15 of ref 6. The order parameter for this model is 0.072. For no motion of the d axis, P2 = 0.11.

Fitting Tx and NOE values at 25 and 90 MHz by using the

model-free approach, we obtained re = 30 ps and P2 = 0.11, which
correspond to no motion of d. Addition of T2 information gives virtually identical results. In this case, for one internal motion,

the slow internal motion is “invisible”. We then considered the

Brainard-Szabo model with all the parameters as in the above example except that r± was set at a value of 1 ns. Fitting Tx and NOE values at both fields, we obtained P2 = 0.089 and re = 40 ps. The addition of T2 information gives P2 = 0.079 and re =
41 ps. The effective correlation time appears to be fast, but the order parameter has a value that is intermediate between 0.11

(corresponding to rotation about the d axis only) and 0.072

(corresponding to rotation and wobbling).

We now turn to the case where all the internal motions are not

close to the extreme narrowing limit. In this case, both terms in

the model-free expression for the spectral density depend on frequency. It is important to realize that, in general, the correlation

function for internal motions is not accurately described by a single exponential. The consequences of the one-exponential approximation are particularly severe for motions that are not very restricted (small values of P2) or, irrespective of the spatial extent of the motions, if the time scale of the motions is slow. For

relatively slow motions, we observed that, with very few exceptions, the trend is to predict values of P2 that are too large and values of re that are too small.
Table IV shows the results obtained by using the model-free

approach to analyze 13C relaxation data generated by using

Woessner’s model14 for

= 10 ns, 1/6Z> = 99.3 ps, and ß =

70.5°. For these relatively slow internal motions, it is still possible

to extract fairly accurate values of P2 and re (in error by 25%

and 15%, respectively) from a set of Tx and NOE measurements

at two fields. The predicted values of T2 are in good agreement

with the exact values at both fields (with an error of 11% at high

field and of 7% at low field).

Table V shows the results obtained by fitting NMR data for

13C-'H dipolar relaxation at 25.1 and 90.5 MHz for the diffusion

in a cone model with

= 10™8 s, 1/6Z)w = 7.03 ns and 0.703

ns, and two cone angles, 0 = 36.9° and 66.4°. In both cases, by

fitting 7j and NOE at both fields, one can reproduce very ac-

curately the exact data. The values of P2 and re extracted improve

as the time scale of the motion gets faster. P2 is about 9% larger

than its true value, 1 /6DW = 7.03 ns. One predicts a value in error by only 1.7% by including T2 information at both fields. Notice
that re extracted by fitting 7j and NOE values at both fields (1/6Z)w = 7.03 ns) is 3.80 ns. Inclusion of T2 information at both fields in the fitting procedure for 1 /6£>w = 7.03 ns gives re = 4.20 ns, which is closer to the true value of rs. For faster internal

motions, however, (1 /6Z)W = 0.703 ns) re predicted by using Tx and NOE information at both fields is 0.437 ns, i.e., only 1.6% shorter than its exact value. Inclusion of T2 information has little or no effect on the extracted value of re. For a cone angle of 0

= 66.4°, the exact data can be reproduced, but the predicted values of P2 and re are not accurate for re = 9.9 ns. P2 errs by a factor of 2, and inclusion of T2 information does not improve this value.
Using Tx and NOE at both fields, one obtains re = 6.80 ns. The situation is better for the faster motion (re = 0.99 ns). In this case, the addition of T2 information improves substantially the predicted value of P2 (the error is 16% vs. 73% for the prediction based on the Tx and NOE information at two fields only).

Tables IV and V show certain trends that extensive numerical
investigations have confirmed for all the dynamical models studied. In general, one can fit NMR data from any model at all fields and arbitrary time scale and overall motion. The accuracy of the predicted values of S'2 and re, however, depends crucially on the spatial restriction and time scale of the motion. As the order parameter gets smaller, the accuracy of the prediction of the value of ef2 gets worse. For a given order parameter, the accuracy of the prediction improves as the time scale of the motion gets faster. For motions that are not fast, we conjecture that up to values of
tc such that ( )2 ~ 1, where is the largest relevant frequency
determining the relaxation data, the order parameter and can be extracted from a set of measurements of 7, and NOE at two fields with an error no larger than ~25%. For a 13C Larmor
frequency of ~90.5 MHz, one has ( ,)2 ~ 1 for tc ~350 ps.
For example, for the diffusion in a cone model, for = 10~8 s and 1 /67>w = 167 ps, one predicts, using NOE and 7, at 25.1 and
90.5 MHz, S'2 = 0.0898 (exact value 0.0784) and „ = 218 ps
(exact value 236 ps). In applications, one is sometimes interested in internal motions
that are slow on the NMR time scale, i.e., ( )2 > 1. There seems
to be no simple criterion to determine accurately the magnitude of the error involved. We estimate, however, that order parameters larger than ~0.3 can be predicted with an accuracy of ~30%. For order parameters larger than 0.5, the accuracy is likely to be better, probably ~15%.
It is also interesting to consider the question whether measurements at several different fields can provide more information on the dynamics of the relaxation process. Table VI shows the results obtained for the jump model of Wittebort and Szabo for the lysine side chain attached to a spherical macromolecule. For
tm = 1CT8 s, data were generated at eight different magnetic fields, corresponding to Larmor frequencies ranging from 15 to 100 MHz. The table shows the results obtained by fitting T¡ and NOE
at two fields and the results obtained by fitting 7, and NOE at eight fields. The exact values of te range from 278 to 31.5 ps, and S’2 from 0.33 to 0.0046. Remarkably, the values of te and j12 extracted by fitting 7, and NOE at 25.1 and 67.9 MHz and by fitting 7, and NOE at eight fields are almost identical. The fitted values of Tx and NOE and the predicted T2’s are also very
close. For the ß carbon, = 266 ns and of2 = 0.333. The extracted values of á12 and t„ are good, since <£2 is large. For the 7 carbon, however, the exact value of S'2 is 0.00926 and the extracted value of S'2 is about twice as big. The and e carbons are in the fast-motion regime, and one can extract the values of re and <£2 accurately. This example indicates that the addition of information of data measured at a number of different fre-

quencies does not change the values of <£2 and te predicted. Some of the motions in the above example are rather fast. However, considering motions 1 order of magnitude slower, i.e., the jump model of Wittebort and Szabo with k¡ = k2 = k¡, /c,™1 = 10~9 s,
= 10"8 s, we obtained similar results.
B. Anisotropic Overall Motion. In subsection IIB we considered the application of the model-free approach to cases where the overall motion cannot be described by a single correlation time. The correlation function is factored in two terms, one describing the overall motion (eq 53) and the other for internal motions relative to the macromolecule, which has the usual model-free
expression given by eq 32. In order to justify this approximation, we show first with an example that for anisotropic motions such “decoupling" of internal and overall motion is accurate. The expression for the correlation function for the diffusion in a cone model superimposed on anisotropic overall motion is given in the Appendix, eq All. We now consider a correlation function of the form

which factors out the internal motion contribution. Equation 62 has a form similar to the isotropic case, except for the fact that the correlation function for the macromolecular motion has a more
complicated structure. Table VII shows the results obtained by fitting 13C NMR relaxation data generated at 25.1 and 90.5 MHz from eq All with a correlation function given by eq 62. Dx, Dz, and jSMD were held fixed while and te were allowed to vary. Exact data correspond to 1/6Dx = 10 gs, 1 /6Dz = 0.5 jus, 1 /6Z>W = 2.16 ns, 0 = 66.4° (/?MD = 15°) and 1 /6£>w = 2.60 ns, 0 = 36.9° (j3md = 55°). Values of 1/6Dx in the range 1-20 µ$ and of l/6Z)z in the range 0.1-0.05 µ$ are typical of DNA fragments ~ 102 base pairs long.18 The relaxation data can be reproduced well, and <£2 and te are predicted accurately in both cases. Notice that the two cases considered here are rather unfavorable, since
the motions are relatively slow. For dMD = 15°, the amplitude of the motion is rather large, and for /jMD = 55°, the order parameter for the total correlation function (i.e., the limit of the total correlation function as t —1 °°) given by eq A13 is extremely small
(3.33 X 1CT6), since ß is close to the “magic angle”. This
numerical example shows that it is reasonable to separate the correlation function into a term describing the macromolecular motion and a term describing the internal motion. In applications, one has to determine the parameters for the overall motion from relaxation data for a nucleus attached to the macromolecular
backbone. Such measurements may be actually available (e.g., data for a carbons in proteins in a helical conformation) or may

be simulated if the parameters for the motion of the macromolecule are known from other experiments (e.g., hydrodynamic or light-scattering measurements). One has to determine A, r,,
and t2 in this fashion; subsequently, when data are interpreted for nuclei that have internal motions, the parameters for internal motions will be allowed to vary while A, rlf and t2 are held fixed.
Extensive numerical investigations showed that even in the case of the anisotropic motions, the internal motions can be adequately described by using the model-free approach. The accuracy of the predicted values of P2 and re depends on the time scale of the motion. However, the procedure used in determining the parameters for the overall motion introduces an additional error in
the approximate correlation functions, and the inclusion of T2 information may improve slightly the accuracy of the predicted values of P2 and rc. We will briefly summarize the results of our numerical investigations and then present some illustrative ex-
amples. The first case of interest is the one of extremely fast motions,
i.e., motions such that eq 61 is satisfied to within ~2%, where
now is defined as r~’ = 2_1 + ~ (recall that we assume that
tj and r2 are defined in such a way that r1 > r2). In this case, a set of measurements (e.g., NOE and 7,) at one field can give accurate values of P2 and re, and relaxation data at all other fields such that (4) is satisfied to within ~2% can be predicted accurately. For anisotropic overall motion, however, the inclusion of information at another field (e.g., 7, and NOE) does slightly improve the extracted values of P2 and re, probably due to the method employed in determining the parameters for the macromolecular motion. A simple general criterion to determine the accuracy of the predicted values of P2 for arbitrary values of r¡ and t2 does not seem to exist; however, we estimate that as long
as the overall motion is not too slow ( , < 0.1 ps), data at one
field should give P2 values accurate to within ~5%, with the accuracy improving for larger order parameters. For fast internal motions, i.e., motions such that eq 61 is satisfied to within ~10%, one can extract accurate values of P2 and re from a set of measurements (e.g., 7t and NOE) at two fields. Again, the situation is slightly worse than in the isotropic case. We estimate that as long as 2 < 0.1 ps, one can predict P2 with an error no larger than ~20%, with the error being substantially smaller for larger order parameters. By including T2 information, one obtains virtually exact answers.
Slower motions follow a pattern similar to the one observed in the isotropic case. For motions such that (o>re)2 á 1, one can obtain fairly accurate values of P2 from a set of measurements at both fields including T2 information. For large order parameters (P2 2; 0.4), one can obtain accurate values of P2 and re for motions on all time scales.
Table VIII describes results obtained for the diffusion in a cone
model superimposed to an overall anisotropic motion with 1 /6DX = 1 ps, 1/6D2 = 0.05 ps, and /3Md = 15°. Exact results were generated for 13C-’H dipolar relaxation at 25.1 and 90.5 MHz: for 0 = 66.4°, 1/6Z)w = 10.9, 56.4 and 97.6 ps. For the fastest motion (1 /6Z>W = 10.9 ps), we obtain an accurate prediction of both P2 and re just by fitting 7, and NOE at high field. The extracted P2 value is slightly improved by fitting NOE and T{ at both fields. For 1/67>W = 56.4 ps, using 7, and NOE at both fields, one obtains P2 = 0.116 (the exact value is 0.0784), re = 81.9 ps (the exact value is 79.8 ps). By including T2 information, one obtains P2 = 0.0783 and re = 78.9 ps. For the slowest motion (1/6£>w = 97.6 ps, re = 137 ps), one obtains P2 = 0.2041 and re = 155 ps by fitting just NOE and Tl at both fields; i.e., without including T2 information, the predicted value of the order parameter is about three times bigger than the exact value. The inclusion of T2 information, however, allows a very accurate prediction of both P2 and re that differs from their exact values by 0.1% and 1.5%, respectively.
We now show that the model-free approach for overall anisotropic motions is accurate even in cases where a distribution of correlation times has been invoked (e.g., for random-coil polymers).

and the results obtained by using the analytical formulas given in eq 59a, 59b, 60a, and 60b are presented. The values of ef2 and re extracted from 7j and NOE at 15 MHz by using eq 60a and 60b, respectively, are excellent since at this frequency the motions of all the carbons are close to the extreme narrowing limit. The situation is different for the values of #2 and re extracted from
, and NOE at 68 MHz; at this resonance frequency, only the
motions for carbons & and e are not far from the extreme narrowing limit. The «f2’s and re’s obtained from TVs at both fields by using eq 59a and 59b, respectively, are better than the values obtained
analytically from , and NOE at high field, but not as accurate as the results from , and NOE at low field. It is remarkable
how good the general agreement between the values is, considering
the simplicity of the analysis of this system where the motion is highly anisotropic. Of course the agreement between exact and calculated values would be even better for internal motions on a faster time scale. In summary, the trend in the accuracy of the extracted j12 and re seems to be basically unaltered by the form of the correlation function for overall motion. The accuracy of j12 and re depends essentially only on the magnitude of the order parameter and the time scale of internal motions. Even in the anisotropic case, for fast internal motions accurate values of S’2 and re can be extracted by using a straightforward fitting procedure or, for motions close to the extreme narrowing limit, from simple analytical formulas.

Appendix In this Appendix we describe the various dynamic models that
we have used to generate relaxation data. We do this not only for the sake of completeness but also to contrast the complexity of the correlation functions or spectral densities of these models with the simplicity of eq 32 and 54, which are used in the model-free approach.
In Woessner’s model,14 a single free internal rotation is superimposed on isotropic reorientation. Specifically, the interaction vector µ diffuses freely, with diffusion coefficient D, about a symmetry axis rigidly attached to the macromolecule. The angle ß between µ and the symmetry axis does not changes with time.

The jump model of Wittebort and Szabo11 for the concerted motions of a lysine side chain can be described as follows. The possible configurations of the entire chain are limited to 24 discrete configurations on a diamond lattice as shown in Figure 6b of their paper. The rate matrix R describing the interconversion of their configurations by means of «-bond (« = 1, 2, 3) motions is represented in their Figure 8b. The orientations µ,· (described by polar angles /?NF' and aNF ) of the various 13C-H vectors is contained in their Tables II, HI, and IV.
By using their general jump formalism,11 we can express the correlation function for the case in which the overall motion is
isotopic in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetrized rate matrix, R, i.e.,

Abstract: In the preceding paper it has been shown that the unique dynamic information on fast internal motions in an NMR relaxation experiment on macromolecules in solution is specified by a generalized order parameter, <f, and an effective correlation time, re. This paper deals with the extraction and interpretation of this information. The procedure used to obtain S2 and tc from experimental data by using a least-squares method and, in certain favorable circumstances, by using an analytical formula is described. A variety of experiments are then analyzed to yield information on the time scale and spatial restriction of internal motions of isoleucines in myoglobin, methionines in dihydrofolate reductase and myoglobin, a number of aliphatic residues in basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and ethyl isocyanide bound to myoglobin, hemoglobin, and aliphatic side chains in three random-coil polymers. The numerical values of £2 and re can be readily interpreted within the framework of a variety of models. In this way, one can obtain the same physical picture of internal motions as that obtained by using complicated spectral densities to fit the data. The numerical value of the order parameter, unlike the effective correlation time re, plays a crucial role in determining what models can be used to describe the experiment; models in which the order parameter cannot be reproduced are eliminated. Conversely, any model that can yield the correct value of £ works.

I. Introduction
In the preceding paper1 (hereafter referred to as paper 1), we addressed the question of the information content of NMR relaxation data and of the extraction of this information. We presented a model-free approach to this problem, showing that the dynamic information on fast internal motions contained in an NMR experiment is essentially specified by two parameters:

(1) a generalized order parameter, which is a measure of the degree of spatial restriction of the motion, and (2) an effective correlation time, re, which is a measure of the rate (time scale) of the motion. These two parameters were defined in a modelindependent way. For both isotropic and anisotropic overall motion we derived expressions for the appropriate spectral density (which determines the observable quantities in the NMR relaxation ex-
