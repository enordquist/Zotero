functional channel arising from the tetrameric assembly of four asubunits18. Although the transmembrane segments (S1–S6, Fig. 1a) of each a-subunit17,19 share homology with voltage-gated Kþ channels, each a-subunit uniquely contains an extensive C terminus with four additional hydrophobic segments (S7–S10). The C terminus is probably composed of two modular units, as expression in oocytes of separate messages for S0–S8 and S9–S10 peptides produces channels identical to wild-type BK channels20. Whereas the Ca2þ bowl is contained within the S9–S10 peptide, the Cterminal structure with the S7–S8 segments contains the RCK domain, a second potential regulatory element (Fig. 1a, b) that exhibits extensive homology with a number of bacterial Kþ channels. The structures of two prokaryotic RCK domains have been determined12,21 and RCK domains may contain binding sites for a variety of regulatory ligands, including nucleotides22 and cations21.
To address the role of the RCK domain in BK channel regulation, we took advantage of the fact that a homologue of Slo1, the Slo3 pHsensitive Kþ channel, lacks Ca2þ-dependent regulation13,23,24. We focused on residues near folds in the RCK domain that contribute to nucleotide binding in prokaryotic homologues (Fig. 1c). We were

Large conductance, Ca21- and voltage-activated K1 channels (BK) respond to two distinct physiological signals—membrane voltage and cytosolic Ca21 (refs 1, 2). Channel opening is regulated by changes in Ca21 concentration spanning 0.5 mM to 50 mM (refs 2–5), a range of Ca21 sensitivity unusual among Ca21-regulated proteins. Although voltage regulation arises from mechanisms shared with other voltage-gated channels6–8, the mechanisms of Ca21 regulation remain largely unknown. One potential Ca21-regulatory site, termed the ‘Ca21 bowl’, has been located to the large cytosolic carboxy terminus9–11. Here we show that a second region of the C terminus, the RCK domain (regulator of conductance for K1 (ref. 12)), contains residues that deﬁne two additional regulatory effects of divalent cations. One site, together with the Ca21 bowl, accounts for all physiological regulation of BK channels by Ca21; the other site contributes to effects of millimolar divalent cations that may mediate physiological regulation by cytosolic Mg21 (refs 5, 13). Independent regulation by multiple sites explains the large concentration range over which BK channels are regulated by Ca21. This allows BK channels to serve a variety of physiological roles contingent on the Ca21 concentration to which the channels are exposed14,15.
A recent advance in understanding the regulation of BK channels by Ca2þ was the demonstration that distinct, independent binding sites for Ca2þ may explain the range of intracellular Ca2þ concentration ([Ca2þ]i) that regulates channel opening5,13. Over the physiological range of [Ca2þ]i, relatively Ca2þ-selective site(s) mediate channel regulation. In contrast, the effects of [Ca2þ]i in the millimolar range reﬂect a lower sensitivity site showing selectivity for Ca2þ and Mg2þ. Here we deﬁne principal structural elements required for each Ca2þ-dependent regulatory effect. BK channel a-subunits are encoded by a single Slo1 gene16,17, with a

particularly interested in negatively charged residues conserved in Ca2þ-dependent forms of Slo1 (for example, Drosophila and mouse
Slo1 (dSlo1 and mSlo1, respectively)), but not in Slo3. To assess whether a construct exhibits altered Ca2þ-dependent gating, we examined the activation characteristics over a range of [Ca2þ]i and [Mg2þ]i. In accordance with allosteric models of BK channel activation4,5,7,13, this approach reveals to what extent a structural alteration inﬂuences divalent cation binding, movement of the
voltage sensors, or the closed–open conformational equilibria.

We ﬁrst compared the Ca2þ sensitivity of wild-type BK currents arising from Slo1 a-subunits to that arising from Slo1 subunits with a mutated Ca2þ bowl region (5D5N; see Methods). This mutation abolishes function of the Ca2þ bowl9,11. Currents resulting from the 5D5N construct still exhibit substantial regulation by Ca2þ, although the ability of [Ca2þ]i at less than 10 mM to cause channel activation is reduced relative to wild-type currents (Fig. 2a, b). As seen in a comparison of conductance–voltage (G–V) curves (Fig. 2e, f), both constructs exhibit similar activation in the absence of Ca2þ, but [Ca2þ]i below 10 mM has less effect in the 5D5N construct.
We next examined whether the RCK domain contributes to Ca2þ-dependent regulation of current that persists after mutation of the Ca2þ bowl. Of the prokaryotic channels containing an RCK domain, only some contain the conserved motif between b-sheet A and a-helix B (Fig. 1c) that deﬁnes nucleotide binding22. This region of Slo1 and Slo3 exhibits no obvious residues that might account for a difference in Ca2þ sensitivity. However, at the end of aA and through the linker up to bB, there are three aspartate residues (D362, D367 and D369 in mSlo1) conserved in Slo1 forms, but which are neutral or positively charged in Slo3. Compared with bacterial homologues12, the linker between aA and bB in the Slo family of subunits contains ﬁve extra residues (Fig. 1c), suggesting an important functional role for this segment.
The point mutations D362A and D369A each resulted in currents with Ca2þ sensitivity similar to wild-type currents, with a slight effect of D362A at lower [Ca2þ]i. In contrast, D367A produced a marked reduction in the ability of Ca2þ to shift gating. Constructs D362A/D367A and D362A/D367A/D369A exhibited behaviour similar to D367A alone. We focused on the D362A/D367A double mutant. Currents arising from D362A/D367A exhibited reduced Ca2þ-dependent regulation of activation (Fig. 2c). The resulting G– V curves (Fig. 2g) show that the full shift in gating over all [Ca2þ]i with the D362A/D367A mutation is less than that in 5D5N, although D362A/D367A exhibits more sensitivity to [Ca2þ]i below 10 mM (Fig. 2f, g).

loci reﬂect the independent contribution of two Ca2þ-regulatory elements, the magnitude of the shifts in V 1/2 resulting from the effects of each individual site should sum to be similar to the effect of the combined mutation5,7,13 (equation (3); see also Methods). Therefore, we summed the residual shift in V1/2 after mutation of both sites with the increments in V 1/2 attributable to the Ca2þ bowl and to the D362/D367 site (Fig. 2k, open diamonds). The correspondence between wild-type values of V 1/2 and those predicted from adding the 5D5N and D362A/D367A mutations suggests that each locus acts in a relatively independent way to regulate BK gating4,5,13.
With [Ca2þ]i above 1 mM, the 5D5N plus D362A/D367A mutants show an additional 50–60-mV negative shift in V 1/2, despite the lack of effect of [Ca2þ]i below 1 mM (Fig. 2k). This effect is similar to previously described low-afﬁnity effects of Mg2þ (refs 5, 13, 25, 26) and Ca2þ (refs 5, 13) on BK activation. We therefore examined the ability of Mg2þ to produce shifts in activation in 5D5N and D362A/D367A, and the combined 5D5N plus D362A/D367A mutations. In all cases (Fig. 3a–c), the Mg2þinduced shift in activation was similar to that observed in wild-type currents, indicative that the mechanism responsible for the Mg2þ effect was intact. This also indicates that 5D5N and D362A/D367A do not nonspeciﬁcally alter the ability of the channel to be regulated.
We next examined the role of the RCK domain on effects of millimolar concentrations of divalent cations. E399 is conserved in mammalian, ﬂy and worm Slo1 sequences, but not in Slo3. Its location on the bC sheet (Fig. 1b–c) may position it near the putative ligand-binding region. The point mutation E399A resulted in currents with reduced sensitivity only above 1 mM Ca2þ (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, E399A reduced the ability of Mg2þ to shift gating (Fig. 3g). E399A, when paired either with 5D5N (Fig 3e, h) or D362A/D367A (Fig. 3f, i), reduced the effects of both millimolar Ca2þ and millimolar Mg2þ to shift gating. In all constructs containing E399A, the V 1/2 shift resulting from increasing [Ca2þ]i from 1 to 100 mM is reduced by about 30–40 mV. The V 1/2 shift produced by raising [Mg2þ]i from 0 to 100 mM was reduced from about 110 mV to about 60 mV. The similarity of the effect of E399A in all constructs suggests that the divalent cation effect inﬂuenced by E399 acts independently of other Ca2þ-regulatory elements. Thus, E399 seems to deﬁne an independent lower-afﬁnity, divalent cationregulatory effect.
If E399 accounts for most of the additional effects of Ca2þ at millimolar concentrations, the triple mutant construct 5D5N plus D362A/D367A, plus E399A might be expected to abolish all Ca2þ sensitivity. Remarkably, currents resulting from the triple mutant did not simply exhibit insensitivity to Ca2þ, but were markedly suppressed as Ca2þ was elevated from 300 mM through to 100 mM (Fig. 4a). Although rapid block of open channels by millimolar concentrations of Ca2þ or Mg2þ is a common feature of these channels5,13,27, such open channel block is rapidly relieved on hyperpolarization, with little steady-state block at potentials negative to 2100 mV. Yet, for the triple mutant construct, currents are strongly inhibited in a voltage-independent fashion. Furthermore, the Ca2þ-dependent inhibition is associated with a rightward shift in the G–V curve compared with that in 0 Ca2þ (Fig. 4c). In contrast, in the triple mutation constructs Mg2þ still produces shifts in activation to more negative potentials (Fig. 4b).
What is the mechanism by which E399A in conjunction with mutation of the other two loci produces this suppression of current? The energetic additivity of the effects of 5D5N, D362A/D367A (Fig. 2k) and E399A (Fig. 3d–f) indicates that none of the mutations produce a nonspeciﬁc suppression in the ability of current to be regulated by Ca2þ. An alternative explanation is that one mutation has altered the properties of a Ca2þ-binding site, such that Ca2þ now binds more tightly to the closed channel than to the open channel. For an allosteric model in which distinct regulatory sites independently regulate the channel closed-to-open equilibria5,7,13,

such a change in afﬁnity will suppress current activation and shift

G–V curves to the right. In accordance with general pharmacological principles, in the triple mutant Ca2þ now appears to act as an inverse agonist at one of the Ca2þ-binding sites. We propose that

D362/D367 is probably responsible for this effect, although this will

require more investigation. We have evaluated the behaviour of the

wild-type currents and the various mutants in terms of a three-

regulatory-site model (Fig. 4e). This model adequately accounts for

many of the principal features of the behaviour of V1/2 for all of the

constructs, and supports the validity of the allosteric model of

regulation of BK gating4,5,7,13,28. These results show that the RCK domain is critical to Ca2þ-

dependent regulation of BK channels and participates in both

higher (D362 and D367) and lower (E399) afﬁnity effects of divalent

cations. Irrespective of whether any of the critical residues in the

RCK domain mediates binding with divalent cations, mutation of

these residues clearly disrupts channel regulatory mechanisms that are intimately associated with speciﬁc aspects of Ca2þ-dependent

activation. Do these loci actually reﬂect divalent cation binding

sites? We currently consider this an attractive hypothesis. First, the

principal residues are situated in positions with proximity to the

nucleotide-binding sites described in other homologues, suggesting

a similar regulatory role. Second, the principal residues are anionic.

Third, the results suggest that a speciﬁc mutation has resulted in a change in Ca2þ-binding afﬁnities, such that Ca2þ now acts to

inhibit current activation. If a mutation simply disrupted transduction of a process regulated by a Ca2þ-binding site located elsewhere,

a change in molecular binding afﬁnities would not be expected.

However, it remains plausible that the mutations studied here have

simply disrupted the ability of the RCK domain to exert regulatory effects mediated by Ca2þ binding elsewhere.
The presence of multiple Ca2þ-dependent regulatory domains on the Slo1 a-subunit, each with different afﬁnities for Ca2þ, provides a mechanism by which the broad concentration range of Ca2þ-

dependence of BK currents can be explained. Although further

analysis may reveal some linkage between the allosteric effects

mediated by each regulatory element, it is remarkable that the

assumption of independence in the allosteric effects of three distinct

regulatory elements accounts so well for the observations. In fact, to

account for the broad range of [Ca2þ]i regulated, independence of each of the

over which BK channels are Ca2þ-dependent regulatory

elements is required. This deﬁnition of the principal regulatory elements by which Ca2þ controls activation of BK currents provides a critical step towards deﬁning how the binding of Ca2þ may

modulate channel activation.

A

Methods
Generation and expression of mutant subunits Disruption of the Ca2þ bowl region was accomplished with mutation of ﬁve consecutive aspartate residues to asparagines (5D5N; mSlo1 residues 898-902)9. Loci for mutational analysis of the RCK domain were guided by a comparison of Slo1 and Slo3 sequences in or near the region between b-sheet bA and helix aA (Fig. 1c) deﬁned in the published crystal structure of the Escherichia coli Kþ homologue12. For structural comparisons, the Slo1 amino acid sequence was threaded onto the published structure of the RCK domain of the E. coli Kþ channel12. Because of the absence of residues in the linker between helix aA and sheet bB in the E. coli sequence, the position of residues in this linker shown in the diagram of the BK RCK structure (Fig. 1b) is uncertain.
Construction of mutations was accomplished using standard procedures29. Methods of expression in Xenopus ooctyes were as previously described5. In addition to mutations involving D362, D367, D369 and E399, a number of other single point mutations involving charged residues in the RCK domain (D481A, D482A, D434A and K448A) were also examined. Similar to wild-type Slo1 currents, each of these constructs exhibit a .250mV negative shift in V 1/2 over Ca2þ from 0 to 100 mM, with little difference in the shape of the pCa versus V 1/2 relationship compared to control currents.
Physiological recordings
All recordings used inside-out patches and follow procedures in standard use in our laboratory5,30. The pipette extracellular solution was 140 mM potassium methanesulphonate, 20 mM KOH, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.0). Test solutions bathing the cytoplasmic face of the patch membrane contained 140 mM potassium methanesulphonate, 20 mM KOH, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), and one of the following:

5 mM EGTA (for nominally 0 Ca2þ, 0.5 and 1 mM Ca2þ solutions), 5 mM HEDTA (for 4 and 10 mM Ca2þ solutions), or no added Ca2þ buffer (for 30 mM and higher Ca2þ). The
methods of calibration and preparation of Mg2þ solutions have been described

previously5,30. Excised patches were bathed with constantly ﬂowing solutions of deﬁned Ca2þ from a multibarrel local application system.

Conductance–voltage (G–V) curves were generated from tail currents following

standard procedures5. Families of G–V curves represent averages from a set of patches at speciﬁc [Ca2þ]i. For each patch, G–V curves were ﬁt with

GðV Þ ¼ Gmax=ð1 þ expðV2V1=2Þ=kÞ

ð1Þ

to provide estimates of V 1/2, the voltage of half activation, and k, the slope factor describing the voltage-dependence of the closed–open equilibrium. Estimates of the V 1/2 value for a given ionic condition represent the mean value for a set of ﬁve to ten individual patches. In all cases, error bars show s.e.m. In Fig. 3, for comparison of the magnitude of V 1/2 shifts, V 1/2 values for each construct were adjusted so that the values at 0 mM were identical. For all constructs, absolute V 1/2 values at 0 mM ranged from within about 20 mV, a range similar to that observed for different sets of patches from the same construct. Experiments were at room temperature (21–24 8C). Most salts and chemicals were from Sigma.

Allosteric models of BK current activation

For an allosteric model in which membrane voltage and one or more distinct ligand-

binding sites all independently regulate the transition between closed and open

conformations, the energy provided by each regulatory site is additive in activating the

channel7. Such a model predicts that the shift in V 1/2 for a single divalent cation-binding site follows the following relationship for the case that there is one Ca2þ-binding site on

each of the four BK a-subunits5,13.

where V 1/2(0) corresponds to activation V 1/2 at 0 Ca2þ, KC1 and KO1 correspond to the Ca2þ afﬁnity of the closed and open channel, respectively, k is Boltzmann’s constant and T

is absolute temperature. For three distinct, independent regulatory elements, V 1/2 is

Thus, the shift in V 1/2 for each regulatory element is additive with the contributions of the

Estimates for Ca2þ binding afﬁnities were: for the Ca2þ bowl, KC1 ¼ 4:5 ^ 1:7 mM and KO1 ¼ 2:0 ^ 0:7 mM; for D362/D367, KC2 ¼ 17:2 ^ 4:0 mM and KO2 ¼ 4:6 ^ 1:0 mM; and for E399, KC3 ¼ 4:1 ^ 3:5 mM and KO3 ¼ 1:8 ^ 1:2 mM: With mutation to D362A/D367A, KC2 ¼ 6.6 mM and KO2 ¼ 10.7 mM, accounting for the inhibitory effects of Ca2þ. Values above 10 mM
were not included in the ﬁt.

A bacteriolytic agent that detects and kills Bacillus anthracis

The dormant and durable spore form of Bacillus anthracis is an ideal biological weapon of mass destruction1,2. Once inhaled, spores are transported by alveolar macrophages to lymph nodes surrounding the lungs, where they germinate; subsequent vegetative expansion causes an overwhelming ﬂood of bacteria and toxins into the blood, killing up to 99% of untreated victims. Natural and genetically engineered antibiotic-resistant bacilli amplify the threat of spores being used as weapons, and heighten the need for improved treatments and spore-detection methods after an intentional release. We exploited the inherent binding speciﬁcity and lytic action of bacteriophage enzymes called lysins for the rapid detection and killing of B. anthracis. Here we show that the PlyG lysin, isolated from the g phage of B. anthracis,

speciﬁcally kills B. anthracis isolates and other members of the B. anthracis ‘cluster’ of bacilli in vitro and in vivo. Both vegetative cells and germinating spores are susceptible. The lytic speciﬁcity of PlyG was also exploited as part of a rapid method for the identiﬁcation of B. anthracis. We conclude that PlyG is a tool for the treatment and detection of B. anthracis.
Bacteriophage lysins are lytic agents used by double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages to coordinate bacterial host lysis with completion of viral assembly3,4. Late in infection, lysin translocates from the cytoplasm into the cell-wall matrix, where it rapidly hydrolyses covalent bonds essential for peptidoglycan integrity, causing bacterial lysis and concomitant release of progeny phages. Lysin family members are often chimaeric proteins, consisting of a usually well-conserved catalytic domain fused to a largely divergent speciﬁcity or binding domain4,5. High-afﬁnity binding (the afﬁnity constant KA ¼ 3–6 £ 108; similar to afﬁnity-matured antibodies) is directed towards species- or strain-speciﬁc cell-wall carbohydrates that are often essential for viability, thus implying that intrinsic lysin resistance could be rare. Lysins have not previously been investigated as a means for bacterial control, although we have demonstrated efﬁcient ‘lysis from without’ of pathogenic streptococci in the mouse nasopharynx using puriﬁed streptococcal phage lysins6,7. On the basis of these ﬁndings, we thought that lysins might be able to deliver a rapid and speciﬁc lethal action to any particular bacterial pathogen, not just streptococci. The main requirement for developing lysins, as such, is a dsDNA phage speciﬁc for the pathogen of interest to serve as a lysin source. We investigated this possibility with a dsDNA phage speciﬁc for the biowarfare agent B. anthracis.
The dsDNA phages of B. anthracis form a homogeneous family8. We chose the g phage as a lysin source because of its speciﬁcity for B. anthracis and its usage by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, Georgia) for identiﬁcation of this pathogen2,9. It is known that g phages infect most B. anthracis isolates, including some rare Bacillus cereus strains that could represent B. anthracis cured of its virulence plasmid or an environmental reservoir of potential progenitors10. Isolates of RSVF1 (streptomycin-resistant B. cereus strain 4342 from the American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) and B. anthracis are monomorphic at multiple allozyme loci, and therefore are part of the same highly related cluster of isolates within the B. cereus lineage11. Consistent with this, we found that RSVF1 was sensitive to the g phage (Table 1) and displayed several other features typical of B. anthracis: matt colony morphology, ﬁlamentous structure, lack of motility, and characteristic sequences in the hypervariable vrrA locus (data not shown). For these reasons, RSVF1 is an appropriate representative of the g-phage-sensitive B. anthracis cluster of B. cereus for use in this study.
An expression library of g phage proteins was screened for agents capable of lysing RSVF1 ‘from without’. Each lytic clone identiﬁed contained a 702-base-pair (bp) g open reading frame (ORF) encoding a product that is homologous to N-acetylmuramoyl-Lalanine amidases (amidases), a class of phage lysins (Fig. 1a). The homology was restricted to the catalytic amino-terminal halves, and absent in the cell-wall-speciﬁc carboxy-terminal binding domains4,5. Recombinant g lysin (called PlyG, for phage lysin g) was puriﬁed to homogeneity by column chromatography (Fig. 1b). Gel ﬁltration conﬁrmed a predicted relative molecular mass of about 27,000 (M r 27K), and suggested that PlyG acts as a monomer and is not proteolytically processed.
To evaluate activity and speciﬁcity, 0.5 U of PlyG was initially added in drops to bacterial lawns of RSVF1 (Fig. 1c) and isolates of B. anthracis gathered worldwide as well as other bacilli from the B. cereus lineage (B. cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis) and other Grampositive genera (Table 1). RSVF1 was the only B. cereus strain found to be as sensitive to PlyG killing (and sensitive to the g phage) as the diverse set of B. anthracis isolates (Table 1). B. cereus ATCC 10987, a strain closely related to B. anthracis11, was slightly susceptible to
