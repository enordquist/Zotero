Liping Wen1 and Lei Jiang1,2,∗

ABSTRACT
In this review, we focus on the confined water that exists in one-dimensional micro/nano composite structures, particularly inside biological nanochannels. Using these nanochannels as inspiration, we discuss a strategy for the design and construction of biomimetic smart nanochannels. Unique features of the inner surfaces of a nanochannel’s wall have similar properties to living systems. Importantly, the abiotic analogs have potential applications in, for example, sensing, energy conversion and filtering.
Keywords: confined water, micro/nano structures, nanochannel

INTRODUCTION
Wettability is a fundamental property of a solid surface [1–3]. Many examples of controlled wettability can be found in the natural world, for example, the self-cleaning lotus leaf [4], the anisotropic de-wetting of rice leaves [5], the superhydrophobic forces generated by a water strider’s leg [6] and the fog collector on the desert beetle’s back [7]. These natural surfaces have inspired researchers to design and fabricate functional interfacial materials that can control wettability by changing the topographic structures and chemical composition of surfaces [8–10]. Although most research has investigated two-dimensional surfaces, the attention is now being paid to the engineering and fabrication of one-dimensional (1D) materials such as nanowires, nanofibers, and nanorods that can control wettability [11–15]. Most researchers investigate the outer interfaces and not the inner surfaces of 1D nanochannels. This study considers the recent progress in the construction and application of biomimetic smart nanochannels.
Biological ion channels are membrane protein complexes that open and close in response to external stimuli and regulate ion transport across cell membranes. They are similar to nanopores, but with a depth much larger than their diameters [16]. They are significant for the implementation of various important physiological functions [17– 19]. However, such nanochannels and their em-

bedding lipid bilayers are susceptible to deterioration, if there are changes to external environmental factors such as pH, temperature and mechanical stress. To overcome these drawbacks, much effort has been devoted to the development of artificial nanochannels, which emerged as ‘abiotic’ analogs to mimic the function of biological nanochannels [20– 23]. Recently, researchers have succeeded in generating solid-state artificial nanochannels. Synthetic nanochannels have similar functions to biological ion channels, but are more stable, so there are many possible applications [24] that include sensing [25– 27], energy conversion [28–30] and filtration [31– 34].
This review is organized into five sections (Fig. 1). The first section gives a brief introduction to the confined water in nanochannel systems. The second section is a comprehensive overview of the design and construction of biomimetic nanochannels and includes a discussion of the materials, fabrication procedures and modification methods. The third section presents the properties of biomimetic nanochannels, and the fourth section discusses their applications. Our conclusions are in the final section.

materials and devices whose functions are similar to living systems. It considers topics such as bionic principles, bionic structures and bionic functions. We will now summarize the construction techniques of some synthetic nanochannels and discuss the materials, fabrication techniques and ionic transport properties.
Materials and techniques
The fragile and deteriorative properties of biological nanochannels have encouraged the emergence of solid-state synthetic nanochannels. Specific application requirements influence the selection of the various materials and fabrication technologies that prepare the nanochannels (Fig. 2). Popular methods use ion or electron beams to create single nanochannels in silicon nitride [35,36], silicon oxide [37] and graphene membranes [38,39]. Furthermore, other methods such as self-assembly [40,41], electrochemical etching [42], anodic oxidation [43] and laser technology [44] are used according to different materials and application requirements. Ion track-etch polymer membranes are also used to prepare solid-state nanochannels [45,46]. Before etching, polymer membranes should be irradiated with heavy ions, which can create damage zones on the polymer membranes. The shapes and structures depend on how much faster the track is etched in comparison to the bulk materials that are removed isotropically during the process [15]. Commonly used polymers are polyethylene terephthalate, polyimide (PI) and polycarbonate. Directly prepared solid-state nanochannels cannot respond to exter-

Smart materials and Functionalization
In our strategy, we considered two routes for the design and preparation of biomimetic smart nanochannels: (i) a direct fabrication of smart nanochannels with the functional materials and (ii) an indirect method, where the functional molecules and materials on the inner surfaces of fabricated nanochannels are modified. Both methods require smart molecules and materials. Table 1 lists some smart molecules: pH, ion, temperature, photo, ligand and electro-responsive molecules. Fig. 3 lists some popular modification approaches that were reported by the groups of Jiang [48–50], Azzaroni [51,52], Martin [53] and Siwy [54]. Self-assembled monolayers from smart molecules with proper functionalities have also been used for surface modification. Smart nanochannels can be prepared depending on the engineering, synthesis and combination of these smart materials with the synthesis solid-state nanochannels.
PROPERTIES AND INFLUENCE FACTORS OF BIOMIMETIC SMART NANOCHANNELS
Naturally occurring 1D micro/nano composite structures have unique properties that have inspired researchers. Bioinspired materials and devices are attracting increasing interest because of their similarities to living systems, and they can be used in many applications. In this section, we list some properties of biomimetic nanochannels including ionic selectivity, ion current rectification and gating [82]. Most of these properties can be controlled by changing the geometry, type and distribution of surface charge, chemical composition or wettability [13,15]. These factors can directly affect the function of the nanochannel.
Ionic selectivity
Ion selectivity is a functional characteristic of biological ion channels that precisely controls the transport of ions across the cell membrane. Biological ion channels achieve selectivity by requiring the dimension of the ionic filter to match the volume of the passing ions with subatomic precision [83]. Thus, this is difficult to directly replicate in artificial systems. Taking inspiration from the selectivity of biological ion channels, smart

molecules or functional groups can be modified, so that they interact with special chemical species and are less dependent on the exact pore dimensions of the inner surfaces of synthetic nanochannels. Following this principle, many ions and molecules can be bound to the functionalized inner surface, which can change its properties such as chemical composition, surface charge, wettability and structure. All of these factors can directly influence the transport of the ion current. For example, Jiang et al. developed a potassium-sensitive nanochannel using conformational changes of G4 DNA chains (Fig. 4A) [66]. Their system showed a nonlinear response to K+ at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1500 mm, which is different from the ionic current

that was measured in the unaltered nanochannels. This reaction can be attributed to the change of the G4 DNA chains from a loose packing strand to an i-motif structure after binding with K+, which leads to a decrease in the effective pore size and a decrease in the current. This type of system could also be used to detect Zn2+ or Hg2+ by substituting the potassium-sensitive G4 DNA with zinc activated peptides [69] or single stranded DNA with thymine bases [71]. In addition to ions [67], functionalized artificial nanochannels can also detect organic molecules (Fig. 4B–D) [53,68,84], inorganic molecules (Fig. 4F) [72,85,86] and biomolecules such as DNA [40,87–89], proteins [90–92] and nanoparticles (Fig. 4E) [93]. Therefore, it is

possible to build sensor and filter systems by harnessing interactions between chemical species and smart molecules on the pore walls, which changes the inner surface’s properties to control ionic transport.
Ionic rectification
Biological ion channels can accurately control the ion flow through cell membranes using asymmetrically distributed protein complexes [94]. Inspired by these features, artificial analogs with structural or chemical asymmetries can be developed. In principle, a nanopore with a permanent surface charge could rectify an ionic current if one side of the nanopore was geometrically larger than the other, and the diameter of the small side was comparable to the Debye layer length [42,45,95–97]. The following three conditions are necessary for this recti-

fication. First, the structural asymmetric nanochannel [98] should be prepared, and the diameter of the small opening should be comparable to the length of the Debye layer. Second, surface charges should exist on the inner surface’s wall. Finally, interactions between ions and the channel walls should be asymmetric at the two entrances of the channels [42]. The rectification can be realized in geometrical asymmetric nanochannels by changing the surface charge. As shown in Fig. 5A, Siwy et al. prepared a novel device based on a single conical polymeric nanochannel, whose surfaces generate a sharp boundary between the positive and negative regions [98]. The device showed a much higher rectification than that generated using surface charges and was similar to that of semiconductor bipolar diodes. These surface charges can be realized by modifying smart molecules [60,61] and sputter metal coatings [81,99–101]. The geometric

structure can also control the rectification. A symmetric nanochannel with fixed surface charge has a linear I–V curve [102]. However, asymmetric geometrical nanochannels can have rectifying ionic currents, although they have the same surface compositions. A ratchet model was proposed, based on a negative surface charge and an asymmetric geometry. As shown in Fig. 5B, for positive voltages, an electrostatic cation trap was formed and lowered the conductivity. However, for negative voltages, no cation trap was created, so higher ion currents were obtained [100]. In low-strength ionic so-

lutions, ionic rectification that occurs in conically shaped nanopores is dependent on the rate of the electrolyte flow through the nanopore (Fig. 5C) [103]. The pressure rectification is due to the disruption of anion and cation distributions at equilibrium within the nanopore whose radius was around 200 nm, but not in a smaller nanopore with a radius of ∼30 nm. This rectification is also dependent on the salt concentration when using the same asymmetric geometric nanochannel. For example, Wei et al. developed a single nanopipette electrode that had different ion-transport properties for KCl

solutions of different concentrations (Fig. 5D) [104]. For 1 M KCl, the current was linear with respect to voltage. However, the ionic rectification current was found when KCl concentrations were 0.1 M or less. This may be because the surface charge was different in the geometrical asymmetric nanochannel. Such a difference can lead to asymmetric interactions between the negatively charged surface and the cations at the two entrances of the nanopipette electrode, which rectify the ionic current.

Ionic gating
As abiotic analogs to biological ion channels, biomimetic smart nanochannels can open and close in response to external stimuli, which is referred to as gating [18,106]. Gating is controlled by properties of the inner surface including blockage [77,78], surface charge distribution [51,100,106], wettability [107,108] and geometry [45,75]. In some cases, gating can be simultaneously influenced by many factors [48,49,51,61,109]. For example,

Siwy et al. developed a blockage controlled gating that used DNA-modified single conical polymeric nanochannels and applied potential [77]. At a positive voltage (anode facing the large opening side of nanochannel), DNA enters the small opening side of a channel, which partially occludes the pathway for ion transport and results in an ‘OFF’ state. At a negative voltage, however, the DNA chains do not enter the small opening of the nanochannel and there is a high ion conductance (Fig. 6A). Smart polymers that undergo conformational transitions can also be introduced into conically shaped nanochannels to realize the gating property. Both Azzaroni [73] and Jiang [74] have demonstrated a thermally nanoactuated gate based on temperature-induced conformational transitions of polymer brushes. Be-

low the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the thermo-responsive polymer, the brushes are in a swollen stage. Because this leads to a decrease in the effective pore size and low conductance of the nanochannel, it is the ‘OFF’ state (Fig. 6B). Increasing the temperature above the LCST causes the polymer brushes to be in a collapsed state, resulting in a larger effective pore size. This produces a higher ionic conductance, and is, therefore, the ‘ON’ state. As ion translocation is always mediated by an aqueous solution, the wettability of the interior surfaces plays an important role in ion-transport properties [107,108]. Both of these gating methods were controlled by the blockage and wettability of a thermo-responsive polymer. In some nanochannel systems, gating could be realized by incorporating a

series of factors such as surface charge distribution, blockage and geometry, as shown in Fig. 6C–F [48,49,61].
APPLICATIONS
As biomimetic smart nanochannels have similar properties to biological nanochannels (such as gating, selectivity, and rectification), they have the potential be used in sensors [25,26,72,79,110,111], energy conversion [12,28–30,112–115], filtration [32,34,116–120] and many other areas [121,122]. For example, functionalized nanochannel materials could detect many chemical and biological species by measuring ion transportation properties. They have the potential to detect neutral molecules such as porphyrin [53], H2O2 [85] and glucose [70], ions such as potassium [66], zinc [69] and mercury [71], protons [48], and large molecules such as DNA and proteins (Fig. 7A–C) [123,124]. A series of energy generation devices have been constructed using functionalized nanochannels in an electro cell that can be driven by pressure (Fig. 7D) [114], photoinduced chemicals (Fig. 7E) [29] and concentration gradients (Fig. 7F) [125]. Fabricated nanochannel films can also be used to filter chemical species such as cations, anions and neutral molecules (Fig. 7G) [33]. Jiang et al. have developed a bio-inspired smart single ion pump using a unique cooperative pH responsive double-gate nanochannel (Fig. 7H) [121]. Specifically, two separate acid and base stimuliresponsive molecules were immobilized on the small sides of a single cigar-shaped nanochannel, which could open and close alternately/simultaneously under symmetric and asymmetric pH stimuli. This system successfully mimics the cooperative response double gates of biological ion pumps. Furthermore, the artificial nanochannel has also been used to construct a device that can hold a motor for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis [122].
CONCLUSIONS
This review has given a brief introduction of recent progress on 1D micro/nano composite structures for confined water, such as ion asymmetric transportation inside biomimetic smart nanochannels. A strategy for the design and construction of these 1D nano composite structures was proposed, and we presented examples of biomimetic smart nanochannels that can respond to external stimuli, such as pH, ions, temperature, electric and light. Furthermore, we summarized nanochannel properties such as selectivity, rectification and gating. These properties can be realized by changing the surface’s ge-

ometry, charge distribution, chemical composition or wettability. Using these properties, these 1D micro/nano composite structures have been applied to many real-world tasks including sensing, energy conversion and filtering.
Although there has been much research into confined water on 1D micro/nano composite structures, much more is necessary because some complex living systems remain unintelligible and, therefore, cannot be easily emulated. It is expected that functional and stable analogs will be developed in the future, which can be used in practical applications, such as energy conversion systems and the separation of water from electrolytes to solve water shortages.
