Alcohols are important products in chemical industry, but separating them from their aqueous solutions is very difﬁcult due to the hydrophilic nature of alcohols. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, we observe a striking nanoscale drying phenomenon and suggest an energy-saving and efﬁcient approach toward alcohol/water separation by using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). We use various common linear alcohols including C1-C6 1-alcohols and glycerol for demonstration (the phenol is also used as comparison). Our simulations show that when SWNTs are immersed in aqueous alcohols solutions, although the alcohols concentration is low (1 M), all kinds of alcohols can induce dehydration (drying) of nanotubes and accumulate inside wide [(13, 13)] and narrow [(6, 6) or (7, 7)] SWNTs. In particular, most kinds of alcohols inside the narrow SWNTs form nearly uniform 1D molecular wires. Detailed energetic analyses reveal that the preferential adsorption of alcohols over water inside nanotubes is attributed to the stronger dispersion interactions of alcohols with SWNTs than water. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that for the wide SWNT, the selectivity for 1-alcohols increases with the number of alcohol’s carbon atoms (Ncarbon) and exhibits an exponential law with respect to Ncarbon for C1-C5 1-alcohols; for narrow SWNTs, the selectivity for 1-alcohols is very high for methanol, ethanol, and propanol, and reaches a maximum when Ncarbon = 3. The underlying physical mechanisms and the implications of these observations for alcohol/water separation are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Alcohols are important products in chemical industry. However, separation of alcohols from their aqueous solution is very difﬁcult due to the hydrophilic nature of alcohols. Conventionally, the alcohol/water separation requires a distillation step1 which is quite energy intensive and expensive. For example, distillation was estimated to consume more than half of the total energy in the production of ethanol from fermentation broth.2 In recent years, several new technologies, such as pervaporation,3,4 gas stripping,5 and adsorption onto zeolites,6,7 have been proposed as alternative approaches for dehydration of aqueous alcohols. In this paper, on the basis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observe a striking nanoscale drying phenomenon8–13 and suggest a new approach toward efﬁcient alcohol/water separation.
Herein, we have chosen single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to realize alcohol/water separation. The carbon nanotubes possess well-deﬁned hollow structures and, thus, serve as desirable materials for molecules adsorbing into their interiors.14–19 Recently, it has been proposed that the SWNTs (or SWNT bundles/membranes) can be used to separate water from salt solution,20 separate binary mixture of organic

(or gas) molecules,21,22 and separate hydrophobic molecules, such as gases (H2, O2, and CO2)23 and methane,24 from their aqueous solutions. In theory, the accumulation of hydrophobic molecules inside SWNTs is not too unexpected in view of the hydrophobic interactions (carbon nanotubes are hydrophobic as well). Interestingly, however, in previous studies25–27 we found that even urea, a hydrophilic molecule, can spontaneously expel water out of SWNTs (induce drying of the SWNTs) and accumulate inside SWNTs due to the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with SWNTs. Inspired by these ﬁndings, in this paper, we investigate whether SWNTs can be used to separate alcohols, which are also hydrophilic, from their aqueous solutions. We note here that, the selective adsorptions of methanol28,29 and ethanol30,31 over water onto SWNTs’ inner surfaces had been recently observed by some researchers through computer simulations. However, a systematic investigation of adsorption of alcohols inside SWNTs is still lacking, and the physical mechanism underlying the aforementioned selective adsorption of alcohols inside nanotubes is still not very clear.
In current simulations, SWNTs are initially immersed in various alcohols solutions (i.e., binary mixture of alcohol and water) to investigate the adsorption behaviors of alcohols inside the hydrophobic nanotubes. Here, we use wide [(13, 13)] and narrow [(6, 6) or (7, 7)] SWNTs, and various alcohols,

including glycerol and a series of 1-alcohols from methanol to hexanol, for demonstration; phenol is also used as comparison. Although the concentration of alcohols/phenol is low (∼1 M), for both wide and narrow SWNTs, all kinds of alcohols and phenol induce dehydration (drying) of nanotubes and accumulate inside the SWNTs. In particular, most kinds of alcohols and phenol inside the narrow nanotubes form nearly uniform 1D molecular wires. Energetic analyses reveal that alcohols have stronger dispersion interactions with SWNTs than water which results in the selective adsorption of alcohols over water inside SWNTs. Furthermore, we compare the selectivity of SWNTs to different alcohols, and compare the selectivity for wide and narrow SWNTs. Interestingly, the selectivity for C1-C5 1-alcohols inside the wide SWNT with respect to the number of alcohol’s carbon atoms (Ncarbon) can be well ﬁtted to an exponential function. The underlying physical mechanisms and the implications for alcohol/water separation are discussed. Our ﬁndings suggest that we might use SWNT bundles/membranes to achieve efﬁcient dehydration of aqueous alcohols (and other hydrophilic organic molecules).
II. SYSTEM AND METHODS
The armchair (13, 13) SWNT, which is 1.74 nm in diameter and 3.03 nm in length, was used in current simulations and referred as to the “wide SWNT.” The initial side length of cubic box for the wide SWNT system was 5.55 nm. We also used the “narrow SWNT” – (6, 6) or (7, 7) SWNT, which is the narrowest armchair SWNT that the alcohols/phenol can penetrate into. For methanol and ethanol, the “narrow SWNT” is the (6, 6) SWNT (0.80 nm in diameter), and the sizes of initial simulation box are 3.75, 3.75, and 5.69 nm; for other kinds of alcohols and phenol, the “narrow SWNT” is the (7, 7) SWNT (0.94 nm in diameter), and the sizes of initial simulation box are 3.88, 3.88, and 5.69 nm. The lengths of (6, 6) and (7, 7) SWNTs are the same (3.27 nm).
Each SWNT was separately solvated in aqueous alcohols/phenol solutions at a concentration of 1 M (see Fig. 1), and was aligned along the z-axis and positioned at the central region of the solvation box. The simulation systems of the ternary mixture (alcohol-water-SWNT) were prepared as follows: First, the organic molecules were randomly placed in the solvated box. Here, the numbers of organic and water molecules in the given simulation boxes were calculated according to the experimentally determined partial molar volumes of organic molecules (at a concentration of 1 M)32 and water33 at 298 K. We used the TIP3P water model,34 and OPLSAA force ﬁeld35 which was commonly used for simulations of organic molecules especially linear alcohols.16,29,36,37 Second, the energies of the binary solution systems were minimized with a steepest descent algorithm, followed by a 1ns NPT equilibration at 298 K. Third, the SWNT was inserted in the equilibrated binary solution, with water/organic molecules removed if the distance between oxygen of water and any carbon atom of SWNT was <2.7 Å, or if the distance between any heavy atom of alcohols/phenol and any carbon atom of SWNT was <2.4 Å.38 The resulting concentrations of aqueous solutions are also roughly 1 M, with the number of

All MD simulations were performed using GROMCAS 4.0.741 in an NPT (298 K, 1 atm) ensemble with periodic boundary conditions applied in all directions. The constant temperature and pressure were maintained using the v-rescale thermostat42 (with a coupling coefﬁcient of τ T = 0.5 ps) and the Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling scheme43 (with a coupling coefﬁcient of τ p = 5 ps), respectively. The particlemesh Ewald method44 with a real space cutoff of 1.0 nm was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions, whereas the vdW interactions were treated with a cutoff distance of 1.2 nm. LINCS was applied to constrain all bonds. A time step of 2.0 fs was used, and the data were collected every 1 ps. The simulation lengths were 150 ns for methanol-(6, 6) SWNT system and 100 ns for other systems.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Alcohol-induced drying for wide SWNT systems

In the following, we show that the alcohols win the competitive adsorption over water inside SWNTs and induce drying of SWNTs. First, we have calculated the number of solvent molecules (water/alcohols/phenol) inside the (13, 13) SWNTs during the course of MD simulations, as shown in Fig. 2. Here, a solvent molecule is deﬁned as being inside the SWNT once its center of mass enters the SWNT. The corresponding snapshots of the alcohol-water mixtures inside the nanotubes, after the systems have reached equilibrium, are also shown in the insets of Fig. 2. Strikingly, in all cases except methanol, most water molecules initially inside the SWNTs (the concentrations of alcohols/phenol inside the SWNTs are also roughly 1 M from the initial solvation setup) are expelled out from the SWNTs. Eventually, the SWNT interiors are dominantly occupied by the alcohols/phenol. The drying effects for C4-C6 1-alcohols and phenol are so strong that almost all water molecules initially inside the SWNTs are expelled out after the systems have reached equilibrium. It should be noted that, in the case of methanol, although the number of water molecules remaining inside SWNT is still large, the ratio of number of methanol to water inside SWNT is several times larger than that in bulk (more below). That is, it can be viewed that methanol also induces drying of SWNT and accumulates inside SWNT. In addition, we have calculated the average number of alcohols/phenol and water molecules within (13, 13) SWNTs in equilibrium. The results are summarized in Table II.
To quantify the drying effect and the selectivity of SWNTs to different alcohols, we have calculated the “selectivity” of a SWNT to alcohols (or phenol)22,30,45 (i.e., the “drying factor” in our previous paper26), fselec, deﬁned as follows:

fselec = RSWNT/Rbulk,

(1)

where RSWNT and Rbulk are the ratio of the average number of alcohols/phenol to water in SWNT and that in the bulk region, respectively. A larger fselec means a higher selectivity (i.e., stronger drying effect) for alcohols/phenol. The com-

puted fselec are presented in Table II, and the relationship between fselec and Ncarbon is plotted in Fig. 3. It is clear that the fselec increase as Ncarbon increases for 1-alcohols. More interestingly, when Ncarbon ≤ 5, the fselec can be ﬁtted to an exponential function with respect to Ncarbon very well,

fselec = 3.60 × exp(Ncarbon/0.91) + 3.25.

(2)

When Ncarbon ≥ 5, the fselec seems to be saturated, because at those times almost no water can enter the nanotube (the average number of water inside SWNT is smaller than 2). Also, note that the fselec for glycerol and phenol are considerably large (39 and 487, respectively), but these values are still smaller than those of 1-propanol and 1-hexanol (they have the same Ncarbon as glycerol and phenol, respectively). The underlying mechanisms will be discussed in Sec. III B.

B. Physical mechanisms of alcohol-induced drying of SWNTs
The observed phenomenon of alcohol-induced drying of SWNTs can be explained from an energetic perspective. Following the pioneering work by Hua et al.38 wherein the preferential binding of urea over water around proteins is interpreted by analyzing the interaction energy distributions of solvents, we have computed the average nonbonded interactions,

including both vdW and electrostatic interactions, for a solvent (alcohols/phenol/water) molecule inside the SWNT and in bulk (deﬁned as 1.2 nm away from any atoms of SWNT for any atoms of the solvent) with the rest of the system. Figure 4 shows the interaction energy distributions of a solvent in (13, 13) SWNT and in bulk (the data are averaged over the ﬁrst 10 ns of simulations), using the ethanol case for demonstration (the distributions for other cases are similar). Compared to a bulk ethanol, the energy distribution of a conﬁned ethanol shifts rightward (peak position shifting ∼2.2 kcal/mol toward the high energy region) in the electrostatic term whereas shifts leftward (peak position shifting ∼5.0 kcal/mol toward the low energy region) in the vdW term, with the leftward shifting more noticeable. There are similar shifting tendencies for water moving from bulk to SWNT, but the leftward shifting in vdW energy is much less noticeable than that of ethanol.

Thus, when a solvent moves from bulk region into SWNT, ethanol’s gains in vdW energy can (over)compensate the loss in electrostatic energy, whereas water’s gains in vdW energy cannot, resulting in the binding preference of ethanol over water inside the SWNT.
Table III summarizes the differences in the average interaction energies for a solvent in the SWNT and in bulk. In all cases, as a bulk alcohol (or phenol) moves into SWNT, it loses electrostatic interaction energy; however, the conﬁned alcohol (or phenol) gains considerable vdW interaction energy due to its strong dispersion interaction with the nanotube, which overcompensates the loss in electrostatic interaction. On the other hand, in all cases, a water molecule moving from bulk to SWNT gains a few vdW energies but loses more electrostatic energies. Overall, the changes in total interaction energies are negative for alcohols/phenol but

positive for water when penetrating into SWNTs, which is responsible for the alcohols’ preferential binding over water into the SWNT. Thus, this interaction-energy-decomposition analysis shows higher afﬁnities of alcohols/phenol than water to the SWNTs as a result of stronger dispersion interactions of alcohols/phenol than water with hydrophobic nanotubes, consistent with previous MD studies10,46 which also demonstrated that the attractive dispersion interaction is a very important factor for the occurrence of drying transition in the nano-sized conﬁned region. It should be noted that the replacement of structurally conﬁned water molecules by larger alcohols/phenol inside the SWNT is also favorable because of an overall solvent entropy gain. Indeed, our previous study of urea-induced drying of SWNTs shows that the interactionenergy-decomposition analysis is consistent with the freeenergy-decomposition analysis.26
Now we discuss the mechanisms behind the ﬁndings in Fig. 3 according to the calculated energies in Table III. First, Fig. 3 shows that the selective adsorption of 1-alcohols into SWNT becomes more profound as Ncarbon increases. This tendency is due to the fact that the dispersion interactions of alcohols with SWNT, which dominate the total energetic changes when bulk alcohols penetrate into SWNT, increase with the Ncarbon (see Table III). More interestingly, the absolute values of Etootal (and Eoc) in Table III almost increase linearly with respect to Ncarbon (see Fig. S1 in the supplementary material52); this nearly linear tendency may correlate with the exponential function of fselec with Ncarbon when Ncarbon ≤ 5 shown in Fig. 3 (see the related discussions in the supplementary material52). Second, fselec of glycerol is smaller than that of 1-propanol which has the same Ncarbon as the glycerol. The reason is that glycerol has more hydroxyl functional groups than 1-propanol; when it moves from bulk into SWNT, its loss in electrostatic energy is much larger than that of 1-propanol

(although the additional hydroxyl groups gains more vdW energy, this cannot compensate the loss in electrostatic energy). Third, somewhat unexpectedly, we ﬁnd that fselec of 1-hexanol is larger than phenol which has the same Ncarbon as 1-hexanol but enables π -π stacking interaction40,47,48 with the aromatic rings of nanotube. This may be due to the steric effect – phenol has a relatively larger width in the transverse direction than 1-hexanol (as compared to the shorter length in the longitudinal direction), so not all the inner phenol molecules can beneﬁt from the favorable π -π stacking interactions inside the SWNT. In contrast, 1-hexanol possesses a linear, ﬂexible structure, which can better ﬁt the conﬁned region of SWNT, thus enabling strong dispersion interactions with SWNT and with themselves (the absolute values of Eoc, EvodW , and
Etootal of 1-hexanol are all larger than those of phenol; see Table III).
C. Alcohol-induced drying for narrow SWNT systems
In addition to wide SWNT systems, we have also investigated the drying phenomenon for narrow [(6, 6) and (7, 7)] SWNTs. Here the “narrow SWNT” means the narrowest armchair SWNT that the alcohols/phenol can penetrate into. Our simulations show that the “narrow SWNTs” are (6, 6) SWNT for methanol and ethanol and (7, 7) SWNT for other organic molecules used here. Similar to the situations of wide SWNTs, almost all water molecules inside the SWNTs are replaced by alcohols/phenol within the ﬁrst 50 ns (Fig. S2 in the supplementary material52 displays the drying processes). After the systems have reached equilibrium, the inner alcohols/phenol exhibit single-ﬁle arrays, forming “perfect” molecular wires, or occasionally, forming “defective” molecular wires with a very small number of “water defect(s)” (see Fig. 5). In our previous paper,27 we systematically

investigated the structural and dynamical properties of 1D urea wire conﬁned within the narrow SWNT. In that case, the urea wire is formed with a contiguous hydrogen-bonded network which is somewhat different from the currently presented cases. For future studies, it is interesting to explore the unique properties of these 1D alcohols/phenol wires and ﬁnd their potential applications such as the electronic devices for the signal transduction and multiplication at the nanoscale.17, 49, 50
Table IV lists the average number of alcohols/phenol ( Norganics ) and water molecules ( Nwater ) inside the narrow [(6, 6) or (7, 7)] SWNTs after the systems have reached equilibrium. The number of remaining water inside the narrow SWNTs is very small, resulting in very large fselec, particularly for phenol and 1-alcohols with Ncarbon ≤ 3. For 1-alcohols, as the Ncarbon increases, the selectivity of narrow SWNTs to 1-alcohols increases and reaches a maximum when Ncarbon = 3. It is noteworthy that for short-chain linear alcohols (Ncarbon ≤ 3), fselec for narrow SWNT are larger than those for wide [(13, 13)] SWNT; but for long-chain linear alcohols (Ncarbon > 3), fselec for narrow SWNT are smaller than those for wide [(13, 13)] SWNT (see Tables II and IV). These interesting tendencies can be interpreted in terms of the competition between enthalpy (interaction energy) and entropy: for short-chain linear alcohols, the alcohols inside narrow SWNTs can gain more vdW interaction energies with the nanotube wall compared to those inside wide SWNT, so the corresponding fselec are larger; when Ncarbon > 3, however, the penalty in the entropy of linear alcohols inside narrow SWNTs becomes signiﬁcant and dominates the free energy, resulting in relatively smaller fselec as compared to wide SWNT cases. This interpretation can be further validated by the evidence that the fselec for phenol (it has the same Ncarbon as 1-hexanol, but its penalty in entropy when penetrating into the narrow SWNT is smaller than linear alcohols) is much larger than fselec for 1-hexanol inside narrow SWNT (see Table IV). These ﬁndings suggest that for short-chain linear alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and glycerol, we can use the narrow SWNTs to achieve the highest selectivity; while for long-chain linear alcohols, it is better to use wide SWNTs to achieve efﬁcient alcohol/water separation.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we employ MD simulations to investigate the competitive binding/adsorption between various alcohols (or phenol) and water inside SWNTs and unveil the underlying physical mechanisms. We observe that even at a low alcohols/phenol concentration (∼1 M), all kinds of alcohols and phenol can induce drying of nanotubes and accumulate inside both wide [(13, 13)] and narrow [(6, 6) or (7, 7)] SWNTs. In particular, for narrow SWNTs, most kinds of alcohols and phenol form nearly uniform 1D molecular wires under the extreme conﬁnement of SWNTs. Our energetic analyses indicate that the preferential binding of alcohols over water inside SWNTs results from the stronger dispersion interactions of alcohols with SWNTs than water. We ﬁnd that for the wide SWNT, the selectivity for 1-alcohols increases as Ncarbon increases with an exponential function when Ncarbon ≤ 5. For narrow SWNTs, the favorable dispersion interactions of alcohols/phenol with SWNTs lead to a very high selectivity for C1-C3 1-alcohols and phenol; the competition between enthalpy and entropy results in a maximal selectivity for 1-alcohols when Ncarbon = 3. By comparing the selectivity of SWNTs to alcohols between wide and narrow SWNTs, we suggest that to achieve the highest efﬁciency of alcohol/water separation, it is better to use narrow SWNTs to separate short-chain linear alcohols, while using wide SWNTs to separate long-chain linear alcohols. For practical applications, SWNT bundles15 or membranes51 can be used to realize the alcohol/water separation. In view of a previous Monte Carlo simulation30 which indicates that the separation performance of SWNTs with appropriate diameters is better than zeolites, we expect that SWNT may be a more promising adsorbent than the widely used zeolites for alcohol/water separation. Our ﬁndings hold promise for the potential use of SWNT bundles/membranes for efﬁciently extracting alcohols (and other hydrophilic organic molecules) from their aqueous solutions.
