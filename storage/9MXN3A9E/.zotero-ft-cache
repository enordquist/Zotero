Clathrin-coat disassembly illuminates the mechanisms of Hsp70 force generation
Rui Sousa1, Hsien-Shun Liao2,4, Jorge Cuéllar3, Suping Jin1, José M Valpuesta3, Albert J Jin2 & Eileen M Lafer1

Hsp70s use ATP hydrolysis to disrupt protein-protein associations and to move macromolecules. One example is the Hsc70mediated disassembly of the clathrin coats that form on vesicles during endocytosis. Here, we exploited the exceptional features of these coats to test three models—Brownian ratchet, power-stroke and entropic pulling—proposed to explain how Hsp70s transform their substrates. Our data rule out the ratchet and power-stroke models and instead support a collision-pressure mechanism whereby collisions between clathrin-coat walls and Hsc70s drive coats apart. Collision pressure is the complement   to the pulling force described in the entropic pulling model. We also found that self-association augments collision pressure, thereby allowing disassembly of clathrin lattices that have been predicted to be resistant to disassembly. These results illuminate how Hsp70s generate the forces that transform their substrates.

Hsp70s inhibit the formation of nonfunctional protein complexes
and aggregates by sequestering interactive (primarily hydrophobic) segments of both native and misfolded protein substrates1,2. The
conformational changes that allow Hsp70s to alternately bind and release their substrates are understood3–7 but do not explain how Hsp70s disassociate aggregates or complexes8–11, or pull proteins into organelles12,13. In these reactions, Hsp70s move their substrates, either
through translocation pores or away from other proteins. Under the
power-stroke model, Hsp70, during ATP hydrolysis, undergoes a conformational change that pulls on its substrate12. Under the Brownian
ratchet model, Hsp70 asymmetrically traps spontaneous fluctuations that move the substrate in a particular direction14,15. Finally, under the entropic pulling model16,17, Hsp70 recruitment to its substrate results
in an Hsp70 bound to a floppy polypeptide abutting a structural wall
(for example, an aggregate or translocation pore). Movement of Hsp70
away from the wall, dragging the polypeptide substrate with it, is
thermodynamically favored because it increases Hsp70’s freedom of
motion and entropy.
Clathrin uncoating, in which constitutively expressed Hsc70
is recruited to coated vesicles by the J cochaperone auxilin and
then drives coat disassembly into triskelia (trimers of clathrin heavy- and light-chain dimers)2, provides an exceptional system
through which to study how Hsp70s alter their substrates. Clathrincage assembly and disassembly in vitro18 can be precisely monitored in both single-molecule19,20 and ensemble experiments21. Cage stability can be modulated by pH22. Structures of cages and other reaction components have been reported3,23–26, and a single
Hsc70-binding site at the clathrin heavy-chain (CHC) C terminus mediates disassembly27.

We set out to test models of Hsp70 force generation by exploiting these features. Our results do not support the power-stroke or Brownian-ratchet models but instead support the entropic pulling model. They also show that Hsp70 oligomerization, a ubiquitous phenomenon with no known active biological function28–30, augments the force that Hsp70s generate when acting on their substrates.
RESULTS The three models in the context of uncoating
Clathrin-cage disassembly is driven by Hsc70 binding to a sequence (QLMLT) in the flexible CHC C-terminal tail ten residues downstream of each of the three helices at the center of the triskelion under each cage vertex23,27 (Fig. 1a,b). In previous structural studies, it has been proposed that Hsc70 does not induce but instead sterically locks in fluctuations that loosen the clathrin lattice until they accumulate to a point that disassembly ensues23. This Brownian/steric-wedge model can be tested by moving the Hsc70-binding site to relieve steric clashes between the Hsc70 and cage walls. If disassembly were to persist even as steric clashes are relieved, this mechanism would be less plausible.
The entropic pulling model emphasizes thermodynamics—the entropy change—in the reaction16,17, but the complementary molecular kinetic description is collision pressure, in which collisions and repulsion between Hsp70s and closely apposed structural walls impart momentum away from the walls31,32 and to the Hsp70s. Such collisions necessarily generate equal and opposite momentum on the walls. Thus, Hsc70s bound to flexible tethers under each vertex would impart pressure against cage walls and consequently drive the triskelia apart. In contrast to the steric-wedge model, the collision-pressure

mechanism suggests that moving the Hsc70-binding site away from the walls would slow but not stop disassembly and that moving this site by 10 or 25 amino acids (aa) would slow disassembly by ~10- or ~60-fold, respectively17 (Supplementary Note 1).
The collision-pressure and Brownian/steric-wedge models predict that any protein similar in size to Hsc70 and binding at the same location should drive disassembly, whereas the power-stroke model requires an Hsc70-specific conformational change. Therefore, in contrast to the steric wedge and collision-pressure models, the power-stroke mechanism suggests that if the Hsc70-binding site were replaced with an antibody-binding site, the antibody should not drive disassembly.
To test the mutually exclusive predictions of these models, we assembled cages from CHCs in which the Hsc70-binding site was at its wild-type (WT) position (0 aa), or 10 or 25 aa C-terminal to this position (+10 aa and +25 aa; Fig. 1c). We also prepared cages with this site replaced with an antibody-binding site (a FLAG tag) at the WT position, or 10 or 25 aa C-terminal to this position (denoted 0-aa FLAG, +10-aa FLAG and +25-aa FLAG; Fig. 1c).
Moving the Hsc70-binding site slows disassembly
We measured disassembly on the basis of light-scattering in a stoppedflow fluorometer (Supplementary Fig. 1), using cages reacted with varying concentrations of Hsc70. With 0-aa cages, reaction profiles (Fig. 2a) were similar to those seen by Rothnie et al., who have used a similar approach21. The reaction of cages with 2 µM Hsc70 resulted in an initial ~15% increase in scattering, which was followed by a drop to ~20% of the initial level. The large drop was due to disassembly21,24. The nature of the initial smaller increase is unknown but was assigned by Rothnie et al. to the binding of the first Hsc70 to one of the three CHC termini in their sequential mechanism, in which three Hsc70s must bind all three sites in a triskelion before that triskelion is released from the cage. A subsequent single-molecule study has cast doubt over this mechanism by showing that disassembly begins when only one or even fewer20 Hsc70s are bound for every two triskelia, and that Hsc70s continue to bind and accelerate disassembly even after disassembly had begun19.
We attempted to fit our data by using the sequential scheme described Rothnie et al. but concluded that neither the amplitude of the initial increase in scattering nor the rates of this initial increase or subsequent decrease could be accurately determined, because these parameters are coupled (Supplementary Fig. 2). We therefore used the simplest possible scheme: C + H → CH → T, where C, H and T correspond to cages, Hsc70 and triskelia, respectively (Supplementary Note 2) to fit values for the rate of Hsc70 association (ka), the amplitude of scattering from the intermediate (CH) and the cage-disassembly rate (kd). However, because these parameters are coupled, we did not ascribe meaning to these values but instead derived a parameter that was independent of the amplitude of the intermediate and incorporated both the association and disassembly rates: kov = 1/(1/([Hsc70] × ka)+1/kd)), in which square brackets denote concentration. This equation corresponds to the overall rate of

disassembly (k3+ = 0.105 µM−1 s−1) described by Bocking et al.19. Bocking et al. have concluded that this rate increases linearly with Hsc70 concentration. However, this conclusion is inconsistent with their data, which show large divergence from linearity at Hsc70 concentrations > 1 µM (ref. 19), and also with our data (Fig. 2d–f) and those from Rothnie et al.21, which show hyperbolic kinetics. We therefore fitted overall rates at different Hsc70 concentrations to a hyperbolic equation (Fig. 2d). With 0-aa cages, we obtained a Vmax of 0.11 s−1 with an [Hsc70]1/2Vmax of 0.34 µM, and a rate of 0.065 s−1 at 0.5 µM Hsc70, a result similar to the estimate of 0.053 s−1 with 0.5 µM Hsc70 (a concentration at which divergence from their linear model was small) in Bocking et al.
With +10-aa and +25-aa cages, disassembly was, respectively, twoand four-fold slower than with 0 aa cages (Fig. 2). Disassembly of cages missing the Hsc70-binding site was ~20× slower (Supplementary Fig. 1), thus indicating that disassembly of +10-aa or +25-aa cages was predominately due to Hsc70 binding to the displaced site. The initial scattering increase became larger as the Hsc70-binding site was moved, reaching ~70% of the starting value in reactions with +25-aa cages (Fig. 2c).
Our observation that disassembly slowed by only four-fold even when the Hsc70-binding site was moved 25 aa does not support the Brownian/steric-wedge model but is also inconsistent with the collision-pressure model, which predicts an ~60-fold decrease when the binding site is moved to this extent. We wondered whether this result might be due to Hsc70 self-association28, because the collision-pressure model assumes identical numbers of Hsc70s binding to cages with different tether lengths. We tested this possibility with Hsc70∆C, which is functional in disassembly but bears a C-terminal deletion that decreases self-association33. With Hsc70∆C and 0-aa cages, the maximal disassembly rate was approximately two-fold slower, and the 1/2Vmax concentration was approximately two-fold greater than that with Hsc70 (Fig. 2g). However, with +10-aa and +25-aa cages, disassembly with Hsc70∆C was much slower than with Hsc70 (Fig. 2h,i), and we were not able to determine Vmax because the rates did not plateau over the tested concentration range. Instead, we compared rates at 2 µM Hsc70∆C and obtained values of 0.051 s−1, 0.0078 s−1 and 0.00080s−1 for the 0-aa, +10-aa and +25-aa cages, respectively (Fig. 2g–i and Supplementary Table 1). Thus, with Hsc70∆C, the rate decreases were in agreement with the collision-pressure model. With Hsc70∆C, the initial scattering increase was also smaller than that with Hsc70, reaching a maximum of ~40% (with +25-aa cages; Fig. 2i) but reaching ~70% with Hsc70 (Fig. 2c).

Figure 4  Cryo-EM reconstructions of cages with or without Hsc70∆C or Hsc70. (a) Partially transparent cage image previously reconstructed by Xing et al.23, with difference density attributable to Hsc70∆C ((Cages + Hsc70∆C) − (Cages)) in gold. (b) Partially transparent cage image from our reconstructions, with difference density attributable to Hsc70∆C in red. (c) Partially transparent cage image from our reconstructions, with difference density attributable to Hsc70 in green. In each image, the bulk of the difference density is centered under each cage vertex and highlighted with blue circles. Cage dimensions ± Hsc70∆C or Hsc70 (± 40 Å) are specified under each image. (d–f) Two orthogonal views of the ribbon model of the asymmetric unit of the clathrin cage (PDB 1XI4 (ref. 23)), with the difference density attributable to Hsc70∆C from previous reconstructions (d; gold), our reconstruction with Hsc70∆C (e; red) or our reconstructions with Hsc70 (f; green) shown. The view is from inside the cage centered on a vertex. The Hsc70∆C density is similarly sized and positioned in both our reconstruction and the previous one, and it can accommodate one 25-kDa Hsc70 PBD (docked in the volume; PDB 1DKX48). The Hsc70 density is similarly positioned but is approximately twice as large and is able to accommodate two 25-kDa PBDs (indicated by blue and magenta arrows).

model and validated by our observations of the effects of shifting the Hsc70-binding sites in the clathrin cage, these pushing forces diminish with distance (Fig. 8, step 2). The reaction may stall if this distal Hsp70 sterically blocks loading of another Hsp70 at the more forcefully productive position, near the wall. The role of the NEF in the cycle is to unload the Hsp70 from the nonproductive position (step 3), but high NEF concentrations can be inhibitory if they also begin to unload Hsp70s from productive positions. In addition, if the substrate is recalcitrant and does not yield to the force of single Hsp70s (for example, clathrin cages at pH 6 versus pH 6.8), then the Hsp70 will remain close to the J cochaperone, thus allowing the latter to exploit the self-association properties of the chaperone to load additional Hsp70s onto the first and augment the forces (step 1b). Although this model does not suggest that Hsp110 cannot contribute to disaggregation via other mechanisms47, it can account for the observed Hsp110 concentration dependence and can explain how the established functions of J cochaperones and NEFs in loading and unloading of substrates, respectively, in the Hsp70 chemical cycle, are harnessed in a mechanical cycle that generates the forces by which Hsp70s move and transform their substrates.

ONLINE METHODS DNA constructs. DNA encoding rat clathrin heavy chain 1 (CHC) was PCRamplified from DNA obtained from the Kirchhausen laboratory19 with primer pair 1/2, and cloned into pET28a+ (Novagen). The +10-aa and +25-aa CHC DNAs were constructed by deleting nucleotides encoding the QLMLT sequence by using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). This was accomplished through amplification with primer pair 3/4, then re-addition of the QLMLT coding sequence 10 or 25 aa downstream by using primer pairs 5/6 and 7/8, respectively. CHC FLAG, +10-aa FLAG and +25-aa FLAG DNAs were constructed by replacing the sequence encoding QLMLT in CHC, CHC +10 aa and CHC +25 aa with a sequence encoding DYKDDDDK (FLAG tag), by using primer pairs 9/10, 11/12 and 13/14, respectively (primer sequences in Supplementary Data Set 1). DNA encoding clathrin light chain A1 (CLCA1) was amplified from pPPA1-2 rat LCA1 with primer pair 15/16 and cloned into pBAT4 (EMBL).
Protein expression and purification. BL21(DE3) cells (Agilent) with plasmid encoding histidine-tagged CHC were grown to an OD600 of 1.0 at 30 °C in 2× YT, transferred to 12 °C, induced with IPTG to 1 mM and incubated for 24 h. Cells from 1 L culture were pelleted and resuspended in 50 mL 0.5M Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mM β-ME (lysis buffer) with one Roche protease-inhibitor-cocktail tablet. Cells were lysed by sonication and the addition of 2.5 mL 20% Triton X-100 and were centrifuged at 125,000g for 30 min. Supernatants were loaded onto 20 mL of Ni–NTA agarose (Qiagen), washed with 200 mL lysis buffer and eluted with 100 mL of 0.4 M Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM β-ME and 200 mM imidazole. Protein was precipitated with an equal volume of saturated (NH4)2SO4 and fractionated on a Superpose 6 (GE Healthcare) column in 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA and 3 mM DTT (storage buffer). Pure proteins were concentrated by NH4SO4 precipitation, dialyzed into storage buffer, flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. CLCA1 was coexpressed with histidine-tagged CHC, because expression of CLCA1 alone led to its degradation, and was purified by Ni–NTA agarose as described above. Copurified proteins were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min to precipitate CHC, which was removed by centrifugation. Pure CHC and CLCA1 were mixed 1:1 for use in subsequent experiments. Hsc70 and auxilin(547–910) were prepared as previously described38. AntiFLAG Fab was obtained by digestion of anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma; cat. no. F-1804; lot SLBG5673V) with a mouse IgG1 Fab preparation kit (Thermo). Validation of this monoclonal antibody is provided in ref. 49. For the experiments using anti-histidine Fab, clathrin was purified from clathrin-coated vesicles24 from bovine brains obtained from a commercial slaughterhouse, auxilin(547–910) was prepared by thrombin cleavage of GST-auxilin(547–910)25, and bovine Hsc70 with an N-terminal decahistidine tag was used so that Hsc70 would be the only histidine-tagged protein in the reaction. Anti-histidine Fab was obtained by digestion of anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (Miltenyi cat. no. 130-095-212; antibody GG11-8F3.5.1) with a mouse IgG1 Fab preparation kit (Thermo). Validation of this antibody is provided on the manufacturer’s website.
Clathrin polymerization. CHC and CLCA1 were mixed 1:1 at 4.5 µM in storage buffer and dialyzed against 100 mM MES, pH 6.2, 1.5 mM MgAc2 and 2 mM DTT (polymerization buffer) for 7 h, then dialyzed overnight against 20 mM imidazole, pH 6.8, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgAc2 and 2 mM DTT, or 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM DTT (DTT was omitted from all experiments with Fab). After dialysis, the sample was centrifuged at 9,000g for 10 min to remove aggregated material. EM of cages revealed that cages prepared from recombinant clathrin were indistinguishable from those prepared with clathrin purified from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles (data available upon request).
Stoichiometry of protein binding to cages. Cages polymerized as described above were dialyzed overnight against 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KPO4 and 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, diluted to 0.15 µM CHC and mixed with 0.23 µM histidine-Aux(547–910), 0.5 mM ATP and the indicated concentrations of Hsc70, Hsc70∆C or anti-FLAG Fab. Reactions (200 µl) were centrifuged at 400,000g at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet cages and associated proteins. Pellets were suspended in 75 µl of 1× SDS sample buffer and resolved by denaturing PAGE. Proteins were imaged with a Bio-Rad Criterion Stain Free Imager and quantified with Bio-Rad Image Lab 2.0 software by comparison to lanes in which defined amounts of each protein were loaded. Experiments in which cages were omitted

were run side by side to determine the background pelleting of each protein in the absence of cages. Uncropped images of gels in Figure 5 are presented in Supplementary Data Set 2.
Stopped-flow experiments. Light-scattering experiments were carried out in an Applied Photosystems stopped-flow fluorometer with excitation/emission wavelengths of 395 nm. Cages corresponding to 0.3 µM CHC (unless otherwise indicated in figure legends) with 1 mM ATP and 0.45 µM auxilin in 20 mM imidazole, pH 6.8, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 25 mM KCl and 2 mM MgAc2 or 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 25 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl2 were reacted with an equal volume of 0.04 µM to 8 µM Hsc70 in the same buffer. Background scattering determined from reactions without cages was subtracted from measured scattering values, which were normalized by dividing by the starting scattering value so that the initial scattering in all reactions was 1.0. Measures of scattering by varying concentrations of cages or triskelia showed that scattering was linear with cage or triskelia concentrations over the ranges used in these experiments (Supplementary Fig. 1). As indicated in the figure legends, auxilin and/or ATP were omitted from some reactions to control for the effects of these molecules. Removal of ATP (or substitution with ADP or ATP-γS), auxilin, the Hsc70 NBD, or Hsc70 ATP binding or hydrolysis activity severely slowed or abrogated disassembly (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Atomic force and electron microscopy. QNM peak-force AFM experiments were carried out on a multimode 8-nanoscope V instrument (Bruker) under pH6.0 buffer, with an MSCT cantilever with a calibrated spring constant designed between 0.01 and 0.03 N/m and peak-force set points of 100–200 pN; 5-µl drops of fresh cages with or without auxilin, ATP, and Hsc70 or Hsc70∆C were deposited on freshly peeled mica and imaged under the same buffer after routine optimization for biological AFM. Data were analyzed with instrument software (Nanoscope ver8.15, Bruker) and exported as ascii files for further analysis with Excel (Microsoft) and displayed with ImageJ (version 1.4x, NIH). Samples as described for AFM were absorbed for 20 s to a Formvar-carbon grid, rinsed and incubated 20 s with 1% uranyl acetate. Grids were wicked, air-dried and examined at 25,000× magnification in a JEOL JEM 1200EX-II.
Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions. CHC and CLCA1 were mixed 1:1 at 4.5 µM in storage buffer, the clathrin-assembly domain of AP180 was added at 4.5 µM (GST-C58)50, and the samples were dialyzed against 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 10 mM (NH4)SO4, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM DTT. After dialysis, the sample was centrifuged at 9,000g for 10 min to remove aggregates. Cages were then incubated with 1 mM ATP, auxilin (1.3:1 molar ratio to CHC) and either Hsc70∆C or Hsc70 (at a 10:1 molar ratio to CHC), and aliquots of each sample were applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil R 1.2/R 1.3 300 mesh grids) containing an additional continuous thin layer of carbon, blotted and frozen in liquid ethane. Images were acquired under minimal dose conditions with an FEI Tecnai G2 FEG200 electron microscope at 200 kV with a Gatan sideentry cryo-holder at a nominal magnification of 41000× and underfocus values from 2 to 8 µm with a 16-megapixel FEI Eagle CCD camera with a step size of 15 um; thus, the pixel size of the acquired images was 3.65 Å (representative images of the cages are shown in Supplementary Data Set 3). The contrast transfer function of each image was estimated with CTFFIND3 (ref. 51). Single particles were manually selected and extracted with XMIPP3 (ref. 52). Particles were classified with a free-pattern maximum-likelihood method (Relion 2D-classification)53. To evaluate the structural homogeneity of the different data sets, Relion 3D classifications were performed54, and the D6 particles were selected and used for the 3D reconstruction with projection matching from XMIPP55. A total of 3,468, 5,609 and 4,891 particles were used for the 3D reconstruction of cages, cages + Hsc70∆C and cages + Hsc70, respectively. The resolutions obtained for the 3D reconstruction of the cages, cages + Hsc70∆C and cages + Hsc70 were 28.5 Å, 28.5 Å and 28.7 Å, respectively56. For the subtraction maps, the volumes used were first normalized and filtered to the same resolution (30 Å), then scaled to approximately the same dimensions and finally subtracted with the ‘vop subtract’ option in the Chimera package57. The same procedure was used to subtract the clathrin D6 coat with Hsc70 and auxilin (EMD-5118 (ref. 23)) from the clathrin D6 coat (EMD-5119 (ref. 44)), as shown in Figure 4a,d. Chimera was also used for the visualization of the volumes and docking of the atomic structures.

Data fitting. We followed Rothnie et al.21 and used Dynafit—which fits reaction schemes as sets of simultaneous differential equations—to fit our lightscattering data. In Dynafit scripts, a question mark after a parameter value indicates that the value is to be varied during fitting. The sequential aspect of the scheme used by Rothnie et al.21 to globally fit their data is expressed by having three steps for Hsc70–ATP binding to cages and three steps for the transformation of Hsp70–ATP to Hsp70–ADP, corresponding to sequential loading of an Hsc70 onto each CHC in a triskelion. It also contains five global adjustable parameters (ka and kd, corresponding to the bimolecular association rate for Hsc70 binding to cages and the monomolecular rate of cage disassembly, respectively; kr, corresponding to the rate of ATP hydrolysis; and scattering amplitudes for the starting (CA) and intermediate (CAT) species); and three locally adjustable parameters: an offset (the scattering value of the end state), and the concentrations of the clathrin cages (CA) and Hsc70 (T) for each data set with different Hsc70 concentrations (i.e., a total of 21 adjustable parameters for the example shown with data for six different Hsc70 concentrations: one cage and one Hsc70 concentration is fixed to anchor the fitting). We obtained good fits to our data with this script (Rothnie et al. fit, Supplementary Note 2), but it required cage and Hsc70 concentrations to vary as much as 2× from their experimentally input values and therefore seemed unreasonable. When concentrations were fixed as experimental inputs, the quality of the fits was poor, especially at lower Hsc70 concentrations. We therefore used a script (Simplefit, Supplementary Note 2) corresponding to the simplest scheme that could still capture our reaction profiles and fitted our averaged data individually at each Hsc70 concentration (all reactant concentrations were fixed as experimental inputs). It contains only three adjustable parameters (ka and kd, as defined above, and the amplitude of the scattering of the intermediate (CAT) species), and it was used simply to allow extraction of the global rate (1/(1/ka × [Hsc70] + 1/kd)) of the reaction at different Hsc70 concentrations, because determination of this global rate was robust, but the three adjustable parameters were too tightly coupled (Supplementary Fig. 2) to allow for confident determinations of their values. Global disassembly rates at different Hsc70, Hsc70∆C or Fab concentrations were then fitted with a Hill equation with the cooperativity parameter set to 1.0 to extract the maximal (Vmax) disassembly rate and the Hsc70/Hsc70∆C/Fab concentration at which rates were half-maximal, as described in Results. In cases in which velocities did not plateau at the concentrations tested (for example, with Hsc70∆C and +10-aa or +25-aa cages in Figure 2h,i, we compared velocities at the highest (2 µM) Hsc70∆C concentrations used). With Fab and 0-aa FLAG cages, disassembly appeared to be

incomplete, so fitting was also carried out by fixing final scattering to correspond to complete disassembly (20% of starting intensity), thus resulting in the smaller Vmax and [Fab]1/2Vmax values reported in Figure 2j. With Fab and +10-aa FLAG or +25-aa FLAG cages, the initial binding and subsequent disassembly phases were well separated, thus allowing the separate bimolecular association (ka) and single-exponential-decay (disassembly) rates (ku) to be individually fitted, as presented in Figure 2k,l (again, values were fitted by either allowing the final scattering intensity to vary or fixing it at 20% of the initial value, thus resulting in two values for each parameter).
Statistics. The minimal number of experimental repetitions was set so that the s.d. ranges for experimentally determined values (that were concluded to differ) were nonoverlapping, though in almost all cases the number of repeats (as specified in individual figure legends or Supplementary Table 3) exceeded the minimal number by several fold. A small number (<5%) of data from experimental replicates were excluded when the experimental outcome (for example, value of a rate determination) differed by >2.5 s.d. from the mean of experiments carried out under ostensibly identical conditions and when a reason for the variation (for example, bubbles in the stopped-flow apparatus or the aging of labile reagents) was clear.
