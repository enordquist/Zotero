Summary
Genetic evidence indicates central roles for Hsp70 chaperones in the regulation of heat shock gene expression. This regulatory function has been postulated for Escherichia coli to rely on the direct association of DnaK (Hsp70) with the heat shock transcription factor 19~.This report presents evidence for the physical association of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones with 03* in vivo. Surprisingly, an interaction of DnaJ with ~9 exists that is distinguishable from an interaction of DnaK and GrpE with 03C addition of ATP disrupts the association of DnaK and GrpE with 03*, but not the association of DnaJ with 03*. Furthermore, DnaJ-3 and DnaK-032 associations occur independent of DnaK and DnaJ, respectively. These results suggest distinct regulatory functions of DnaJ and DnaK/GrpE.
Introduction
The heat shock response is an important homeostatic mechanism that enables cells to survive a variety of environmental stresses. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) appearto be constituentsof thecellular machinery of protein-folding, degradation, and repair (Skowyra et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1991; reviewed in Morimoto et al., 1990; Rothman, 1989). The functions of members of the highly conserved Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp60 protein families in assisting protein folding processes led to their designation as molecular chaperones (Ellis, 1987). Given these fundamental biological functions of HSPs, it is not surprising that their cellular concentration is tightly coupled to the environmental and metabolic status of the cell and that altering their levels of expression results in cellular defects (Bukau and Walker, 1989a, 1989b, 1990).
The molecular principles that govern the regulation of expression of heat shock genes are only partially understood. In Escherichia coli, heat shock gene expression requires the heat shock-specific (I subunit of RNA polymerase, 03*, which confers to core RNA polymerase the specificity to transcribe heat shock genes (Grossman et al., 1984; Cowing et al., 1985). Regulation of heat shock gene expression is mediated by controlling the cellular concentration as well as the activity (Straus et al., 1989) of 03*. The cellular concentration of oa2 is controlled by regulation of the transcription and the translation of rpoH (Erickson et al., 1987; Grossman et al., 1987; Nagai et al., 1990; H. Nagai andT. Yura, personal communication), the

gene encoding oa2, and regulation of the stability of 03’ (Grossman et al., 1987; Straus et al., 1987, 1989, 1990; Tilly et al., 1989). In fact, one of the most remarkable features of @ is its extremely short half life (tIf2 = 1 min) at steady-state growth conditions (Grossman et al., 1987; Straus et al., 1987).
Genetic evidence indicates key regulatory functions for the HSPs DnaK (a member of the Hsp70 protein family), DnaJ, and GrpE at the levels of synthesis, activity, and degradation of 032. Mutations in dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE cause partial stabilization of 032(Straus et al., 1990; Tilly et al., 1989); loss of repression of heat shock gene transcription normally found in wild-type cells after temperature downshift (Straus et al., 1989; Tilly et al., 1983); and deficiencies in posttranscriptional regulation of @ synthesis after heat shock (Grossman et al., 1987; Straus et al., 1990). The mechanism by which DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE regulate the activity and stability of oa2is assumed to rely on their concerted activity as chaperones. This activity involves the ATP-dependent binding to substrates of DnaK and the stimulation of hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP by DnaJ and GrpE (Liberek et al., 1991a, 1991 b; Skowyra et al., 1990). It has been proposed that DnaK interacts with @ and dissociates it from RNA polymerase, thereby rendering it accessible to cellular proteases (Georgopoulos et al., 1990). Consistent with this model isthe earlierobservation that preparations of purified E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme exhibit slight cross-reactivities with antisera raised against DnaK (Skelly et al., 1988).
The signal transduction pathway that converts environmental stress to specific alterations in the transcription of heat shock genes remains unclear. There is some evidence to suggest that the intracellular concentration of aberrant proteins is a major determinant of the cellular concentration of HSPs in E. coli as well as in eukaryotic cells (Ananthan et al., 1986; Gaitanaris et al., 1990; Goff and Goldberg, 1985; Kozutsumi et al., 1988; Parsell and Sauer, 1989). An attractive general model is that by sequestering Hsp70 through its binding to aberrant proteins, induction of the heat shock response is triggered (Craig and Gross, 1991; Straus et al., 1990). Sequestering Hsp70 prevents the heat shock transcription factor (e.g., u32)from interacting with Hsp70, which in turn allows activation of heat shock gene transcription (Craig and Gross, 1991). Although genetic evidence supporting this model exists, its key prediction, the existence of physical interactions between Hsp70 proteins and heat shock transcription factors, remains to be demonstrated.
Here we report the association of the DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE proteins with 03’in vivo. Unexpectedly, we observed an association of DnaJ with 03* that can be distinguished from an association of DnaK and GrpE with 032.Our results indicate distinct functions for DnaJ and DnaWGrpE in regulating E. coli heat shock gene expression and indicate that the heat shock regulatory circuits proposed previously should be reevaluated.

Histidine-Tagged 13~Is Functionally Active In Vivo

Short stretches of histidine residues attached to C- or

N-termini of proteins allow the purification of these proteins

from crude lysates by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity

chromatography (Hochuli et al., 1987, 1988). We used this

principle of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography

(IMAC) for the purification of @ and the identification of

proteins associated with c3*. The rpoH gene was cloned

into pUHE21 plasmids such that, upon induction with

isopropyl-8-o-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), they express

recombinant 032proteins with six additional histidine resi-

dues at their C-termini (a3*-C-his) or N-termini (03*-N-his).

These histidine-tagged proteins were evaluated by the fol-

lowing criteria: attachment of histidine tags does not affect

the in vivo activity of 03*; the histidine tags are surface

exposed and accessible for chelation of NiZ+;and chelation

of Ni2+ is not preventing specific protein-protein interac-

tions of 032.

The in vivo activity of the 03*-C-his and 03Z-N-his was

determined by complementation analysis of rpoH765(am)

mutants (882073). These mutants fail to produce func-

tional 03* at 42% and therefore are unable to exhibit a

heat shock response and to grow at elevated temperature

(Yamamori and Yura, 1982). However, when a3%-his or

a32-N-his were provided by the plasmids pUHE21 l-

1(rpoH) and pUHE212-1 (rpoH), respectively, the tempera-

ture sensitivity of rpoH765(am) mutants was abolished. In

pUHE21 I-l(rpoH)andpUHE212-l(rpoH),

theexpression

of rpoH is controlled by a promoter-lac operator system,

whereby the lac repressor is provided by pDMI,l (Lanzer,

1988). In the absence of IPTG, the intracellular concentra-

tion of 03*-C-his or 032-N-his is very low (less than 4-fold the

level of 032in wild-type cells). The finding that under these

conditions full complementation of the growth defects of

rpoH765(am) mutants is observed indicates high func-

tional activity of these proteins. Moreover, expression of

a3’-C-his can induce a mild heat shock response in rpo-

H765(am) cells even in the absence of IPTG and a strong

heat shock response in the presence of low concentrations

(50 PM) of IPTG (Figure 1). In contrast, a heat shock re-

sponse was not observed in rpoH765(am) mutants car-

rying the rpo/%free pUHE21 l-l plasmid (Figure 1). Thus,

it is the activity of &C-his that is responsible for the ob-

served heat shock response. Furthermore, the heat shock responses in a~*-C-his-synthesizing rpoH765(am) mutants were transient and kinetically indistinguishable from heat shock responses in wild-type cells. This indicates that the DnaK-, DnaJ-, and GrpE-mediated modulation of the heat shock response is not affected by histidine tagging of cZ2. Taken together, our results show that 03*-C-his and +Nhis are functionally highly active in vivo as specific transcriptional activators of heat shock genes.
One-Step Purification of Native Histidine-Tagged u32 by IMAC We examined whether the histidine tag of @-C-his is exposed at the surface of the native protein and would thereby allow complexation to Ni*+. Cultures of wild-type cells carrying pDMI,l and pUHE211-l(rpo/-/) were partially induced with IPTG, such that they contain elevated but not maximal levels of 03*-C-his. Soluble extracts of these cells, obtained by mild, detergent-free lysis, were loaded onto a Ni2+column. Proteins that were bound to the column were eluted by competing with the protein ligands, using O-l 50 mM imidazole gradients and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Figure 2A). The great majority of cellular proteins did not bind to the Ni2+column and were recovered in the flow through. A small fraction exhibited weak affinity with the column and was eluted at low concentrations (lo-30 mM) of imidazole (Figure 2A; fractions 5-7). In contrast, two major protein species with apparent molecular masses of 35 kd and 70 kd and five minor protein species, some of which are difficult to detect in the photograph of the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 2A), were efficiently complexed to the Ni2+column and specifically eluted at higher concentrations (up to 150 mM) of imidazole. The major 35 kd protein eluted with a peak at around 110 mM imidazole (Figure 2A; fraction 22). This protein was identified as d3*C-his by immunoblot analysis (Figure 28). Three of the minor protein species (molecular mass of less than 35 kd) also reacted with anti-a3’ serum, indicating that they are proteolytic degradation products of c3’-C-his. An efficient complexation to Ni2+columns was also found for @-N-his (data not shown). We conclude that histidine tags attached either to the N-terminus or the C-terminus of 03* are exposed at the surface of the native proteins and are accessi-

(D), and GrpE (E). The extracts used for Coo-

massie staining (A) and for immunoblots (B-E) were obtained by independent IMAC purifications The slight shift of the peak elution fractions of the proteins seen in the Coomassiestained gel (A) as compared with the proteins seen in the immunoblots (S-E) is due to some degree of experimental variation. The migra-

tion positions of relevant proteins (right), molecular weight standards (left), and imidazole

elution fractions (bottom) are indicated. DnaJ and GrpE are hardly visible in the photograph of the Coomassie-stained gel (A). The 35 kd band that isseen in(E) isdue to cross-reactivity of the GrpE-specific sera with the histidine tail of 03%-his (see Experimental Procedures).

ble to complexation with Ni*+. Thus, IMAC allows the efficient purification of active 03* from crude lysates in a single step.
DnaK, GrpE, and DnaJ Physically Interact with Histidine-Tagged a3* The three proteins that copurified with 03%-his during IMAC are candidates for proteins that are associated with 03*. The major copurifying 70 kd protein eluted between 30-120 mM imidazole with peak fractions at approximately 70 mM imidazole (Figure 2A; fractions 13-14). The molecular weight of this protein and preexisting genetic data (see Introduction) led us to hypothesize that this protein was DnaK. We therefore subjected the imidazole elution fractions to immunoblot analysis with DnaK-specific antisera. Clearly, the 70 kd protein is identical to DnaK (Figure 2C). The two minor copurifying proteins have apparent molecular masses of 40 kd and 20 kd and eluted with peaks at approximately 110 mM imidazole (fraction 22) and 60-70 mM imidazole (fractions 12-13), respectively. We considered that these proteins might be identical to the two other components of the DnaK chaperone machinery, DnaJ and GrpE. lmmunoblot analysis of the imidazole elution fractions with DnaJ- and GrpE-specific antisera revealed that the 40 kd and 20 kd proteins are, in fact, DnaJ and GrpE, respectively (Figures 2D and 2E). We also noticed that the imidazole elution peaks of DnaK and GrpE were shifted by 6-l 0 fractions to lower concentrations relative to the imidazole elution peak of a3*-C-his, whereas the elution peak of DnaJ exactly matched that of 03*-C-his. This will be discussed below. Taken together,

these experiments show that DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE all copurifywith @-C-his. Identical results wereobtained with &N-his (data not shown).
Although the copurification of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE and histidine-tagged 032during IMAC is likely to be due to association of these HSPs with 032, our experiments do not exclude the possibility that DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE are complexed to Ni*+ columns independent of histidinetagged 03*.To test this possibility, we determined the affinities of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE to Ni2+columns in the absence of histidine-tagged crs2.For this purpose, we cloned the rpoH gene into pUHE21-2 plasmids such that they encode untagged cr3’. Wild-type cells carrying pUHE212(rpoH) and pDMI,i plasmids were partially induced with IPTG such that the levels of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE were similar to the levels of these proteins in the 03*-C-hissynthesizing cells used for the experiment described in Figure 2. Soluble cell extracts were subjected to IMAC, and the proteins that were bound to the NV+ column were eluted by a O-150 mM imidazole gradient and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Figures 3A-3D). The majority of the o 32, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE proteins did not bind to the Ni2+ column, and only a minor fraction was eluted at low concentrations of imidazole with peaks at approximately 20 mM (fractions 4-5). These elution peaks were shifted by 17 fractions for 032and DnaJ and 9 fractions for DnaK and GrpE to lower imidazole concentrations as compared with the elution peaks of these proteins in the presence of 03%-his (see Figures 2A-2E). Thus, DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and oa2possess only weak intrinsic affinities to Ni2+columns. We conclude that the specific binding of

A culture of SG13009 cells carrying pDMI,i and pUHEPl-l(rpoH), encoding untagged 03*, was induced for 20 min with IPTG and prepared for IMAC. A Ni2+column was loaded with the cell extract, washed with buffer A, and developed by an imidazole gradient. Aliquots of the cell culture taken before (-) and after (+) IPTG induction, of the flow through (F), and of the indicated imidazole gradient elution fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblots with antisera raised against 03* (A), DnaK (B), DnaJ (C), and GrpE (D).

DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE to Ni2+ columns in the presence of histidine-tagged 03’results from physical interaction of these proteins with tagged 03’.
ATP Disrupts the Binding of DnaK and GrpE to Histidine-Tagged ~9 A plausible reason for the association of 03’with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE is that 03* is a substrate of the DnaK chaperone. A characteristic feature of substrates that are bound to DnaK is their dissociation upon addition of ATP (Liberek et al., 1991 b). We examined whether ATP is also effective in releasing @-C-his from association with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE. A Ni” column was loaded with extractsof IPTG-induced wild-type cells that carry pUHE21 l-l &IO/-/) and pDMI,l. The loaded column was washed first with 30 mM imidazole and then with Tris buffer to elute nonspecifically bound proteins (Figure 4A, lanes l-l 2). The majority of the bound 03’-C-his (Figures 4A and 48) and a major fraction of DnaK ranging from 50% to 80% (Figure 4C) was retained during these washing steps. Subsequently, Tris buffer containing Mg2+ and ATP was added to the column, and this treatment quantitatively eluted DnaK as well as GrpE (Figures 4C and 4D; lanes 13-l 9). In contrast, a3’-C-his remained complexed to the Ni2’column even in presence of ATP and was eluted only with a 30-150 mM imidazole gradient (Figure 4B; lanes 27-34). In control experiments in which ATP was omitted from the elution buffer, DnaK and GrpE remained bound to the column during all wash steps and were eluted together with @-Chis by the final 30-150 mM imidazole gradient (data not shown). Thus, ATP efficiently disrupts the association of

of the GrpE-specific sera with the histidine tail

of 03%-his (see Experimental Procedures).

DnaJ Binds to Histidine-Tagged oa2 Independent of ATP The behavior of DnaJ in the ATP elution experiment, shown in Figure 4, was surprising. In sharp contrast to DnaK and GrpE, DnaJ was not eluted from the Ni2+column upon addition of ATP but instead was eluted together with @-C-his by the subsequent 30-150 mM imidazole gradient (Figure 4D; fractions 27-34). This surprising result indicates that DnaJ itself, in the absence of DnaK and GrpE and independent of ATP, can efficiently and stably bind to 032-C-his.
The existence of complexes between DnaJ and @-Chis was further demonstrated by sizing chromatography of two fractions of an ATP elution experiment that was performed as described in Figure 4. Fraction 32 of the 30150 mM imidazole elution gradient contained 032-C-hisand DnaJ but lacked DnaK and GrpE because of their previous elution by ATP; fraction 38 (not shown in Figure 4) is the last fraction of the 30-l 50 mM imidazole elution gradient and contained 03%-his but no detectable DnaJ, DnaK, or GrpE. The 03%-his contained in fraction 32 eluted from Superdex 75 columns in two peaks, one at 30-40 kd, which corresponds to the expected position of monomeric @-C-

his and another at the exclusion limit of the column (around 80 kd; Figure 5A). The DnaJ contained in fraction 32 eluted in only one peak at the exclusion limit of the Superdex 75 column, together with the high molecular weight fraction of @-C-his (Figure 58). In contrast, the &C-his present in fraction 38 was quantitatively eluted from the Superdex 75 column in only one peak at 30-40 kd (Figure 5C). These results indicate that in the presence of DnaJ, 03*-C-his forms stable complexes having a molecular mass of at least 80 kd, while in the absence of DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE, &%-his is monomeric.
DnaK and DnaJ Bind Independently to 9 The experiments described in the previous sections raise the question whether both DnaJ and DnaK bind directly to cr32.Alternatively, only DnaJ may bind #, and DnaK and GrpE may then associate with preformed DnaJ-032 complexes. Furthermore, it may well be that the binding of any of the three HSPs to 032requires cooperation by the other two HSPs. We first asked whether DnaK alone, in the absence of DnaJ, can bind to r~?~T. o do this, &C-his was produced in dnaJ47(am) mutants (682296) that completely lack DnaJ function, and extracts of these cells were subjected to IMAC. In addition to @-C-his (Figure 6B), a fraction of DnaK was specifically bound to the Ni” column and eluted at 40-70 mM imidazole with the peak at approximately 60 mM (Figure 6B; fractions 14-15). This elution profile of DnaK was qualitatively similar to the elution profile of DnaK in a32-C-his-producing dna6 cells (Figure 6A). Although there were no dramaticdifferences in the relative amounts of c+C-his-associated DnaK observed comparing dnaJ47(am) and dnaJ+ cells, the absolute amounts of DnaK and 03%-his bound to the Ni*+ column were lower for dnaM7(am) mutants. These differences are reflected

in the concentrations of both proteins in extracts of dnaJ47(am) and dna.I+ cells. We were unable to detect GrpE in the imidazole elution fractions, which may be due to a low concentration of GrpE in the extracts of dnaJ47(am) cells.
We then determined whether the formation of DnaJ-a3’ complexes requires DnaK. The most direct experiment to show this is to identify DnaJ-&C-his associations in AdnaK52 mutants that lack DnaK. However, this experiment was unsuccessful because AdnaK5P mutants have very low levels of DnaJ (Sell et al., 1990) and the expression of rY2-C-his proteins causes severe cellular defects in AdnaK52 mutants even in the uninduced state (unpublished data), which is in agreement with earlier reports on AdnaK52 mutants (Bukau and Walker, 1990). As an alternative approach, we examined whether untagged 03* associates with histidine-tagged DnaJ in AdnaK52 mu-

tants. The dnaJ gene was cloned into pUHE212-1 such that this plasmid expresses recombinant DnaJ with six additional histidine residues at the N-terminus (DnaJ-Nhis). DnaJ-N-his is biologically active, as revealed by in vivo complementation of the temperature sensitivity and h resistance of AdnaJ47 mutants. AdnaK52 mutants (BB1553) carrying pUHE212-l(dnaJ) and pDMI,l plasmids were induced with IPTG, and extracts of these cells were subjected to IMAC. lmmunoblots of the imidazole elution fractions revealed that DnaJ-N-his was efficiently bound to the Ni*+column and eluted at 40-l 20 mM imidazole with an elution peak at 70 mM (Figure 7A; fraction 15). A significant fraction of rY2 was specifically bound to the column and exhibited exactly the same imidazole elution characteristics as DnaJ-N-his (Figure 78). We then expressed DnaJ-N-his in dnaK+ cells and analyzed the copurification of 032with DnaJ-N-his (Figures 8A and 88). The elution profiles of the two proteins were quantitatively and qualitatively identical to those found for AdnaK52 mutants, indicating that the association of @ with DnaJ-N-his is as efficient in AdnaK52 mutants as in dnaK+ cells. Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that under our conditions, the formation of DnaJ-N-his&* complexes occurs independently of DnaK, and the formation of DnaK-@-C-his complexesoccurs independently of DnaJ.
Discussion
This report presents evidence for the direct physical association of the HSPs DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE with 03*, the heat shock-specific transcription factor of E. coli. We demonstrate the specific copurification of these HSPs with I+*. The purification strategy relied on the tagging of both 03* and DnaJ with histidines that allowed isolation of 03*-HSP complexes from crude E. coli lysates using IMAC. Since the histidine tagging did not affect the in vivo functions of either protein, this method may prove useful in complementing existing methods for studying protein-protein interactions.
When E. coli lysates containing rY2 tagged with a histidine hexamer were subjected to IMAC, three HSPs, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE, were retained with 03’on a Ni2+column. Moreover, IMAC of lysates containing authentic 032 and

Associationof @ with DnaK,GrpE, and DnaJ 839

histidine-tagged DnaJ revealed the retention of oZ together with DnaJ on a Ni2+column. These findings provide strong evidence for the physical association of 032 with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE in vivo. Together, our results allow us to exclude several potential experimental artifacts. Firstly, the tagging of a3* and DnaJ with histidines did not affect the properties of these proteins in vivo. Furthermore, for histidine-tagged oX purified by Ni2’-affinity chromatography, we have proved that it is active in in vitro transcription (unpublished data); thus, the histidine tag appears to interfere neither with the interaction between the @ subunit and core RNA polymerase nor with the recognition of the heat shock promoter sequence by the tagged o factor. Together, this is strong evidence that the integrity of the structure and function of both proteins is maintained. Secondly, formation of a32-DnaJ complexes occurred regardless of whether the histidine tag is fused to the 032 or the DnaJ moiety. This unequivocally excludes that the interaction of DnaJ with 032 is mediated via the histidine tag of the @ protein.
Thirdly, formation of 03*-DnaK complexes occurred regardless of whether 032was tagged at the N-or C-terminus. This largely excludes two formally possible artifacts. The first artifact is, should DnaK bind to the hexamer histidine moiety itself, it would be expected to affect the high affinity binding of 03* to the Ni2+ chelating column. This is not observed, independently of whether the histidine tags are located at the N- or C-terminus of 03’. The second artifact is, should DnaK bind to conformational distortions of 032 induced by the terminal runs of histidines, one would have to predict a comparable effect of this moiety in both the N-and C-terminal portions of the molecule. This, however, appears highly unlikely. Fourthly, the following lines of evidence exclude the possibility that the o~~-HSP complexes are protein aggregates that result from misfolding of 03* due to its overproduction. First, the cells that were used for our experiments were only partially induced by IPTG (50 PM IPTG for lo-60 min) and therefore contain only intermediate levels of tagged 032. These levels of tagged 03* did not affect continuous growth of the cells (data not shown). Second, DnaJ-03* complexes were present in cells that contained wild-type levels of untagged @ and histidine-tagged DnaJ. Third, under the inducing conditions used, tagged a32 did not self-aggregate but rather existed as a monomeric species as long as DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE were absent (see Figure 5C). Taken together, the demonstration of the physical association of o32with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE is strong support for genetic data indicating roles for these three HSPs in heat shock gene regulation in E. coli (see Introduction). Since Hsp70 proteins also appear to be involved in heat shock gene regulation in eukaryotes (Craig and Jacobsen, 1964), direct interactions between Hsp70 and heat shock transcription factors may play a role in these cells as well.
While the association of a32with DnaK may have been expected from genetic data, that of ap with DnaJ is surprising. It is quite interesting that both associations occur independently and have distinctly different biochemical properties. This conclusion is based on the findings that a3*-DnaJ complexes existed in extracts of AdftaK52 mu-

tants, and 032-DnaK (and possibly GrpE) complexes existed in extracts of dnaJ47(am) mutants; that @-DnaW GrpE complexes were disrupted by ATP, whereas I+*DnaJ complexes persisted in the presence of ATP as well as after ATP elution of DnaK and GrpE; and that c+DnaJ complexes were more stable in the presence of imidazole than the complexes between 032 and DnaK/GrpE. The quantity of c+DnaJ and 032-DnaWGrpE complexes was not dramatically altered in extracts of AdnaK52 mutants or dnaJ47(am) mutants as compared with extracts of wildtype cells. However, our experimental approach has limitations in the detection of less obvious quantitative differences in complex formation, and therefore we cannot rule out a possible cooperativity between DnaK and DnaJ in complex formation. Furthermore, our data provide no information on the relative affinities of DnaJ and DnaK for 03*. For instance, it cannot be excluded that in wild-type cells that contain only lo-30 molecules per cell of 032,the number of 032-DnaK complexes is considerably smaller than the number of aA2-DnaJ complexes, even though DnaK (approximately 5000 molecules per cell) is in a large excess over DnaJ (less than 200 molecules per cell) (Neidhardt and Van Bogelen, 1967). The ATP-dependent release of r~~ from DnaK is a property that is common to all known substrates of Hsp70 chaperones, and thus our data indicate that 032is bound to DnaK as a substrate. The concomitant ATP-mediated release of GrpE suggests that GrpE is associated with DnaK-03* complexes. The known ability of GrpE to interact physically with DnaK (Johnson et al., 1989) and to stimulate its ATPase activity (Liberek et al., 1991a)is likelytoaccountfor itscoelution with DnaK. The lower abundance of GrpE as compared with DnaK in these complexes (as well as in total cell extracts) is consistent with a catalytic role of GrpE. The instability of 03*-DnaK/GrpE complexes in the presence of imidazole is revealed by the shift of the DnaWGrpE elution peaks by approximately eight fractions to lower imidazole concentrations as compared with the elution peaks of o32 and DnaJ. lmidazole groups readily react with electrophilic groups, and this may disrupt ionic protein-protein interactions, especially if acidic proteins such as DnaK and GrpE are involved. In addition, imidazole has hydrophobic properties that may also account for the destabilization of a32-DnaK/GrpE complexes.
While our data clearly demonstrate specific 032-DnaW GrpE and 03*-DnaJ complexes, they do not exclude the existence of additional complexes that involve 032and all three proteins, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE. For instance, the possibility exists that a3*-DnaWGrpE complexes also contain DnaJ which, after ATP elution of DnaK and GrpE, either remains bound to o32or elutes and rebinds to other, monomeric cr3*molecules that are complexed to the column. Moreover, the stoichiometric relationships of the individual components of each complex have yet to be determined.
The demonstration that two HSPs independently bind to C? has major implications concerning the principles that govern the signal transduction pathway of the heat shock regulon. Our data are consistent with two alternative scenarios that may account for the roles of DnaK, DnaJ, and

Cell 840

GrpE in heat shock gene regulation at 30°C. According to one scenario, the first step is the binding of DnaJ to @, which then targets DnaK and GrpE to bind to 032. The subsequent association of all three proteins, DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE, renders 03’biologically inactive and susceptible to degradation. To account for the stoichiometric differences of the DnaK and DnaJ bound to oZ2, it has to be postulated that the 03*-HSP complexes either are very large and contain a large molar excess of DnaK, or DnaJ has a catalytic function and readily dissociates upon binding of DnaK to the 03*-DnaJ complex. In addition to the DnaJ-mediated binding of DnaK to 03*, a DnaJindependent binding of DnaK to c?* exists that might be nonspecific and eventually nonfunctional. A quite similar situation has been described for the binding of DnaJ and DnaK to the nucleoprotein complex that is formed at the origin of replication of bacteriophage h during the initiation of DNA replication (Alfano and McMacken, 1989). According to a second scenario, DnaJ and DnaK compete for binding to cr3’and form independent 03’-DnaJ and 03’DnaK/GrpE complexes. However, the biological consequences of such competition are unclear, especially since genetic data indicate that DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE coordinately affect stability and activity of c? at 30% (Straus et al., 1989, 1990; Tilly et al., 1989). For either proposed scenario, it remains unclear whether it is free a3’or RNA polymerase-bound a3* that is the substrate for binding to DnaJ and DnaK.
The mechanism for the transduction of temperature effects into the signal pathway of the heat shock regulon remains to be determined. It is tempting to speculate that the cellular thermometer that receives intracellular stress signals is not primarily DnaK, but rather the coordinate activity of DnaJ and DnaK. One of several possible signal pathways is that upon stress induction both DnaJ and DnaK get increasingly bound to damaged proteins and thus become less available for binding to 032(Craig and Gross, 1991). This could account for the transient stabilization of 03* during the heat shock response. An alternative signal pathway is that temperature differentially affects the availability of DnaJ and DnaK for binding to 03*. Upon heat shock, DnaK might become bound to damaged proteins and thereby be less available for associating with 03*,while DnaJ might retain its availability for binding to 032.Association of 03* with DnaJ in the absence of DnaK after heat shock, as opposed to the presence of DnaK at 30°C, may in fact increase the stability of 032by preventing its degradation. However, the only evidence suggesting divergent regulatory roles of DnaJ at different temperatures is the puzzling finding that dnaJ missense mutations increase stability of d32at 30°C but not after heat shock (Straus et al., 1990). An additional consequence of this signal pathway is that during stress induction, DnaJ might become unavailable for the more unspecific chaperone functions of DnaK because it is bound to d3*. This transient lack of DnaJ function might temporarily freeze DnaK in a substrate-bound form with an ATPase activity that is lower than in the presence of DnaJ. Retardation of the release of DnaK-bound substrates might be biologically significant, since recent results indicate that chaperone-mediated re-

folding of some denatured proteins not only requires DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE, but also GroEL and GroES (Martin et al., 1991; F.-U. Hart1 and T. Langer, personal communication). These proteins, however, appear limiting in the initial phase of heat stress and must be newly synthesized. In a more general context, DnaJ-directed specific chaperone functions of DnaK, such as the regulation of 032,might be quick, while nonspecific chaperone functions of DnaK might be slow.
Our finding that DnaJ associates with 032increases the number of substrates that are known to bind to DnaJ in the absence of DnaK. DnaJ stably associates with plasmid Pl-encoded RepA (Wickner, 1990) E. coli DnaB helicase (Liberek et al., 1990; Wold et al., 1982; Georgopoulos et al., 1990), and phage X-encoded P protein (Georgopoulos et al., 1990). In these cases, DnaJ appears to target DnaK to bind to the preformed DnaJ-substrate complexes. A reasonable speculation is that DnaJ provides specificity to the DnaK chaperone, which, by itself, has a broad, degenerative substrate specificity. However, in the case of @, it remains to be tested whether DnaJ indeed has such a targeting function for DnaK. In this context it will be interesting to examine the relationship between the members of the eukaryotic DnaJ and Hsp70 protein families
Experimental Procedures
Bacterial Strains and Plasmids Bacterial strains are listed in Table 1. Strain 682064 was constructed by Plvir transduction as follows. We mtroduced into strain GW4701 first a ma/PC+ allele by selection for Mal’ transductants, then a recA allele by selection for a linked Tc’ marker (zfi::TnlO) and screening for ultraviolet sensitivity. Strain 882296 carries an amber stop codon at nucleotide 202 of the coding sequence of dnaJ and therefore lacks DnaJ’ function. This mutant will be described in detail elsewhere. Plasmids pDMI,l (la@, Km’) (Lanzer. 1968) and pUHE21-2 (Ap’) (Bujard et al., 1987) have been described earlier. pUHE21 l-l (for construction of C-terminal histidinefusions)and pUHE212-1 (forconstruction of N-terminal histidine fusions) closely resemble the previously described pDS56 RBSII-6XHis plasmids (Ap’) (Stijber et al., 1990).
Media and Growth Conditions Bacteria were grown aerobically at 30% or at temperatures as indicated in 2 x YTor M9 minimal media (Miller, 1972) supplemented with glucose (0.4%) thiamine (0.001%) and appropriate amino acids (50 ug/ml). Antibiotics were used in the following concentrations: tetracycline (Tc), 10 hglml; kanamycin (Km), 40 hg/ml; ampicillin (Ap). 100 trg/ml.
Genetic Techniques and DNA Manipulations Pl vir transductions and transformations were done using standard techniques (Miller, 1972; Maniatis et al., 1989; Silhavy et al., 1984). Preparations of plasmid DNA and cloning of PCR-amplified fragments were carried out as described (Maniatis et al., 1989). The PCR amplification of the rpoH and dnaJ genes of strain MC4100 was done according to the instructions provided by the supplier of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). As primers, we used oligonucleotides (31-64 mers) that at their S’end were homologous to rpoHor dnaJsequences, and at their 5’ end carried recognition sites for restriction enzymes. Whenever required, appropriate translational signals were included. Plasmids pUHE21 I-l(rpoK)and pUHE21-2(rpoH). encoding o”C-his and untagged @, respectively, were constructed by cloning a PCRgenerated BamHI-EcoRI fragment carrying the rpoH+ gene into the EcoRl and BamHl sites of the vectors. Plasmid pUHE212-l(rpo/f). encoding @-N-his, was constructed by cloning a PCR-generated BamHI-Hindlll fragment carrying the rpoH’ gene into the Hindlll and BamHl sites of the vector. pUHE212-l(dnaS), encoding DnaJ-N-his.

was constructed by cloning a PC&generated BamHI-Hindlll fragment carrying the dnaJ+ gene into the BamHl and Hindlll sites of the vector.
Complementation Assays Complementation tests for temperature-sensitive growth of rpoH765(am) mutants were carried out in 882073 cells transformed with pDMI,l and pUHE21 I-l(rpo/f), pUHE212-l(rpoH), or their parental plasmids. Cell viability at 43OC was determined by plating appropriate dilutions of 30°C-overnight cultures on LB agar plates containing O-500 nM IPTG, or by growing the cells in LB liquid media containing O-500 nfvf IPTG. Complementation of dnaJ47(am) mutants was done in 882296 cells transformed with pDMI,l and pUHE212-l(dnaJ). Cell viability at 43OC was determined as described for rpoH765(am) mutants. The ability to grow I. phages was determined at 30°C by hvir plating assays as described (Silhavy et al., 1984).
Pulse-Labeling Experiments Cell cultures were grown at 3O“C in M9 minimal medium to an OD, of 0.6, induced with IPTG (final concentration 50 PM), and, after addition of IPTG, immediately incubated at 43OC. At the indicated times, aliquots of 1 ml were labeled with 10 j&i of L-j?S]methionine (specific activity >800 Cilmmole, Amersham Corp.) for 2 min, followed by a chase for 5 min with unlabeled methionine (2 mM final concentration). The labeled cells were transferred to ice, washed in minimal medium and lysed by boiling in cracking buffer (see below). Aliquots of 10 nl were subjected to electrophoresis in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were autoradiographed using Fuji RX films.
Purification of Histidine-Tagged Proteins Using MAC Cells producing histidine-tagged oZ and DnaJ were grown at 30°C in 1 liter of 2 x YTlAplKm medium to an OD, of I, At this point, IPTG (50 uM final concentration) was added, and after further growth of the culture for IO-60 min, the cells were collected by centrifugation (6,000 x g, 10 min, 4OC) and resuspended in 20 ml of cold lysis buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCI [pH 71,100 mM KCI, 1 mM EDTA, lysozyme). Thereafter, all manipulations weredoneat 4OC. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridewas added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and soluble cell extracts were obtained by stirring the suspension for 30 min followed by sonification (5 x 10 s, level 7; Branson sonifier) and centrifugation (35,000 x g, 30 min). For IMAC, cell extracts were supplemented with MgCI, (1 mM, final concentration) and KCI (200 mM, final concentration) and loaded onto 4 ml NF+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (prepared according to the manufacturers instructions [Diagen] and equilibrated with buffer A). Chromatography of the extracts was performed at 4OC using an FPLC system from Pharmacia LKB (flow rate of 0.5 mllmin). Loaded columns were first washed with 20 ml of buffer A, then developed by linear O-150 mM imidazole gradients (50 ml, in buffer A), followed by 1 M imidazole step gradients, and fractions of 1.5 ml were collected.
SDS-PAGE and Immunological Techniques Protein samples were mixed with equal volumes of 2 x cracking buffer (40 mM EDTA. 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% j3-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM Tris-HCI [pH 6.81) boiled for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (Laemmli, 1970). lmmunoblots were developed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibodies (Promega), as described by Harlow and Lane (1988). Polyclonal antisera were raised against histidine-tagged DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and a32 that had been purified

under denaturing conditions by IMAC according to Hochuli et al. (1987, 1988). Dilutions for use in immunoblot experiments were as follows: @-C-his antiserum, l:lO,OOO; DnaK-N-his and DnaJ-N-his antisera, 1:7.000; GrpE-N-his antisera, 1:8.000.

Gel Filtration Protein samples were centrifuged (14,000 x g. 5 min). and aliquots of 200 pl were loaded onto a Pharmacia Superdex 75 column (flow rate 0.5 mllmin). As mobile phase, a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7) 200 mM KCI, 100 mM imidazole was used (flow rate 0.5 mllmin). Fractions of 300 pl were collected, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was prepared for SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass standards were apoferritin (440,000) bovine serum albumin (68,000), and carboanhydrase (29,000) (Sigma).
