Abstract
Maintaining a healthy proteome is fundamental for organism survival1,2. Integral to this are Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones that together facilitate the folding, remodeling and maturation of Hsp90’s many “client” proteins3-7. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a model client strictly dependent upon Hsp90/Hsp70 for activity8-13. Chaperoning GR involves a cycle of inactivation by Hsp70, formation of an inactive GR:Hsp90:Hsp70:Hop “loading” complex, conversion to an active GR:Hsp90:p23 “maturation” complex, and subsequent GR release14. Unfortunately, a molecular understanding of this intricate chaperone cycle is lacking for any client. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the GR loading complex, in which Hsp70 loads GR onto Hsp90, revealing the molecular basis of direct Hsp90/Hsp70 coordination. The structure reveals two Hsp70s––one delivering GR and the other scaffolding Hop. Unexpectedly, the Hop cochaperone interacts with all components of the complex including GR, poising Hsp90 for subsequent ATP hydrolysis. GR is partially unfolded and recognized via an extended binding pocket composed of Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hop, revealing the mechanism of GR loading and inactivation. Together with the GR maturation complex (Noddings et al., 2020), we present the first complete molecular mechanism of chaperone-dependent client remodeling, establishing general principles of client recognition, inhibition, transfer and activation.

Main
The highly abundant and conserved Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones are essential for proteome maintenance. Hsp70 recognizes virtually all unfolded/misfolded proteins, and generally functions early in protein folding15. By contrast, Hsp90 typically functions later11, targeting a select set of “clients”7,16. Despite the differences, Hsp90 and Hsp70 share clients that are highly enriched for signaling and regulatory proteins4,16,17, making both chaperones important pharmaceutical targets for cancer18,19 and neurodegenerative diseases20-22. Both chaperones are dynamic molecular machines with complex ATP-dependent conformational cycles that drive client binding/release. Hsp70 uses its N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (Hsp70NBD) to allosterically regulate its C-terminal substrate-binding domain (Hsp70SBD), comprising a β-sandwich core (Hsp70SBD-β) and an α-helical lid (Hsp70SBD-α)15,23-26. In the weak client binding ATP-bound “open” state (Hsp70ATP), both the Hsp70SBD-α and Hsp70SBD-β dock onto the Hsp70NBD27. In the ADP state (Hsp70ADP), the Hsp70NBD and Hsp70SBD subdomains separate, resulting in a high-affinity client-binding state28. Hsp90 constitutively dimerizes through its C-terminal domain (Hsp90CTD) and cycles through open and closed conformations acting as a molecular clamp5,29. In the nucleotide-free state (Hsp90Apo), Hsp90 populates a variety of open conformations29-31, whereas ATP binding (Hsp90ATP) drives clamp closure via secondary dimerization of the N-terminal domains (Hsp90NTD)32. Clamp closure activates Hsp90 for ATP hydrolysis and is a ratelimiting33 process requiring Hsp90NTD rotation, N-terminal helix rotation and ATP-binding pocket lid closure. Unlike Hsp70, Hsp90 can engage clients independent of nucleotide state via the middle domain34,35 (Hsp90MD) and the amphipathic helix-hairpins36 (Hsp90amphi-α) on the Hsp90CTD.
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a steroid hormone-activated transcription factor that constitutively depends on Hsp90 to function10. Building on the pioneering work of Pratt and Toft8,12,13, we previously reconstituted GR’s Hsp90 dependence using an in vitro system14, establishing a 4-step cycle (Fig. 1a) starting with active GR ligand-binding domain (hereafter GR for simplicity). Next, Hsp70 inactivates GR ligand binding, then co-chaperone Hop (Hsp90/Hsp70 organization protein) helps load Hsp70:GR onto

Hsp90 forming the inactive “loading” complex (GR:Hsp90:Hsp70:Hop). Upon Hsp90 closure and ATP hydrolysis, Hsp70 and Hop are released, followed by the incorporation of p23, forming the GR:Hsp90:p23 “maturation” complex. In the maturation complex, GR is reactivated, indicating GR is conformationally remodeled during the transition. A similar pattern of Hsp70/Hsp90 functional antagonism has subsequently been shown for other clients37-40, supporting a general mechanism.
Unfortunately, the molecular basis for almost all of this complex chaperone interplay remains unknown, with high-resolution structural studies hampered by the instability of clients and the highly dynamic nature of client:chaperone associations. Here, we report a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the client-loading complex, providing much needed molecular insights into how Hsp90/Hsp70 coordinate their ATP cycles, how they are organized by Hop, and the molecular mechanisms underlying GR’s functional regulation by Hsp90/Hsp70.
Results
Structure determination and architecture of the client-loading complex
The client-loading complex was prepared by reconstitution using excess ADP to enhance client binding by Hsp70 and an ATP-binding deficient Hsp90 (Hsp90D93N)41 to stall the cycle at this intermediate step, followed by glutaraldehyde stabilization (Extended Data Fig. 1). A ~3.6Å resolution cryo-EM reconstruction was obtained from ~4 million particles using RELION42 (Extended Data Fig. 2-4, Materials and Methods). The resulting structure reveals an architecture drastically different than expected, with the Hsp90 dimer (Hsp90A/B) surrounded by Hop, GR and unexpectedly two Hsp70s (Hsp70“C” for client-loading and Hsp70“S” for scaffolding) (Fig. 1b,c,e,f). Hsp90 adopts a previously unseen “semi-closed” conformation, in which the Hsp90NTDs have rotated into an Hsp90ATP-like orientation but have not yet reached the fully-closed ATP state (Extended Data Fig. 5). The observed Hsp90NTD orientation is stabilized by two

Hsp70NBDs that bind symmetrically to the Hsp90NTD/Hsp90MD interface of each Hsp90 protomer. Hop intimately interacts with each Hsp90 protomer, the two Hsp70s, and remarkably, a portion of GR. Although the two Hsp70SBDs are not visible in the highresolution map, the Hsp70CSBD-β subdomain becomes visible in low-pass filtered maps (Fig. 1b). Also seen in the filtered maps, GR is positioned on one side of the Hsp90 dimer (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 23b,c). Additionally, a lower-resolution map (~7Å) was reconstructed showing a loading complex that has lost Hsp70C but retains Hsp70S, Hop and GR (Extended Data Fig. 6). The observation of the two-Hsp70 and one-Hsp70 loading complexes populated in our sample is consistent with a previous study43.
The nucleotide-regulated interplay between Hsp90 and Hsp70
Two major interfaces are formed in both of the nearly identical Hsp70NBD/Hsp90 protomer interactions (RMSD of 0.96Å, Extended Data Fig. 7a-c). In Interface I, the outer edge of the Hsp90MD β-sheet inserts into the cleft formed by the Hsp70NBD-IA and Hsp70NBD-IIA subdomains (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 8a). Notably, in Hsp70ATP this cleft binds the Hsp70 interdomain linker24,27 and also contributes to binding Hsp40’s Jdomain44 (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Hence, the cleft is only available in Hsp70ADP. Interface I is tightly packed (479Å2 of buried surface area, BSA), and is stabilized by numerous polar interactions (Fig. 2c,d). This explains the reduced Hsp70 interaction and the growth defects and significant loss of GR and v-Src function caused by mutations of the central residue in this interface Hsp90G333 (G313 in yHsp82/G309 in yHsc82) (Fig. 2d) and the 2.5–5 fold reduction in Hsp90/Hsp70 affinity observed for nearby salt bridge mutations45-47 (Fig. 2c).
Interface II (Fig. 2a,b, 280Å2 BSA) is stabilized by both hydrophobic (Hsp90Y61,L64:Hsp70V163,I164) and polar interactions (Hsp90R60,Y61: Hsp70D160). Importantly, it defines the Hsp90ATP-like position/orientation of the Hsp90NTD with respect to the Hsp90MD, explaining the observation that Hsp70 accelerated Hsp90 ATPase activity48. Consistent with the significance of Interface II, mutation of the three

Hsp90 interface residues (Hsp90R60,Y61,L64) showed marked yeast growth defects at 37°C49. Similar to Interface I mutations (yHsc82G309S,E394K), an Hsp90R60 mutation (yHsc82R46G) displayed reduced Hsp70 interaction, inviability at 37°C, and reduced vSrc activity (Extended Data Fig. 9). Lastly, sequence alignments of Hsp90/Hsp70 homologs/paralogues showed that Interface I & II residues are generally conserved, suggesting a universal Hsp70-Hsp90 binding strategy across species47,50 and organelles51,52 (Extended Data Fig. 10,11).
As expected from Hsp90D93N, both Hsp90NTD ATP-binding pockets are empty with their lids open. The Hsp90ANTD and Hsp90BNTDs closely resemble the structure of an apo Hsp90NTD fragment53 (RMSD of 0.43 and 0.35Å to 3T0H, respectively, Extended Data Fig. 12a). The ATP pocket lid and the first α-helix form a novel dimerization interface (426Å2 BSA, Fig. 1d).The two Hsp70NBDs clearly have ADP bound and are similar to the ADP-bound Hsp70NBD crystal structure54 (Cα-RMSD of 0.50Å (Hsp70C) and 0.53Å (Hsp70S) to 3AY9, respectively) (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 13a,b).
Coordination between the Hsp90/Hsp70 ATPase cycles is required for forming the loading complex. The Hsp90ATP conformation is incompatible as closure of the Hsp90ATP ATP pocket lid would clash with the Hsp70NBD (Extended Data Fig. 12b,c). Thus, ATP binding to Hsp90 would be expected to accelerate loss of the bound Hsp70s. Furthermore, the Hsp70ATP conformation is incompatible with the loading complex, as the entire Hsp70SBD would clash with Hsp90NTD/Hsp90MD (Extended Data Fig. 14a,b). For Hsp70 to reenter its ATP cycle, it must first leave Hsp90, thus nucleotide exchange on Hsp70 likely times its dissociation. Notably, in the complex Hsp70NBD-IIA deviates from the crystal structure (Extended Data Fig. 13a,b), likely explaining the weak Hsp70 nucleotide exchange activity provided by Hsp90 during the GR-chaperoning cycle55. The canonical nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) binding sites56 on Hsp70NBD-IIB remain available (Extended Data Fig. 15a,b), explaining how the NEF Bag-1 can accelerate GR maturation55.

Hop interacts extensively with all components in the loading complex
The cochaperone Hop is well conserved in eukaryotes and facilitates GR maturation in vivo57 and in vitro14. Hop is thought to bring Hsp90 and Hsp70 together using its three TPR domains that bind the EEVD C-termini on both Hsp90 and Hsp7058-60. Despite using the full-length Hop construct, only three C-terminal domains (HopTPR2A, HopTPR2B, and HopDP2) are observed (Fig. 1e,f). Importantly, these three domains are necessary and sufficient for full GR activation61,62. Hop wraps around much of the loading complex, with extensive interactions made by HopTPR2A and HopDP2, demonstrating a far more integral role than anticipated (Fig. 3a,c).
The structure of HopTPR2A-HopTRP2B closely matches the yeast crystal structure61 (CαRMSD of 1.47Å to 3UQ3, Extended Data Fig. 16a,c,d), including the conserved electrostatic network (HopY354,R389,E385,K388) that defines the unique inter-domain angle (Extended Data Fig. 17c-e). Focused maps revealed that the HopTPR2A and HopTPR2B are bound to the EEVD termini of Hsp90 and Hsp70, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 18c-e,19a-d). Although the density for the remaining Hsp70 and Hsp90 tails are missing, our structural modeling suggested the connectivity (Extended Data Fig. 20a,b). Unexpectedly, HopTPR2A and Hsp70SNTD-IIA form a novel and extensive interface (578Å2 BSA) composed largely of polar interactions (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 18a-c,f). Notably, Hsp70SNTD-IIA interacts with Hop and Hsp90 simultaneously, thereby rigidly positioning Hop with respect to Hsp90. Although HopTPR2B was in close proximity (~6 Å) to Hsp90MD no major contacts were observed (Fig. 3c). However, the low-resolution Hsp90:Hop cryo-EM structure63 (Extended Data Fig. 21a) and previous studies61,64 show that HopTPR2B can make direct contacts with Hsp90MD. This suggests that Hop may first prepare Hsp90 for Hsp70 and client interaction, and subsequently rearrange upon Hsp70SNBD binding (Extended Data Fig. 21b,c).
HopDP2 makes extensive interactions with both Hsp90 protomers at Hsp90ACTD and Hsp90BMD, thereby defining and maintaining the semi-closed Hsp90 conformation within the loading complex (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, conserved client-binding residues on Hsp90 are repurposed for HopDP2 binding (Fig. 3d). Supporting our observations, Hsp90 mutations which would destabilize the HopDP2-Hsp90A interface (yHsp82W585T,M593T

corresponding to hHsp90W606,M614) cause yeast growth defects65. Our HopDP2 structure agrees well with the yeast NMR structure61 (Cα-RMSD of 1.13Å to 2LLW; Extended Data Fig. 16b), adopting a hand-like α-helical structure, with many of its core hydrophobic sidechains exposed in the “palm” of the “hand” (Fig. 3d). Importantly, this hydrophobic palm is continuous with the client binding surface provided by the lumen between the Hsp90 protomers, augmenting the Hsp90Aamphi-α with a stronger and extensive hydrophobic binding capability.
GR is unfolded, threaded through the Hsp90 lumen and bound by Hsp90, Hop and Hsp70
In the high-resolution map, a strand of density can be seen passing through the Hsp90 lumen (Extended Data Fig. 22b,c). In the low-pass filtered map, this density connects to the globular part of GR on one side of Hsp90 (Extended Data Fig. 23a,b). On the other side, a GR helix is surprisingly cradled in the HopDP2 hydrophobic palm and the rest of the GR becomes a strand embedded in the Hsp70CSBD-β substrate binding pocket(Fig. 4a-d and Extended Fig. 24d,25e). Thus, GR is partially unfolded and threaded through the Hsp90 lumen, reminiscent of how the CDK4 kinase was unfolded66 by the fully closed Ηsp90ATP. To test this unexpected client:cochaperone interaction, we substituted HopQ512 in HopDP2 which is close to, but not directly interacting with, the GR helix with the photo-reactive unnatural amino acid p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (Extended Data Fig. 26b). In support of our structure, GR and Hop become photo-crosslinked (Extended Data Fig. 26a,c). Additionally, mutation of HopL508A (L553 in yeast, Sti1) which is in the hydrophobic palm that directly interacts with GR (Extended Data Fig. 27a), completely abrogated GR function in vivo61.
Despite extensive 3D classifications, the main body of GR remained at low resolution. Nonetheless, the Hsp90MDs from each protomer and the Hsp90Bamphi-α clearly contact GR (Extended Data Fig. 22a,b,c,d). Hsp90 residues previously found34,36,45,46,67 to impact GR maturation are highlighted in Fig. 4e. The exposed Hsp90AW320,F349 directly contacts GR in both the loading complex (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 23c), and the maturation complex (Noddings et al., 2020). Notably, Hsp90W320 (W300 in yHsp82) is an

important binding residue exploited by both clients and cochaperones. Not only does it interact with GR and HopDP2 (Fig. 3d), but also with another cochaperone Aha168. Supporting its broad functional importance, numerous studies have reported effects of Hsp90AW320 mutations on GR activation34,49,69.
Discussion
Our client-loading complex structure provides the first view of how Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hop work together to chaperone a client. Several features were unexpected: 1) two Hsp70s bind the Hsp90 dimer, one delivers client and the second scaffolds Hop. 2) Hop interacts extensively with all components, including GR, going well beyond the anticipated TPR-EEVD interactions. 3) Together Hop:Hsp90 and Hsp70:Hsp90 interactions define the Hsp90 conformation poising it for both client binding, and ultimately for ATP hydrolysis and client activation. 4) Hsp90 repurposes one side of its client-binding sites to bind HopDP2, which in turn augments the Hsp90 lumenal clientbinding site, facilitating client-loading from Hsp70 (Fig. 5a).
The loading complex provides an extraordinarily extended client-binding pocket, with a large and very adaptable surface for client recognition (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 22d): (1) Hsp70 binds a hydrophobic strand, (2) HopDP2 binds a hydrophobic/amphipathic helix, (3) the remaining part of the Hsp90Aamphi-α provides polar interactions, (4) the Hsp90Bamphi-α provides a hydrophobic surface, and (5) the Hsp90A/B lumen provides a combination of hydrophobic and polar interactions. Not only is the loading complex lumen spacious enough to bind a strand (as shown here) or intact helix (Extended Data Fig. 28), but the flexible positioning of the Hsp70CSBD and the dynamic, adaptable conformation of the Hsp90amphi-α allow even broader flexibility for client recognition (Fig. 4b,5a).
Which GR segment is captured in the loading complex lumen? The GR maturation complex structure unambiguously demonstrates that GR’s pre-Helix 1 region (GR517–533, GRpre-Helix 1) is gripped in the closed Hsp90 lumen (Noddings et al., 2020).

Reexamination of previous Hsp70-GR HDX-MS data14 reveals that only GRpre-Helix 1 becomes protected upon Hsp70 binding (Extended Data Fig. 24b) and GRpre-Helix 1 also contains high-scoring predicted Hsp70 binding sites (GR518–524, Extended Data Fig. 24a), strongly supporting that GRpre-Helix 1 is captured by Hsp70 in the loading complex (Extended Data Fig. 24b,c).. Moreover, a previous optical-tweezer study70 demonstrated that GRHelix 1 is readily detached, correlating with ligand binding loss. Together, this implies that perturbing GRHelix 1 by Hsp70 or the loading complex leads to loss of GR ligand binding. Altogether, we propose the following pathway for loading complex formation (Fig. 5b): Hsp70C captures the flexible GRpre-Helix 1, causing the following dynamic helix-strand motif to detach thereby destabilizing the GR ligand-binding pocket. Hsp70C then delivers the partially unfolded GR to Hop:Hsp70S:Hsp90. In the resultant loading complex, GR is further unfolded via engagement of GRHelix 1’s LXXLL motif with HopDP2 and the GRpost-Helix 1 strand with the Hsp90 lumen (Fig. 4b,d and Extended Data Fig. 27), suppressing any possible ligand binding. The rest of GR remains globular and is only loosely associated with the distal surface of Hsp90.
How does the loading complex progress to the maturation complex––a process requiring Hsp90 ATP hydrolysis and release of Hop and both Hsp70s? The one-Hsp70 loading complex suggests that the process is asymmetric and sequential, with the loss of Hsp70C occurring first, while Hsp90 ATP hydrolysis drives the release of the more tightly engaged Hsp70S-Hop. Schematically shown in Fig. 5b, we propose that a combination of Hsp90’s ATP binding and NEF activities promotes Hsp70C to release GR and exit the complex. This leaves GR engaged with HopDP2 and the Hsp90 lumen, minimizing reformation of an Hsp70:GR complex or premature release. Lastly, as discussed in detail in Noddings et al., the conversion of the semi-closed Hsp90 in the loading complex to the fully closed Hsp90ATP in the maturation complex may serve as a driving force for client remodeling and hence activation.
Contrary to kinases utilizing a dedicated cochaperone (Cdc37), GR uses a generalized chaperone (Hsp70) and cochaperone (Hop) for loading Hsp90 clients, making the principles learned here broadly applicable to other clients. Although Hop is absent in bacteria and organellar compartments, Hsp70s are present and the client-binding

provided by HopDP2 is likely substituted by the Hsp90amphi-α. While most, if not all, proteins engage with Hsp70 at least during initial folding, only a subset are Hsp90 clients. Ultimately, client properties must dictate this selectivity. Rather than an overall client property such as stability, our loading complex structure suggests a more nuanced balance of three effects: 1) the probability of partial unfolding fluctuations in the client, 2) the ability of Hsp70 to capture a transiently exposed site, and 3) the likelihood that further unfolding events would uncover adjacent client regions that can be captured by HopDP2/Hsp90. Experiments to test these general principles can now be designed to predict and identify potential Hsp90/Hsp70 clients.
Materials and Methods
Protein purification All recombinant chaperone proteins of Hsp90α, Hop, and Hsp70 (from human), and ydj1 (yeast Hsp40) were in general expressed and purified as described previously14 but with minor modifications as described below. Proteins were expressed in E coli BL21 star (DE3) strain. Cells were grown in TB at 37°C until OD600 reached 0.8. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 16 hours at 16°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000xg for 15 minutes and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 5mM βME). A protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) was then added. Cells were lysed by an Emulsiflex system (Avestin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4°C and the soluble fraction was affinity purified by gravity column with Ni-NTA affinity resin (QIAGEN). The protein was eluted by 50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM KCl, and 5 mM βME. The 6x-His-tag was removed with TEV protease and dialysis into low-salt buffer overnight (50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM KCl, and 5 mM βME). The cleaved protein was purified with MonoQ 10/100 GL (GE Healthcare), an ion-exchange column with 30 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM βME and eluted with a linear gradient of 50-500 mM KCl. Fractions with the target protein were then pooled and concentrated for final purification of size exclusion in 30 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, and 10% Glycerol using a Superdex S200

16/60 (GE Healthcare) or Superdex S75 16/60 (GE Healthcare). The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to ~100-150 μM or greater, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at -80°C. MBP-GRLBD (F602S) was expressed and purified as described previously14. Note that for complex preparation, Hsp70 from Sf9 cell source was used with purification as described previously14. The Hop construct for the crosslinking experiment was obtained using quick-change at Q512 to the Amber codon. The construct was expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells containing the pEVOL-pBpF plasmid71 distributed by the lab of Peter Schultz through Addgene (#31190). Cells were grown in terrific broth to an OD600 of 0.6. For induction, arabinose (0.02%), IPTG (1 mM), and p-benzoylphenylalanine (pBpa; 0.7 mM) was added, and expression was carried out overnight at 16°C. Cell harvesting, lysis, and Ni-NTA purification was performed as described above.

Using reaction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, and 2 mM DTT, 10 μM Hsp90 dimer of D93A mutant, 10 μM Hop, 15 μM Hsp70, 4 μM Hsp40, and 20 μM MBP-GRLBD were incubated with 5mM ATP/MgCl for 1 hour at room temperature. The complex was purified and analyzed by SEC-MALS with a Wyatt 050S5 column on an Ettan LC (GE Healthcare) in a running buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 200 μM ADP and 0.01% Octyl β-D-glucopyranoside (β-OG); Molecular weights were determined by multiangle laser light scattering using an in-line DAWN HELEOS and Optilab rEX differential refractive index detector (Wyatt Technology Corporation). Once eluted, fractions containing the GR-loading complex were immediately crosslinked with 0.02% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature and quenched with 20 mM Tris pH 7.5. Fractions containing the GRloading complex were separately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at -80°C.

To ensure that Hop crosslinks the bound segment in the context of the loading complex, crosslinking reactions were performed immediately after the complex was fractionated from SEC (see the above complex preparation section). Using a UV-transparent, 96well microplate (Corning) as a fraction collector, the whole fractions of the eluted GRloading complex were subjected to UV exposure using an agarose gel imaging system (Enduro GDS Imaging System). Samples were irradiated for 60 mins in total. To prevent overheating, the 96-well plate was placed on a shallow plate filled with constantly refreshed ice water during the time course of the exposure. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze cross-linked product, followed by Western plot transfer to nitrocellulose and probed with an MBP antibody (New England BioLabs) (Extended Data Fig. 26).
Cryo-EM sample/grid preparation and data acquisition
The flash-frozen fractions of the loading complex were thawed and concentrated to 0.70.8 µM. About 2.5 uL of the complex sample was applied onto a glow-discharged, holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3, Cu, 400 mesh), blotted by Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) for 814 seconds at 10°C / 100% humidity, and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. Four data collections were made using Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with K2 camera (Gatan K2). SerialEM72 was used for all the data collections with parameters as described in Extended Data Table 1 .
Image processing
Movies were motion-corrected using MotionCor273, in which the unweighted summed images were used for CTF estimation using CTFFIND474, and the dose-weighted images were used for image analysis with RELION42 throughout. The initial model of the loading complex was obtained from a small data collection (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Particles were picked from the small data collection using Gautomatch (https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/locally-developed-software/zhang-software/) without template and subjected to reference-free 2D classification (Class2d) using RELION. 2D class averages with proteinaceous features were selected for 3D

classification (Class3d) using RELION. For Class3d, the reference model was generated using the semi-open conformation Hsp90 from the Hsp90:Hop cryoEM structure63 (Extended Data Fig. 21). Among eight classes, one class (~8Å resolution) showed recognizable shapes of the protein components, although the class is drastically different from the initial model. This low-resolution reconstruction of the loading complex was then used as an initial reference model for the following image analysis that achieved high-resolution.
The procedure to obtain the high-resolution reconstruction is shown schematically in Extended Data Fig. 2b. Particles were picked from all dose-weighted micrographs using Gautomatch with the low-resolution reconstruction as a template. Without using Class2d, the extracted, binned 4 X 4 particles (4.236 Å pixel-1) were subjected to RELION Class3d (4 classes) to sort out "empty" or non-proteinaceous particles. Particles from the selected class were re-centered and re-extracted to binned 2 x 2 (2.118 Å pixel-1) for another round of Class3d. Note that a low-resolution (~7.5Å) reconstruction of a one-Hsp70 loading complex was obtained among the 4 classes. The selected class that contains 636,056 particles of the two-Hsp70 loading complex was 3D auto-refined (Refine3d) into a single class (consensus class). The set of particles are then used for further global classification and focused classification (described below). For global classification, another round of masked Class3d (4 classes) was performed without alignment, followed by masked Refine3d using unbinned particles (1.059Å pixel-1). Finally, 85,619 particles from the highest resolution, the two-Hsp70 loading class were further subjected to multiple rounds of per-particle CTF/beam-tilt refinement until the gold-standard resolution determined by Refine3d no longer improved. The overall gold-standard resolution for the global reconstruction of the loading complex is 3.57 Å (Extended Data Fig. 3). Local resolution was estimated using the RELION (Extended Data Fig. 3a).
The loading complex presents conformational heterogeneity at all regions of the complex, in particular at the HopTPR2A-TPR2B (Extended Data Fig 17. a-c). Starting from the consensus class containing 636,056 binned 2 X 2 particles (2.118Å pixel-1), masks at various GR-loading complex regions were used for focused classification with signal

subtraction (Focused-class3d; Extended Data Fig. 4b). A pipeline to obtain the best reconstruction for each masked region is outlined in Extended Data Fig. 4a. For each masked region, Class3d without alignment was performed, followed by Refine3d using unbinned particles (1.059Å pixel-1). For each Class3d job, parameters of number of requested classes (K=6,8,10,12,14) and Tau (T=10,20,30,40) were scanned. For each masked region, the reconstruction that results in the highest resolution determined by the gold-standard FSC of the Refine3d job was selected for each masked region. Using the unbinned particles, another round of Focused-class3d was performed with the similar procedure described for the previous round. Parameters were scanned in a similar manner but with smaller requested classes (K=2,3,4,5). Finally, the selected Focused-class3d job was subjected to multiple rounds of per-particle CTF/beam-tilt refinement. The overall resolution of the reconstruction for each masked region is determined by the gold-standard FSC and as denoted in the FSC plots in Extended Data Fig. 4b. The focused maps showed much better atomic details than the global reconstruction at all regions, and hence were used for model building and refinement.
Model Building and refinement
Model building and refinement was carried out using Rosetta throughout. All the components of the loading complex had crystal structures or close homologous structures (from yeast) available. Details of how the starting, unrefined atomic model for each component was obtained are described below. For Hsp90, the starting model was assembled from the crystal structure of human Apo-Hsp90NTD (PDB ID: 3T0H)53 and the cryo-EM structure of the Hsp90MD-CTD from the GR-maturation complex (Noddings et al., 2020). Many crystal structures of Hsp70NBD were available. As Potassium and Magnesium ions were used in the buffer for complex preparation and there is density accounted for them in our focused map (Extended Data Fig. 13), the ADP state Hsp70NBD structure crystal structure (PDB ID: 3AY9)54 that has Potassium and Magnesium ions to coordinate ADP was used as an starting model. For the Hsp70SBD, the human Hsp70 crystal structure (PDB ID: 4PO2)75 was used as a starting model. For Hop, the crystal structures61 of the HopTPR2A-TPR2B (PDB ID: 3UQ3) and the HopDP2 (PDB

ID: 2LLW) from yeast were used as initial templates with the alignments obtained from HHpred server76 (Extended Data Fig. 16). The insertion in the threaded Hop model was completed using RosettaCM guided by the cryo-EM density77. The resulting completed models of HopTPR2A and HopTPR2B showed a high resemblance to their structures determined by NMR individually (Extended Data Fig. 16c,d). The sequence of the Hsp70CSBD-β-bound GR segment was determined with the aid of Rosetta (Extended Data Fig. 25). Two 7-residue GR segments (SIVPATL and IVPATLP) of a continuous sequence (residues 518-525; note that residue 518 in the native GR sequence is T, not S) in the pre-Helix 1 regions are predicted to be Hsp70 binding sites by two state-of-theart algorithms (BiPPred78 and ChaperISM79). Structural modeling of the two GR peptides in the templates80 (PDB IDs: 4EZZ, 4EZT, and 4EZQ) with "reverse" binding mode of Hsp70CSBD-β indicated that the segment, SIVPATL, is energetically more favored (Extended Data Fig. 25a-c).
Using the high-resolution information acquired from focused classification/refinement, the starting models were refined separately into the individual focused maps (Extended Data Fig 4.). Model overfitting was monitored and harbored using the half-map approach as previously described81,82, in which one-half map from RELION Refine3d was used for density-guided refinement while the other half map was used for validation. Rosetta fragment-based iterative refinement protocol82 was used to refine the models throughout. Based on the high-resolution focused maps, the refinement tasks were split into (1) Hsp90A:Hsp70C, (2) Hsp90B:Hsp70S (Extended Data Fig. 4,7), (3) Hsp70S:HopTPR2A (Extended Data Fig 4,18) and (4) Hsp90ABCTD:Hsp70SSBDβ:HopDP2:GRHelix 1 (Extended Data Fig. 4,22). To model the GR segment threaded through the lumen of Hsp90, the GRHelix 1 motif (residues 528-551) was first segmented from the crystal structure of GRLBD (PDB ID: 1M2Z)83 and rigid-body fitted into the lumen density. The GRHelix 1 segment was then rebuilt and refined using Rosetta fragmentbased iterative refinement method into the focused map of the Hsp90ABCTD:Hsp70SSBDβ:HopDP2:GRHelix 1 (Extended Data Fig. 22). The remaining, globular portion of GRLBD was rigid-body fitted initially using Chimera. The placement was further refined, guided by (1) the connectivity to the GRΗelix 1 motif and (2) GR's interaction with Hsp90MD in the maturation complex. The docked GRLBD was then energy minimized in Rosetta guided

by low-pass filtered cryo-EM map. Finally, the connectivities of the N-terminal end of the globular portion of GRLBD and the C-terminal end of the GRHelix 1, and the N-terminal end of the GRΗelix 1 motif and the C-terminal end of the Hsp70-bound GRpre-Helix 1 portion were built using RosettaCM. The final model of the loading complex was assembled and refined into the high-resolution global construction.
Structural modeling was used to ensure and suggest the connectivities of the EEVD tails of Hsp90/Hsp70 to the bound TPR domains of Hop (Extended Data Fig. 20). For each protomer of Hsp90, ~40 residues of the tail were modeled using RosettaCM to connect the bound Hsp90 EEVD fragment and the very C-terminal helix in the Hsp90CTD. Similarly, for Hsp70C, the remaining residues were built, including a Hsp70SBD-α lid closing on the HSp70SBD-β (PDB ID: 4PO2)75 followed by ~30 residues tail residues to the Hsp70 EEVD fragment bound to HopTPR2B.
In vivo yeast Hsp90:Hsp70 interaction assay
Hsc82 plasmids expressing untagged or His-Hsc82 were expressed in yeast strain JJ816 (hsc82::LEU2 hsp82::LEU2/YEp24-HSP82). His-Hsc82 complexes were isolated as described 84. Antibodies against the last 56 amino acids of Ssa1/2 were a gift from Dr. Elizabeth Craig (University of Wisconsin). The Sti1 peptide antisera was raised amino acids 91-108. His-Hsc82 was detected using an anti-Xpress antibody, which recognizes sequences near the 6X-His tag at the amino-terminus. The plasmid pBvsrc, which expresses v-src under the GAL1 promoter, and the corresponding empty vector pB656 were a gift from Frank Boschelli 85. The R46G and K394E mutations were isolated in a genetic screen as described 47.

Fig. 1 | Overview of the GR-loading complex. a, GR activity is regulated by molecular chaperones in a constant cycle. Starting from active GR (left), which is aggregation-prone (lower left) in physiological conditions, Hsp70 protects and inhibits GR (top). Recruited by Hop, Hsp70 loads GR to Hsp90,
forming the loading complex, in which GR remains inactive. Upon ATP hydrolysis on Hsp90, GR is reactivated in the maturation complex of GR:Hsp90:p23 (bottom) and is thereafter released to continue the cycle. b,c, Front (b) and back (c) views of a composite cryo-EM map of the GR:Hsp90:Hsp70:Hop complex. Densities of Hsp70CSBD and the globular C-terminal GR (yellow) are taken from the low-pass-filtered map of the highresolution reconstruction of the full complex. The subunit color code is used throughout. d, Close-up view of the novel dimerization interface of the symmetric Hsp90 dimer. The interface is composed of two molecular switches of Hsp90, the first helix and the lid motif. Dashed line depicts a polar interaction. e,f, Corresponding views of the atomic model of the GR-loading complex. Green circle indicates the C-terminus of Hsp70S.

Fig. 2 | Molecular basis of Hsp90:Hsp70 interactions. a, Hsp90:Hsp70 interactions without the aid of Hop (Hsp90A:Hsp70C). In Interface I (purple rectangle), Hsp90 uses the outer edge of the Hsp90AMD β-sheet to insert into a cleft formed by Hsp70NBD-IA and Hsp70NBD-IIA subdomains. The cleft is where the Hsp70 interdomain linker binds and serves as the allosteric center for Hsp70 NBD to regulate client binding in the Hsp70 SBD. In Interface II (green rectangle), the two ATPase domains Hsp90 and Hsp70 directly interact with each other. b, Close-up view of Interface II. Transparent surface and stick representations are shown for residues involved in the interactions. Dashed lines depict the network of polar interactions involved. c, Interface I is featured with conserved salt bridges (dashed lines). d, Detailed view of Interface II. A β-strand pairing (dashed lines) between the
backbone atoms of Hsp90E332 and Hsp70F217, in which Hsp90G333 is closely packed with Hsp70F217.

Fig. 3 | Hop interacts intimately with all components in the loading complex. a, Hop, shown in ribbon representation, uses its three C-terminal domains (HopTPR2A, HopTPR2B and HopDP2) to interact with Hsp90/Hsp70 beyond the EEVD binding. All the other components are shown in surface representation. The red rectangle highlights that HopDP2 interacts with Hsp90A (dark blue), Hsp90B (light blue), Hsp70CSBD (dark orange) and a portion of GR (yellow). The green rectangle highlights a novel interface formed by HopTPR2A and Hsp70CNBD-IIA. b, Close-up view of the novel Hop:Hsp70 interface with a 180-degree rotation from (a). HopY296 inserts into a cavity on Hsp70 (transparent surface representation), forming a hydrogen bond
with the Hsp70F354 backbone atom. The interface also features many polar interactions depicted with dashed lines. c, A 90-degree rotation from the bottom view in (a) with ribbon model. No major interaction is observed between HopTPR2B and the loading complex. d, Left, HopDP2 uses surfaceexposed hydrophobic residues, shown in sticks, to interact with Hsp90’s client-binding motifs (shown in transparent surface and with hydrophobic
residues in sticks)–– the amphipathic helical hairpin from Hsp90ACTD (dark blue) and Hsp90BW320,F349 (light blue). Right, a ~180-degree view from the left, HopDP2 adopts a hand-like α-helical structure. The core of HopDP2 is loosely packed with many hydrophobic residues exposed in the “palm” (black circle) of the “hand”. Note the GR-binding to HopDP2 is not shown here.

Fig. 4 | Facilitated by Hop, GR is loaded onto Hsp90 by Hsp70. a, Close-up front view of the loading complex (shown in surface representation). GR, shown in the ribbon model, is partially unfolded, with the N-terminal residues simultaneously griped by Hsp70C and HopDP2, and is threaded through the semi-closed lumen of Hsp90. The remaining GR is at the other side of the loading complex; the ribbon model shown for the major body of GR is a modeling result from docking the GR crystal structure to the low-pass-filtered GR density. b, Topto-bottom view of GR recognition via an extended client-binding pocket collectively formed by Hsp70CSBD-β, HopDP2, and Hsp90A/Bamphi-αs in ribbon representation. The N-terminal residues of GR (residues 517–533), which form a strand-helix-strand motif (yellow), are captured in the loading complex. The molecular properties provided by the individual binding pockets are color coded and labelled on the top panel (H and P denote hydrophobic and polar interactions, respectively). c, Side view of the GR N-terminal motif captured by the loading complex. d, HopDP2, shown in surface representation, binds the LXXLL motif of GR Helix1, in which the hydrophobic residues of HopDP2 are colored with purple and those of GR are shown in sticks. e, Residues on Hsp90 (surface representation) previously reported to be important for GR (transparent yellow ribbon) activation are highlighted in red.

Fig. 5 | Schematic model of GR loading onto Hsp90 by Hsp70. a, The molecular principle of GR recognition at the client-loading step. Left, Hsp70SBD (orange) inhibits GR (yellow), providing mostly hydrophobic binding (H). Right, the client-loading complex further stabilizes GR via an extended binding pocket assembled by Hsp70SBD (orange), HopDP2 (pink) and the lumen of Hsp90 dimer (blue), where stronger and more versatile molecular recognitions are provided for both hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) interactions. b, Molecular mechanism of GR transfer from Hsp70 to Hsp90 and the use of ATP hydrolysis on Hsp90. GR in physiological conditions is in an equilibrium of active and inactive states, in which the Helix 1 motif
acts as a lid to stabilize ligand binding when attached. Hsp70C (dark orange) in its ADP state (D) binds GR’s pre-Helix 1 strand, facilitating the following motif to detach and hence inhibit GR (top-middle). Facilitated by HopDP2 recognizing the LXXLL motif on GR Helix 1, Hsp70C loads GR to Hsp90 (blue), forming the client-loading complex (top-right). Although the structure was determined in an Hsp90Apo state, we reason that in
physiological conditions the high abundance of ATP would soon occupy Hsp90’s ATP binding pockets (T). Hsp90’s ATP binding and NEF activity facilitate Hsp70C release (bottom-right). The energy from the ATP hydrolysis (D) on Hsp90B (light blue) is used to release Hsp70S (light orange) and Hop (bottom-middle), followed by full closure of Hsp90.

Plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant Hsc82 were expressed as the sole Hsp90 in JJ816 (hsc82hsp82) cells. Growth was examined by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions of yeast cultures on rich media, followed by incubation for two days at 30°C or 37°C. c, Strains expressing WT or mutant HSC82 were transformed with a multicopy plasmid expressing GAL1-v-src (pBv-src) or the control
plasmid (pB656) (Dey et al. 1996). Yeast cultures were grown overnight at 30° in raffinose-uracil drop-out media until mid-log phase. 20% galactose was added to a final concentration of 2%. After six hours, cultures were serially diluted 10-fold onto uracil drop out plates containing galactose. Plates were growth for 2-3 days at 30°C.

Rosetta full-atom energy generated for each threaded

model. Density plots show the energy distribution (Y-axis=count) of the 100 models, where the top plot shows the

total energy (X-axis) from Hsp70:peptide and the bottom plot shows only energy contributed by the peptide. b, Same

as (a), but using 4ezt as the template. c, Same as (b), but using 4ezq as the template. d, The selected model, which

was the lowest energy model from the job using 4ezq as the template and SIVPATL as the bound peptide. e, Close-

up view of the Hsp70SBD from (d) with surface representation with positive/negative charged residues colored in blue/red (left) and stick representation (right) around the peptide binding pocket. Right, green dashed lines indicate

polar interactions.

Extended Data Fig. 26 | The density HopDP2 binds belongs to GR. a, A time course of UVexposed GR-loading complex analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. Whole fractions of GR-loading complex eluted from the size-exclusion column were exposed to UV using a
gel imager. Arrows at 0 and 60 minutes indicate a reduced intensity of the GR band over the time course. b, Modeling the photoreactive crosslinker p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (pBpa) (magenta) on various positions of HopDP2. The blue arrow on the left panel points at the selected position, Q512 (right panel). c, Western blot of the SDS-PAGE gel after a 60-minute UV exposure, using anti-MBP
antibody to detect the MBP-tagged GR.
