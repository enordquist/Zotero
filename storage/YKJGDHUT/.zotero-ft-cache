ABSTRACT: Many proteins can be partially or completely disordered under physiological conditions. Structural characterization of these disordered states using experimental methods can be challenging, since they are composed of a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of conformations rather than a single dominant conformation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle provide an ideal tool for elucidating the composition and behavior of disordered states at an atomic level of detail. Unfortunately, MD simulations using current physics-based models tend to produce disordered-state ensembles that are structurally too compact relative to experiments. We ﬁnd that the water models typically used in MD simulations signiﬁcantly underestimate London dispersion interactions, and speculate that this may be a possible reason for these erroneous results. To test this hypothesis, we create a new water model, TIP4P-D, that approximately corrects for these deﬁciencies in modeling water dispersion interactions while maintaining compatibility with existing physics-based models. We show that simulations of solvated proteins using this new water model typically result in disordered states that are substantially more expanded and in better agreement with experiment. These results represent a signiﬁcant step toward extending the range of applicability of MD simulations to include the study of (partially or fully) disordered protein states.

■ INTRODUCTION
The ﬁeld of structural biology has for the most part been dominated by the study of the folded states of proteins. Most folded states are characterized by a well-deﬁned threedimensional structure, which can often be determined to atomistic resolution using conventional experimental techniques like X-ray diﬀraction or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Recently, however, it has been recognized that many proteins that perform important biological functions can populate partially or completely disordered states under physiological conditions. These disordered states are typically composed of a heterogeneous ensemble of rapidly interconverting conformations.
It is very challenging to experimentally characterize a conformational ensemble of disordered states with the same level of resolution that can be achieved for the folded states of proteins, since disordered states are not amenable to crystallization, and NMR-derived data may not be suﬃcient to determine the structural properties of such a heterogeneous ensemble with atomistic resolution. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, on the other hand, generate continuous, atomistically detailed trajectories that might be expected to provide a valuable complement to experimental data in characterizing the structural and dynamic properties of disordered states.
Unfortunately, there is evidence suggesting that, at least in some instances, the underlying physical models (“force ﬁelds”) typically used in MD simulations may grossly misrepresent the

conformational ensemble of the disordered states of proteins.1−4 In previous MD simulation studies,5−10 for example, it has been observed that the expanded states of a disordered ensemble are often unstable in simulation and tend to collapse to so-called “molten globule” states. The structures that comprise these molten globule states are as compact as the structures that represent the folded states of comparably sized proteins,11−13 a result which disagrees with experimental observations.14 Such compact molten globule states sometimes display other unusual properties, such as very slow relaxation times and abnormally high degrees of secondary structure content.7,15
Although many of the results obtained from MD simulations of disordered proteins clearly deviate from experiment, the cause and extent of the force ﬁeld deﬁciencies that underlie these disparities remain unclear. If widespread, such deﬁciencies could seriously hamper the systematic use of MD simulation in characterizing the disordered states of proteins. To ameliorate these problems, simulations have sometimes been performed under nonphysical or nonphysiological conditions that tend to counter some of the more evident discrepancies observed in disordered-state simulations; examples include the use of implicit solvent at high temperature13,16,17 and the introduction

of restraints based on experimental data to either drive the conformational sampling18 or select a subset of conformations that are consistent with the experiment.19 These methods, however, may not be suﬃciently accurate for all systems.
In this paper, we begin by systematically assessing the ability of a number of commonly used protein force ﬁelds and water
models to reproduce various structural properties of disordered proteins under physiological conditions. We ﬁnd that all combinations of force ﬁelds and water models tested result in
disordered states that are overly compact, with radii of gyration
(Rg) that are in strong disagreement with experimental observations. We conjecture that an important reason for the
discrepancies between these simulated and experimental results is that current water models severely underestimate water− water and water−solute dispersion interactions.2,20,21 We
evaluate this hypothesis by performing high-level quantum
mechanics (QM) calculations. In agreement with earlier results,22 our calculations indeed indicate that all tested water
models fail to capture the full extent of dispersion stabilization
energy. Remarkably, this discrepancy is largest for those
intermolecular geometries corresponding to the most stable,
hydrogen-bonded conformations.
We then introduce a new, four-point water model, called TIP4P-D, in which the water dispersion coeﬃcient C6 is constrained to be ∼50% larger than in current water models,
and the remaining nonbonded parameters are optimized with respect to experimental liquid water properties. We ﬁnd that,
even while imposing this constraint on the value of the water dispersion coeﬃcient, it is possible to obtain a water model
with good liquid water properties. Simulations performed with
this new water model, featuring increased dispersion, result in
disordered states that are substantially more expanded and
exhibit good quantitative agreement with most of the available
experimental data.
■ METHODS MD Simulations of Disordered States of Proteins. We performed simulations of ﬁve proteins: the apo N-terminal
zinc-binding domain of HIV-1 integrase (IN) (PDB entry 1WJB),23 the immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein L (PDB entry 2PTL),24 the cold-shock protein from Thermotoga maritima (CspTm) (PDB entry 1G6P),25 α-synuclein (PDB entry 1XQ8),26 and prothymosin-α. These proteins were
chosen, as there is a large amount of experimental data
characterizing their unfolded states under physiological
conditions. Simulations were started from an extended
conformation. Initial extended structures of IN, protein L, and CspTm were solvated in cubic 70 × 70 × 70 Å3 boxes, containing ∼10 000 water molecules and 0.1 M NaCl, whereas the larger α-synuclein and prothymosin-α were solvated in an ∼100 × 100 × 100 Å3 box containing ∼40 000 water molecules and 0.1 M NaCl. The CHARMM22 force ﬁeld27 was used to
represent the ions. The systems were initially equilibrated at 300 K and 1 bar for 1 ns using the Desmond software;28
production runs at 300 K were performed in the NPT ensemble29−31 with the Anton specialized hardware32 using a 2.5 fs time step and a 1:2 RESPA scheme.33 Bonds involving
hydrogen atoms were restrained to their equilibrium lengths using the M-SHAKE algorithm.34 Nonbonded interactions were truncated at 12 Å, and the Gaussian split Ewald method35 with a 32 × 32 × 32 mesh (64 × 64 × 64 for α-synuclein and prothymosin-α) was used to account for the long-range part of
the electrostatic interactions.

MD simulations of IN were performed using the Amber12,36 the Amber99SB-ILDN,37,38 the Amber03*,39 the CHARMM22*,40 and the OPLS41,42 force ﬁelds using either the TIP3P,43 the TIP4P-EW,44 the TIP4P/2005,45 or the
TIP4P-D water models. MD simulations of protein L, CspTm, α-synuclein, and prothymosin-α were performed using the CHARMM22*, the Amber99SB-ILDN, and the Amber12 force ﬁelds46 and either the TIP3P, the TIP4P-EW, or the TIP4P-D
water models. In most simulations, relaxation from the initial conditions required several hundred ns to a few μs, and each simulation was run for a minimum of 5 μs. To fully verify the
convergence of Rg, several simulations were extended up to 130 μs. We found that it typically takes a few μs of simulation to establish whether or not a force ﬁeld has a tendency to form
overly collapsed or more expanded disordered states and to
obtain a rough estimate of Rg. On the other hand, substantially longer time scales (from 10 to 100 μs) can be required to
quantitatively estimate other structural properties, like the
secondary structure content or the distance distribution
between two residues (Figure S1, Supporting Information), in agreement with previous ﬁndings.47
A total of 41 simulations, with an aggregate length of ∼830 μs, were performed; a detailed list is reported in Table S1
(Supporting Information). The average Rg was calculated from the squared average of the Rg values of the protein atoms obtained in simulation. Standard errors of the mean were estimated using a blocking procedure.48
Ab Initio Calculation of Dispersion Interactions.

ular interaction energy (EDS) is represented as an inverse power series of the molecule−molecule separation r

where the Cn are positive-valued dispersion coeﬃcients that can be obtained from frequency-dependent molecular polarizabilities using the Casimir−Polder integral.49 Strictly speak-
ing, this approach is accurate only in the asymptotic regime, in which r signiﬁcantly exceeds the molecular sizes. At shorter
separations, one should also consider the anisotropic
contributions to EDS. Finally, when there is non-negligible overlap between molecular electronic densities, this approx-
imation fails unless a damping correction, for which a canonical form has not been ﬁrmly established, is applied to every term in
eq 1.
A more practical approach to obtain EDS is to decompose the total intermolecular interaction energy computed at a suﬃciently high level of quantum theory (i.e., one that includes a reliable representation of dispersion eﬀects) into its principal
components: electrostatics, exchange repulsion, induction, and
dispersion. Following the decomposition scheme presented in ref 50, we deﬁne EDS as the post-Hartree−Fock correlation interaction energy minus the correlation corrections to the
electrostatic and exchange-repulsion components. The correla-
tion energy is estimated at the CCSD(T) level of theory with
the aug-cc-pVTZ(-f) basis set. It is further corrected for the basis-set incompleteness eﬀects, estimated as the diﬀerence
between the aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pVTZ(-f) correlation
energy at the MP2 level of theory. Such an approach was found
to be in very good agreement with earlier results for dispersion energies computed at dimer equilibrium geometries,22 as well as
with the computationally more demanding symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) approach51 (with a typical

Development of the TIP4P-D Water Model. The development of a new four-point water model (TIP4P-D) is presented as a proof of principle to demonstrate the importance of water dispersion interactions in the simulation of the disordered states of proteins. In the parametrization of TIP4PD, the geometry of the TIP4P/2005 water model45 was retained. To capture a larger fraction of EDS, we ﬁrst constrained the dispersion coeﬃcient C6 to a value 50% larger than in the TIP3P water model (for further discussion, see “TIP4P-D, a water model with increased dispersion interactions” in the Results and Discussion section) while retaining the simple form of the widely used 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. Charges and the C12 parameters were then adjusted to ﬁt density and vaporization enthalpy temperature proﬁles.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Assessment of the Ability of Current Force Fields to
Describe the Disordered States of Proteins. To system-
atically assess the ability of simulations to reproduce disordered
states, we performed simulations of the apo form of the Nterminal zinc-binding domain of HIV-1 integrase (IN)23 using a number of common force ﬁelds and solvent models. IN is a
zinc-binding protein that is natively unfolded under standard conditions, as long as zinc is removed from the solution.58 The
Rg of the unfolded state of IN has been determined using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET),59 and the estimated value of 24 Å60 indicates that it should be substantially more expanded than the folded state (which has an Rg value of ∼12 Å when the ﬂexible terminal residues are omitted).
Simulations of IN performed with representatives of the most widely used biomolecular force ﬁelds (OPLS, CHARMM22*, Amber03, and Amber99SB-ILDN) and the

diﬀerent combinations of force ﬁelds and water models all give similar results in terms of the collapse of the protein chain for disordered proteins prompted us to seek common features in these simulations that might explain this ﬁnding. We noted that all water models commonly used in biomolecular simulations span a relatively small area of parameter space and feature very similar values for C6 (Table 1). A possible explanation for this ﬁnding is that, in particular for early water parametrizations, the ﬁt to the experimental data typically targeted by the developers was not strongly inﬂuenced by the water dispersion coeﬃcient.20,62 Parameterizations that resulted in C6 values close to the theoretical estimate based on QM calculations (∼600 kcal mol−1 Å6)63−65 were generally considered acceptable.43,66 No water model currently used for protein simulations deviates much from this value (Table 1). The theoretical estimate, however, only describes the long-range component of EDS. At the typical nearest-neighbor distances (∼3 Å between the oxygen atoms) observed in liquid water, the cumulative eﬀect of the higher-order C8/r8 and C10/r10 terms is no longer a small correction and can even exceed the C6/r6 contribution to EDS.64 This observation led us to suspect that current water models may severely underestimate the full extent of dispersion interactions in the liquid phase.
To verify whether this is indeed the case, we compared the dispersion component of the intermolecular interaction energy obtained at a high level of quantum theory (see the Methods section) to calculations using three popular force ﬁelds: OPLS, Amber, and CHARMM (in conjunction with their typically prescribed water models). Figure 2 shows the results of this comparison for a range of dimers of small molecules representative of the functional groups found in proteins (see more details in Table S3, Supporting Information). Despite having long tails, all the three error distributions corresponding to the interactions not involving water feature a relatively small systematic bias, indicating that, on average, these interactions are reasonably balanced. On the other hand, interactions that involve water are systematically underestimated by the three force ﬁelds, with the largest discrepancies observed for the water−water dimers. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) provides a more detailed picture by comparing, across a range of intermolecular separations, the water dimer results with the results for two nonpolar examples: butane and benzene dimers; the error is largest at the water−water equilibrium distance, where the interaction is underestimated by roughly a factor of 2.
This observation that water dispersion interactions are severely underestimated is applicable beyond the three water models considered here, as nearly all popular water models feature very similar C6 coeﬃcients (Table 1). This ﬁnding calls into question whether current water models correctly describe the relative balance between the highly directional hydrogenbonding interactions and the nearly isotropic dispersion interactions. Obtaining the correct balance between these interactions is expected to be an important factor in accurately describing the solvation of proteins and may have important consequences for the ability of simulations to correctly describe the highly hydrated disordered states.
TIP4P-D, a Water Model with Increased Dispersion
Interactions. To demonstrate the importance of achieving a better balance between water dispersion and electrostatic interactions for biomolecular simulations, we parametrized a new water model (TIP4P-D) that features a signiﬁcantly higher dispersion coeﬃcient: C6 = 900 kcal mol−1 Å6 (i.e., ∼50% larger

Figure 2. Dispersion energy comparison between high-level quantum calculations and three popular force ﬁelds: OPLS/SPCE (lower panel), Amber/TIP3P (middle panel), and CHARMM/TIP3PCHARMM (upper panel). The comparison was performed for a diverse set of dimers of small molecules representative of the functional groups found in proteins. Shown are Gaussian approximations to the actual error distributions. The data set is split into three categories: water dimer (green vertical lines), water interacting with other molecules (red curves), and interactions not involving water (black curves). Dashed lines correspond to the TIP4P-D water model. The vertical axis is in arbitrary units. All distributions are normalized to the same value at the maximum.
than in most popular models; see Table 1). It is important to stress that the C6/r6 functional form is intrinsically incapable of accurately reproducing EDS at all dimer separations (Figure S2, Supporting Information). On the other hand, using a more realistic functional form (e.g., explicitly considering the additional C8/r8 and C10/r10 terms) would not allow us to preserve compatibility with standard biomolecular force ﬁelds, which describe dispersion interactions using only the C6/r6 term. Our choice of the C6 value is thus an attempt to strike a balance between compensating for the missing higher-order (r−8, r−10, etc.) terms and keeping the asymptotic error reasonably small. This results in short-range dispersion interaction energies similar to those of the highly accurate, polarizable iAMOEBA water model,67 which features a more ﬂexible functional form68 for the dispersion interaction.
Imposing an additional constraint on the C6 coeﬃcient naturally limits the model’s ability to reproduce experimental liquid water properties; nevertheless, as can be seen in Table 1, this unusually high C6 value did not prevent TIP4P-D from reproducing most of the key liquid water properties (including the diﬀusion and surface tension, which were not in our training set) at a level of accuracy similar to other four-point water models. It is interesting to note that, along with enhanced dispersion, TIP4P-D features slightly stronger electrostatic interactions, as represented by the dipole moment, which is

0.05−0.1 D larger than that of any other model in Table 1, and is in slightly better agreement with ab initio simulations.69,70 A larger dipole moment is necessary to reproduce with reasonable accuracy the temperature of maximum density and the thermal expansion coeﬃcient but leads to an overestimation of the vaporization enthalpy.
It has been shown that the hydration free energies of small molecules can be strongly inﬂuenced by changes in the watersolute dispersion coeﬃcient.21 Using the TIP4P-D water model, we calculated the hydration free energies ΔGh for small molecules representing the side-chain groups of natural amino acids and compared them with the ΔGh values obtained using standard water models (Figure 3). The comparison shows

Hydration free energy (ΔGh) of small molecular fragments in the TIP3P (black circles), TIP4P/2005 (red circles), and TIP4P-D (blue circles) water models compared to the values determined experimentally. Each fragment is a model for an amino acid side chain; the name of the corresponding amino acid is reported near each data point. N-Methylacetamide (NMA) is the small molecule used as a model for the protein backbone. The Amber99SB force ﬁeld was used to describe the molecular fragments. A very similar plot is obtained for the CHARMM22 force ﬁeld (see Figure S4, Supporting Information).
that the modiﬁed water model improves agreement with experimental values of ΔGh, though only marginally. This suggests that, in this case, the diﬀerence in dispersion coeﬃcient does not strongly inﬂuence the hydration properties of small molecules.
Determining the Eﬀect of Increasing Water Dispersion on Simulations of Disordered Protein Ensembles. While it has been proposed2 that many liquid water properties are relatively insensitive to the exact value of the dispersion coeﬃcient, a proposition that largely agrees with our ﬁndings, some eﬀect is observed on surface tension, which appears to grow as the water dispersion coeﬃcient (C6) increases71 (Table 1). This observation suggests that the hydration and structural properties of large solutes may be aﬀected, as they are also inﬂuenced by water surface tension.72 To examine how a change in dispersion inﬂuences the results of protein simulations, we compare protein simulations performed using the TIP4P-D model with simulations performed using

conventional water models, with a particular emphasis on the properties of disordered states.
We ﬁnd that, for all ﬁve disordered proteins considered (IN, CspTm, protein L, α-synuclein, and prothymosin-α), Amber and CHARMM simulations performed with TIP4P-D result in disordered states that are substantially more expanded and that are generally in much better agreement with the experimental estimates than those obtained with any combination of the original force ﬁelds (Figure 1A−E). It is notable that this eﬀect is observed despite the fact that the solubility of the individual protein fragments in isolation, as inferred by hydration free energy calculations performed on small-molecule analogues, is not strongly inﬂuenced by the choice of water model (Figure 3).
Although the eﬀect of TIP4P-D water on the size of disordered states is fairly general, not all force ﬁelds behave in exactly the same way. OPLS simulations with TIP4P-D result in only marginal improvements in Rg (Figure 1A), suggesting that this force ﬁeld may require even larger values of the water dispersion coeﬃcient to transition to more expanded states. On the other hand, simulations of the highly charged prothymosinα performed with CHARMM22* and the TIP3P water model result in reasonably expanded disordered states, suggesting that this force ﬁeld may be suitable for simulations of highly charged disordered systems even in conjunction with standard water models. In this respect, it is interesting to note that, among the three force ﬁelds shown in Figure 2, CHARMM has the smallest systematic error for the interactions involving water.
These results strongly suggest that the dispersion interactions are an important component for determining the hydration properties of large macromolecules, and in particular for ﬁnetuning the balance between disordered, expanded states and compact, collapsed states.
Detailed Comparison of the α-Synuclein Simulations to Experimental Data. A large amount of experimental data is available for α-synuclein, allowing a robust assessment of the quality of the structural ensembles observed in simulations. Here we compare the Amber12 results obtained in TIP3P and TIP4P-D simulations with NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and FRET data that probe both the local and nonlocal structural and dynamic properties of the ensemble (Figures 4 and 5). The simulation run using the TIP4P-D water model is in substantially better agreement with experimental measurements for nearly all of the data presented here than the simulation run with TIP3P.
The average Rg observed in the simulation using TIP4P-D (29 Å) is much larger than that observed in TIP3P (15 Å) and is in much closer agreement with the 27−35 Å experimental estimates obtained from NMR73 and SAXS74 measurements. Accordingly, the average SAXS proﬁle, calculated with the program FoXS,75,76 from the TIP4P-D simulation is in much better agreement with the experimental proﬁle74 than the proﬁle obtained from the TIP3P simulation (Figure 4A).
NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements provide detailed information about the relative populations of long-range contacts. We have compared the simulation results with a large set of previously measured intramolecular PRE data obtained from 12 paramagnetic labels containing information on 1226 interatomic distances.77−81 Two representative PRE intensity-ratio proﬁles are displayed in Figure 4B, and the full comparison to all 12 spin-label proﬁles is reported in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). The TIP3P simulation contains too many persistent long-range contacts

Figure 5. Inter-residue distances in α-synuclein. Comparison of simulated and experimental61,86,87 mean distances between residues in α-synuclein. Distances in simulation were calculated as the average Cα−Cα distance over 20 μs of simulation performed in TIP4P-D water with the Amber12 force ﬁeld (black), the Amber99SB-ILDN force ﬁeld (red), or the CHARMM22* force ﬁeld (blue). The ﬁrst 0.5 μs of
simulation were not considered in the analysis.

compared to the experimental PREs because the sampled structures are too compact. Both in the experiments and in the TIP4P-D simulation, the population of intramolecular contacts deviates from the behavior expected from a random coil, though contacts that are distant in sequence are often populated to a lesser extent in the simulation than in experiment. These results suggest that the sampling of extended structures in TIP4P-D simulations is not achieved at the cost of a complete elimination of experimentally observed long-range contacts.
NMR chemical shifts and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are sensitive probes of the local conformational preferences of intrinsically disordered proteins.82−84 We observe signiﬁcant improvements for chemical shifts and RDCs back-calculated from the structures sampled in the TIP4P-D simulation compared to the TIP3P ensemble. The deviation between the calculated 1DNH RDCs and the experimental values, quantiﬁed by the Q-factor, is 0.51 for the TIP4P-D simulation and 1.26 for TIP3P (Figure 4C). The average root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) between calculated and experimental chemical shifts in the TIP4P-D simulation are 0.63, 0.19, 1.95, 0.34, and 0.92 ppm (ppm) for Cα, HN, N, C′, and Cβ shifts, respectively; these deviations are substantially smaller than the values of 1.18, 0.38, 3.26, 0.67, and 1.22 ppm that were obtained for the TIP3P simulation.
Importantly, the chemical shift prediction errors obtained for the TIP4P-D ensemble are lower than the average prediction errors obtained from a benchmark database of static X-ray

structures of globular proteins,84 and the prediction errors of
the TIP4P-D ensemble are similar in accuracy to the errors
obtained by sequence-based predictions of random-coil chemical shifts.85 Taken together, the agreement between
calculated and experimental chemical shifts and RDCs suggests
that the TIP4P-D simulation provides a reasonably accurate description of the local conformational properties of α-
synuclein. NMR 15N R2 transverse relaxation rates reﬂect the frequency
distributions of the motions of amide bond vectors in proteins.
R2 values calculated from MD simulations have previously been demonstrated to be strongly aﬀected by the structural features of intrinsically disordered protein ensembles, the time scales of
intramolecular motions, and the time scales of overall rotational tumbling.47,83 We compared R2 relaxation rates calculated from simulation runs using TIP4P-D and TIP3P to the experimental values80 (Figure 4D). The R2 rates back-calculated from the simulation run with TIP3P have a somewhat lower RMSD from
the experimental values (1.16 Hz) than does the simulation run
using TIP4P-D (1.42 Hz). They show, however, smaller sequence variations and have a lower correlation coeﬃcient
with the experimental values (r = 0.24) compared to the
simulation run using TIP4P-D (r = 0.40). These results suggest that, for the molten globule-like
structures observed in the TIP3P simulation, relaxation is
largely determined by the overall rotational tumbling, which aﬀects all residues similarly, and that R2 rates do not contain useful information on local ﬂexibility. On the contrary, the ﬂuctuations of the R2 rates calculated from TIP4P-D simulations, although globally shifted toward values that are
slightly too high, correctly identify the regions of higher R2 rates centered near residues 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120, which suggests that the ﬂuctuations provide a meaningful measure of local ﬂexibility. We note that, if the time axis of the amide bond
vector autocorrelation functions used to calculate the R2 rates is scaled to correct for the slightly excessive viscosity of the
TIP4P-D water model relative to experiment, the agreement
with experimental R2 rates improves (RMSD = 1.14 Hz) but remains globally shifted to values that are too high. (The average simulated R2 is 4.76 Hz, compared to the experimental average of 3.86 Hz.) This suggests that the description of the rotational and segmental diﬀusion of proteins in TIP4P-D
water could be further improved.
Finally, a number of intraresidue distances have been measured experimentally for this protein using ﬂuorescence spectroscopy techniques.61,86,87 Although long-range distances
calculated from TIP3P simulations are invariably much shorter
than the experimental estimates, the Amber12 and Amber99SB
simulations performed with TIP4P-D water reproduce the
experimental results quite well (Figure 5). Simulations performed with the CHARMM22* force ﬁeld in TIP4P-D
water are in somewhat worse agreement with the experimental
data (Figure 5), with some long-range contacts having a high
probability to form. Analysis of the trajectory suggests that the
underlying reason is the repeated formation of knotted structures that persist on the 1−10 μs time scale during the simulation. This results in a structural ensemble with persistent long-range contacts that is very diﬀerent from the ensembles of
the Amber simulations, where no knotting occurs. Simulation of Folded Proteins Using the TIP4P-D
Water Model. The dramatic eﬀect of the TIP4P-D water
model on simulations of the disordered states of proteins raises the legitimate concern that it could excessively destabilize

simulations of the ordered, folded states.21 To address this question, we performed 10 μs simulations of the native states of ubiquitin and GB3 in TIP4P-D water. Both proteins were stable on the 10 μs time scale, but the simulations resulted in structural ensembles that were more dynamic than those obtained with standard water models and were in somewhat worse agreement with NMR data (Table S2, Supporting Information), suggesting that the TIP4P-D water model may slightly destabilize the folded states of proteins. We quantiﬁed the amount of destabilization by performing reversible-folding simulations of a WW domain (using Amber99SB-ILDN) and of the villin headpiece (using Amber12) in TIP4P-D water. These simulations indicate that, at around the melting temperature, the native states of these two proteins are destabilized by ∼2 kcal mol−1 in TIP4P-D compared to TIP3P.
We speculate that, using standard water models, the strong tendency to produce collapsed structures may lead to an overstabilization of the compact folded state that could mask other force ﬁeld deﬁciencies. Because the TIP4P-D water model strongly reduces the propensity for collapse, the eﬀects of other force ﬁeld inaccuracies are more evident. Exposing these eﬀectively “hidden” force ﬁeld problems should allow researchers to address them more directly, which may ultimately lead to more accurate models and improved simulations of folded proteins.
■ CONCLUSION
Simulations based on current physics-based water models and protein force ﬁelds systematically fail to describe key structural properties of disordered statesa ﬁnding we attribute to a failure of commonly used water models to account for the full extent of dispersion interactions. We have created a new water model, TIP4P-D, that retains the standard 12-6 LJ potential (thus preserving compatibility with most existing biomolecular force ﬁelds) while increasing the strength of dispersion interaction. Simulations performed with TIP4P-D result in a
slight destabilization of native states, but the model greatly improves the description of disordered protein states, allowing meaningful comparisons to be made between the results of unrestrained atomistic simulations and experimental studies of such states. These results are very encouraging, as we (i) did not exhaustively search for an optimal value for the water dispersion coeﬃcient and (ii) did not modify parameters of the protein force ﬁelds. We expect that the agreement between experiments and simulations for various protein states could be further improved by using more realistic functional forms. This would, however, require redesigning and reparameterizing not only the water model but also the protein force ﬁeld.

(46) Amber12 and Amber99SB-ILDN are very similar force ﬁelds, but Amber12 tends to yield unfolded states characterized by more helical content than Amber99SB-ILDN. A comparison between the two force ﬁelds thus allows one to evaluate the eﬀect of a force ﬁeld’s propensity for the formation of a particular type of secondary structure. We chose to focus further on the Amber suite of force ﬁelds because, in principle, they have not been parametrized to be used with a particular water model; they are thus expected to be slightly more transferable across diﬀerent water models.

and because we generally observe large qualitative discrepancies
between experimental estimates and computational results. Also, a
rough initial estimate of Rg can be obtained from simulations only a few microseconds long (Figure S1, Supporting Information), whereas
converging other structural properties often requires much longer time
scales. (60) Müller-Spaẗ h, S.; Soranno, A.; Hirschfeld, V.; Hofmann, H.; Rüegger, S.; Reymond, L.; Nettels, D.; Schuler, B.

Unfortunately, this computationally convenient functional form provides overly strong repulsion.89−91 In order to obtain a reasonable description of the ﬁrst peak of the RDF using this steep repulsive functional form, a weak attractive dispersion coeﬃcient must be used.

■ NOTE ADDED IN PROOF
After submission of this work, Best and coworkers95 have shown that, as suggested by previous work,21 optimization of the solute−solvent dispersion interaction against experimental
data can also result in more expanded disordered protein
ensembles that agree well with experiment. The expansion seems to be driven by the increase in solute−solvent interactions, as reﬂected by the diﬀerences in the hydration
free energies of small molecules. There are clearly similarities
with the present study, as increasing the water dispersion coeﬃcient also results in increased solute−solvent dispersion
interactions. However, in this case, additional changes are also introduced that have the net eﬀect of leaving the hydration free
energy of small molecules almost unchanged. This observation
raises the intriguing question of whether these studies, while sharing several similarities, may be describing a diﬀerent
underlying physics.
