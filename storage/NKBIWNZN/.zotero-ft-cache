Abstract

The chaperonin GroEL binds a variety of polypeptides that share no obvious sequence similarity. The precise structural, chemical and dynamic features that are recognised remain largely unknown. Structural models of the complex between GroEL and its co-chaperonin GroES , and of the isolated apical domain of GroEL (minichaperone; residues 191-376) with a 17 residue N-terminal tag show that a linear sequential sequence (extended β-strand) can be bound. We have analysed characteristics of the motifs that bind to GroEL by using affinity panning of immobilised GroEL minichaperones for a library of bacteriophages that display the fungal cellulose-binding domain of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase I. This protein has seven non-sequential residues in its binding site that form a linear binding motif with similar dimensions and characteristics to the peptide tag that was bound to the minichaperone GroEL(191-376). The seven residues thus form a constrained scaffold. We find that GroEL does bind suitable mutants of these seven residues. The side-chains recognised do not have to be totally hydrophobic, but polar and positively charged chains can be accommodated. Further, the spatial distribution of the side-chains is also compatible with those in an α-helix. This implies that GroEL can bind a wide range of structures, from extended β-strands and α-helices to folded states, with exposed side-chains. The binding site can accommodate substrates of approximately 18 residues when in a helical or seven when in an extended conformation. The data support two activities of GroEL: the ability to act as a temporary parking spot for sticky intermediates by binding many motifs; and an unfolding activity of GroEL by binding an extended sequential conformation of the substrate.
Introduction

The GroE chaperonin of Escherichia coli is essential for the folding and assembly of some newly synthesised polypeptides and for the recovery of stress-denatured proteins (Goloubinoff et al ., 1989). This complex molecular machine consists of 14 identical 57.5 kDa subunits of GroEL, which form a cylinder containing a central cavity ∼45 Å wide Braig et al 1994, Saibil et al 1993, and seven or 14 10 kDa GroES subunits, and is fuelled by ATP hydrolysis. Each 57.5 kDa subunit consists of three domains. The ATP-binding equatorial domain (residues 6-133 and 409-523) connects the two heptameric rings stacked back-to-back that form the cylinder. The apical domain (residues 191-376) forms the flexible opening of the cylinder and contains the polypeptide-binding and GroES-binding sites, which line the inner wall of the cavity. The intermediate domain (residues 134-190 and 377-408) makes intersubunit contacts within a ring and transmits ATP and GroES-mediated allosteric effects.

The mechanism of the GroE chaperonin is still under debate Fenton and Horwich 1997, Hartl 1996, Lorimer 1996. Certainly, there is a spectrum of mechanisms for GroE-mediated protein folding, depending on the nature of the substrate (Peres Ben-Zvi et al ., 1998). The basic function of GroEL in facilitating folding is to provide a hydrophobic binding site Buckle et al 1997, Fenton et al 1994, Zahn et al 1996a, which prevents aggregation of folding intermediates and can lead to the unfolding of compact states (Zahn et al ., 1996b). At one extreme, proteins can fold in a “cage” of GroEL subunits.

The recently determined crystal structure of the GroEL.GroES.(ADP) 7 complex at 3 Å resolution shows that GroES caps the end of the GroEL ring and each of its seven subunits binds the apical, polypeptide-binding domains of GroEL via the extended segment of its modile loop (Figure 1(a)). ATP-driven movements of apical and intermediate domains of GroEL allow GroES to bind to and change the character of the polypeptide binding site from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic, facilitating the release of bound polypeptide (Xu et al ., 1997). The bacteriophage T4 co-chaperonin Gp31 has a similar binding mode to that of GroES (Hunt et al ., 1997). But, crystallographic studies on intact GroEL have not resolved the structures of any bound peptide substrate. The structural nature of binding of non-native proteins by GroEL is unresolved (for a review, see Horovitz, 1998).

Functionally active monomeric minichaperones Chatellier et al 1998, Zahn et al 1996a, which contain only a part of the polypeptide binding domain of GroEL (Fenton et al ., 1994), are more amenable to detailed peptide recognition studies than is the intact tetradecamer. The crystal structure at 1.7 Å resolution of GroEL(191-376) with a 17 residue N-terminal tag reveals the interaction of the N-terminal tag of one molecule with the active site of a neighbouring molecule (Figure 1(b)). This shows the detail of an individual binding site and suggests a model for the binding of long peptides around the rim of seven subunits in the cavity of the tetradecamer (Buckle et al ., 1997). GroEL minichaperones, therefore, constitute a paradigm for understanding GroEL-substrate interactions at the atomic level.

Further experiments are required to answer the questions: What structural and chemical features of polypeptide substrates are recognised by GroEL? What conformations do substrates adopt whilst bound to GroEL? And how does GroEL discriminate between native proteins and its misfolded protein substrates? Random mutagenesis of simple peptides followed by selection by binding to immobilised GroEL (affinity panning) can be used to determine the nature of the side-chains that bind. But this procedure has the disadvantage that the three-dimensional structure of such peptides is not generally constrained. To overcome this problem, we have used affinity panning of GroEL minichaperones for a library of bacteriophages that display constrained peptides. As a peptide model, we chose the C-terminal cellulose-binding domain (CBD) of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase I from the fungus Trichoderma reesei (Figure 1(c); Kraulis et al ., 1989). This domain belongs to the knottin family, proteins that bind with a high degree of specificity to their target (Le Nguyen et al ., 1990). Knottins share a common scaffold comprising a small triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and disulphide bond framework (Figure 1(c)). Cellulose binding is mediated by a 400 Å 2 patch of seven functional residues (Linder et al ., 1995) that form a hydrophilic, flat face of the domain (Figure 1(c)). In the primary sequence, these residues are located in two separate regions: one close to the N terminus (residues 4, 5 and 7) and the other near the C terminus (residues 29, 31, 32 and 34). In the library, the seven functional residues were randomised (Smith et al ., 1998). The side-chains of those seven residues have a similar stereochemistry to those in the proposed model for a substrate bound to GroEL (Buckle et al ., 1997). The cellulose-binding domain thus offers a stable scaffold from which to identify the nature, size and shape of surface sites that bind GroEL. We interpret our findings in the light of the structural models of the GroEL-GroES and minichaperone GroEL(191-376)-peptide tag complexes.

Selection of cellulose-binding domain (CBD) proteins

Techniques for defining substrate specificity of GroEL are readily suggested by analogy of GroEL minichaperones with monomeric Hsp70 family members, although the folding activity of the latter is ATP-dependent (Bukau & Horwich, 1998). The substrate-specificity of chaperones has been defined using the panning of large libraries of phage-displayed peptides (Smith, 1985) against the immobilised, purified chaperones Blond-Elguindi et al 1993, Gragerov et al 1994, Hightower et al 1994.

Discussion

To characterise the nature, size and shape of surface sites that bind GroEL, we used affinity panning of immobilised functional minichaperone sht-GroEL(191-345) for a large library of bacteriophages that display the fungal cellulose-binding domain of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase I randomly mutated at seven discontinuous positions on the domain hydrophilic, flat face that binds cellulose Figure 2, Figure 3. CBD was chosen, since the side-chains of those seven positions are constrained and have a
Conclusions

GroEL has two main activities: (i) the ability to allow the folding of aggregation-prone intermediates (such as molten globules), bound weakly by their exposed hydrophobic surfaces, in isolation within the central cavity (the “folding cage”) (Weissman et al ., 1996); and (ii) the propensity to unfold kinetically trapped misfolded proteins that then have further attempts at productive folding (“iterative annealing”) Todd et al 1994, Weissman et al 1994. These activities constitute a folding and
Bacterial strains

The E. coli strains C41(DE3), a mutant of BL21(DE3) capable of expressing toxic genes (Miroux & Walker, 1996), and TG1 (Gibson, 1984) were used.
Proteins expression and purification

The histidine-tagged (short histidine tail; sht)-minichaperones GroEL(191-345) wild-type and the mutant Y203E (Chatellier et al ., 1998) were expressed by inducing the phage T7 promoter of pRSETA vectors with isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactoside (IPTG) in E. coli C41(DE3) cells and purified essentially as described Buckle et al 1997, Zahn et al 1996a.

    Citation Excerpt :

    The well-characterized biochemical properties of GroEL are relevant to its putative role in virus transmission. GroEL binds to many proteins with very diverse linear and structural motifs [73], a property of the protein that is critical for its function as a protein-folding chaperone. Additionally, this protein is notoriously immunogenic, such that very small amounts of GroEL from bacteria of many different taxa would cross-react with polyclonal antiserum raised against GroEL proteins from other bacterial species [74,75].

    When proteins are structured, however, it becomes necessary to take into account the fact that at least some of the most aggregation-prone regions will be buried within the native structure.12,22 Since the conformations that are more likely to interact with GroEL are neither completely unfolded nor in their native states,23–26 we introduce here an approach for calculating aggregation propensities that takes into account the effects of the formation of intramolecular interactions on the aggregation process (see Eq. (4) in Methods). We applied this method to predict the aggregation propensities of proteins in the set of experimentally identified GroEL substrates described above14 (Fig. 1).
