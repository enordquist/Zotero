PREFACE
Misfolding and aggregation of proteins to form amyloid deposits is a characteristic of a number of human diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington’s, and the prion diseases. Although genetically inherited factors play a role in each of these diseases to a greater or lesser extent, age is also a risk factor, as the manifestation of these diseases reflects a breakdown in the cellular quality control mechanisms that usually ensure that proteins attain and maintain their correctly folded conformations. Understanding the protective mechanisms of the cell, as well as the pathological mechanisms of each of these diseases, is of increasing concern and importance for an aging world population. Interestingly, amyloid aggregates are also found in functional roles in a range of organisms, such as formation of fimbriae (or curli) in bacteria and epigenetic prion-like factors in fungi. Understanding how bacteria, fungi and even mammalian cells can control and utilize protein ‘misfolding’ to provide biological functions is not only a fascinating biological question, but may also shed light on the pathological mechanisms of amyloid diseases.
Protein folding, misfolding and amyloid formation is no longer considered a specialist subject, of interest only to those carrying out research in this area, but is now a core part of any advanced undergraduate or graduate biochemistry course. It is also a rapidly developing field, with a broad range of approaches being applied, ranging from in silico theoretical modelling; via biophysical, biochemical and cellular characterization of molecular mechanisms; to whole organism and systems biology approaches. Importantly, these wide-ranging approaches and techniques are being used in combination to great effect, meaning that research in this area has become truly multi-disciplinary. It is hoped that this volume will provide an accessible overview, highlighting recent progress in this field.
In Chapter 1, Louise Serpell sets the scene by providing an introduction to amyloid structure. The biophysical theme continues in Chapter 2, by Alex Buell, Chris Dobson and Tuomas Knowles, which provides a comprehensive overview of the thermodynamics and kinetics of amyloid fibril formation; and Chapter 3, by Greet De Baets, Joost Schymkowitz and Frederic Rousseau discusses prediction of aggregation prone sequences in proteins. Chapter 4, by Katharina Papsdorf and Klaus Richter, addresses the roles of the protein quality control machinery, particularly molecular chaperones, in health and disease. Chapter 5, by Ko-Fan Chen and Damian Crowther, describes the application of fly models to study amyloid diseases; and Chapter 6, by Barry Panaretou and Gary Jones, discusses yeast models for amyloid disease. Chapters 7–13 provide an overview of research on specific amyloid diseases and the role of key protein players: Chapter 7, by David Allsop and Jennifer Mayes, is focused on amyloid β-peptide in Alzheimer’s disease; Chapter 8, by Jian-Zhi Wang and colleagues, focuses on the physiology and pathology of microtubule-associated tau; Chapter 9, by Shun Yu and Piu Chan, addresses the role of α-synuclein in neurodegeneration in the context of Parkinson’s disease; Chapter 10, by Nikolai Lorenzen and Daniel Otzen, continues discussion of α-synuclein from the viewpoint of its biophysical properties and cytotoxicity; Chapter 11, by Elizabeth Meiering and colleagues discusses the role of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase in amyotrophic lateral

sclerosis; Chapter 12, by Erich Wanker and colleagues, addresses polyglutamine disease and aggregation of the protein fragment, Huntingtin exon 1; and Chapter 13, by Jiyan Ma and Fei Wang, discusses prion disease and the ‘protein-only hypothesis’. Chapter 14, by Reed Wickner and colleagues, is focused on yeast prions. Finally, in Chapter 15, Margaret Sunde and colleagues give an overview of the many functional roles of amyloids found in Nature.
I would like to thank each author who has contributed to this fascinating collection of articles. I would also like to thank the Essays in Biochemistry Editorial Advisory Panel as well as the staff at Portland Press, particularly Clare Curtis, for their guidance and assistance at all stages of this project. Finally, I would like to thank Chris Dobson and Tuomas Knowles for facilitating a 6-month sabbatical in Cambridge, coinciding with the main period of work on this volume.

Sarah Perrett is a Professor at the Institute of Biophysics (IBP), Chinese Academy of Sciences, where she has been a group leader since 2003. She obtained her undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Cambridge, where she then held a Sidney Sussex College Research Fellowship. After a year of full-time Chinese language study at the National University of Singapore, she moved to IBP in 2000, initially supported by fellowships from the Royal Society and the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. Her current research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. She has returned to Cambridge as a visiting scientist in 2005, 2009 and 2014. Her laboratory is studying the structure and assembly of functional amyloids, and the structure and function of molecular chaperones, using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques.
Louise Serpell is a Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Sussex, where she has run a research group looking at the structure of amyloid fibrils since 2003. Previously, she worked at the University of Cambridge and Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge where she did much of her early work to visualize the β-sheet structure of amyloid fibrils. She spent 18 months as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto after completing her D.Phil. in the laboratory of Dr Colin Blake at the University of Oxford, where she worked on the generic structure of the amyloid fibril.
Alexander Buell studied Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Tübingen from 2002 to 2004. He was then awarded a ‘Sélection Internationale’ scholarship to continue his studies at Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris and the University Paris VI. He graduated in 2007 with a Master’s degree in Physical and Theoretical Chemistry. He then did his Ph.D. studies with Professor Sir Mark Welland and Professor Christopher M. Dobson on the kinetics of protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils. In 2011, he was awarded a Thomas Nevile research fellowship from Magdalene College, Cambridge and in 2013, a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship, both to be held in the Department of Chemistry in Cambridge in order to continue and extend his research on the physical principles and mechanisms underlying amyloid fibril formation.
Christopher Dobson studied Chemistry at the University of Oxford, where he also carried out his Ph.D. work under Robert J.P. Williams on structural characterizations of proteins by the then emerging technique of NMR spectroscopy. He held research fellowships at Merton and Linacre colleges, Oxford and then an Assistant Professorship at Harvard University, before being appointed to a Lectureship in Oxford in 1980, followed by a Readership and Professorship. Until his move to Cambridge in 2001 to take up the John Humphrey Plummer Professorship in Chemical and Structural Biology, his research was mainly directed towards the understanding of protein folding mechanisms, to which he made seminal contributions. Towards the end of the 1990s, he became interested in the link between protein folding and misfolding that can lead to aggregation into amyloid fibrils. His research has contributed groundbreaking fundamental understanding about the causes of protein aggregation and its link with human disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease.

Currently, he is a Professor at the Center for Neurodegenerative Science and Head of the laboratory of prion mechanisms in neurodegeneration at the Van Andel Research Institute.
Fei Wang received his B.Sc. degree from Nankai University. He joined Dr Jiyan Ma’s laboratory and started his Ph.D. thesis research on prion disease in 2003. Dr Wang’s graduate work focused on the biochemical characterization of interactions between recombinant PrP and lipids. Dr Wang’s current research interests lie in molecular mechanisms of prion infectivity. Dr Wang has co-authored 14 peer-reviewed articles on prion research, including one invited methodology paper and one invited review article, and he is the recipient of the Alberta Prion Research Institute International Young Researcher Prize.
Reed Wickner majored in Mathematics at Cornell University and obtained his MD from Georgetown University. After studying yeast RNA viruses, he discovered, in 1994, that the non-chromosomal genes [URE3] and [PSI+] are yeast prions of Ure2p and Sup35p. He is currently interested in expanding knowledge of the in-register parallel β-sheet prion amyloid structure, the mechanisms by which prions cause disease in yeast, the means by which Btn2p and Cur1p cure the [URE3] prion, and the mutability of the prion cloud.
Herman Edskes obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Kentucky studying plant pararetroviruses with Professor Robert Shepherd. He carried out postdoctoral work with Dr Reed Wickner at the National Institutes of Health investigating viruses and prions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Currently, he is a staff scientist at the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Genetics and focuses on yeast prions.
