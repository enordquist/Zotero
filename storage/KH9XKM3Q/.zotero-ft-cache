Structure of the Human BK Channel Ca2+-Activation Apparatus at 3.0 Å Resolution

Peng Yuan, Manuel D. Leonetti, Alexander R. Pico,* Yichun Hsiung, Roderick MacKinnon†
High-conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels encode negative feedback regulation of membrane voltage and Ca2+ signaling, playing a central role in numerous physiological processes. We determined the x-ray structure of the human BK Ca2+ gating apparatus at a resolution of 3.0 angstroms and deduced its tetrameric assembly by solving a 6 angstrom resolution structure of a Na+-activated homolog. Two tandem C-terminal regulator of K+ conductance (RCK) domains from each of four channel
subunits form a 350-kilodalton gating ring at the intracellular membrane surface. A sequence of aspartic amino acids that is known as the Ca2+ bowl, and is located within the second of the tandem RCK domains, creates four Ca2+ binding sites on the outer perimeter of the gating ring at the “assembly interface” between RCK domains. Functionally important mutations cluster near the Ca2+ bowl, near the “flexible interface” between RCK domains, and on the surface of the gating ring that faces the voltage sensors. The structure suggests that the Ca2+ gating ring, in addition to regulating the pore directly, may
also modulate the voltage sensor.

High-conductance voltage- and calciumactivated K+ channels (BK or Slo1 channels) participate in numerous physiological processes, including neuronal excitability, smooth muscle contractility, and hair cell tuning (1–6). BK channels have an unusually high singlechannel conductance, but their most important physiological property is dual regulation through membrane voltage and intracellular Ca2+ (7–9). Depolarization of the membrane voltage and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels both cause BK channels to open, which hyperpolarizes the membrane and closes voltage-dependent channels, including Ca2+ channels, reducing Ca2+ influx into the cell. Thus, BK channels are negative-feedback regulators of electrical excitation (membrane depolarization) as well as the numerous biochemical pathways that are stimulated through Ca2+ acting as a second messenger.
The complexity of BK channel function mirrors the complexity of its protein structure. The amino acid sequence includes the integral membrane pore shared by all K+ channels, the integral membrane voltage sensor domains present in voltage-dependent channels, and also a cytoplasmic domain (CTD) consisting of approximately 800 amino acids per subunit, which accounts for the C-terminal two thirds of the entire channel. The CTD structure confers upon the BK channel its ability to respond to changes in intracellular Ca2+. It is also the source of functional heterogeneity through alternate splicing, polymorphisms, phos-

phorylation, and protein interactions, which modulate BK channel activity (10–12).
The only information currently available on BK channel structure is either low resolution from cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (13) or indirect through homology models. The pore and voltage sensors of the BK channel will undoubtedly resemble the corresponding regions of other voltage-dependent K+ channels, but the CTD structure is less certain. The BK C terminus was proposed to contain two regulator of K+ conductance (RCK) domains (14). RCK domains are found in certain prokaryotic K+ channels and K+ transport systems, but the sequence identity between BK RCK domains and prokaryotic RCK domains is so low (<20%) that homology models for the BK CTD contain a high degree of uncertainty.
Mutagenesis studies have identified the putative primary Ca2+ binding site within the BK CTD, which comprises a stretch of aspartic amino acids referred to as the “Ca2+ bowl” (15). Na+activated (Slo2) and H+-dependent (Slo3) channels, which are homologous to the BK channel, contain a similar CTD but have different sequences of amino acids in the region corresponding to the Ca2+ bowl (9). Mutations within the Ca2+ bowl influence Ca2+ activation, whereas mutations outside, spread throughout the BK CTD primary sequence, also influence various aspects of gating. These mutational data promise rich mechanistic interpretation in the context of an atomic structure. Here, we present the structure of the human BK CTD and its quaternary organization on the cytoplasmic surface of the BK channel.
BK domain organization and structure determination. The BK channel contains four identical subunits, each comprising seven transmembrane segments and a large intracellular C terminus (Fig. 1A) (16). Transmembrane segments S1 to S4

form the voltage sensor; S5, S6, and the intervening amino acids form the pore and selectivity filter; and the C terminus forms the large CTD. The locations of disease-causing mutations, alternate splice sites, regulatory sites, and site-directed mutations that alter specific channel properties are highlighted (Fig. 1B). Blue and red secondary structure elements, on the basis of the x-ray structure presented here, indicate the locations of two RCK domains (RCK1 and RCK2). The Ca2+ bowl sequence is located within RCK2.
Residues 341 to 1056 were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (sf 9) insect cells and purified to homogeneity. The excluded 57 C-terminal amino acids are not essential to function (D58 in Fig. 2D) (17). Crystals belonging to space group P6322 with one monomer per asymmetric unit were grown in the presence of 50 mM Ca2+ and diffracted x-rays to a resolution of 3.0 Å. Experimental phases to 3.3 Å were derived from a multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment with a selenomethioninecontaining crystal. Experimental electron density is shown (fig. S1A) alongside electron density (2fo-fc) calculated to a resolution of 3.0 Å by using the final model refined to Rwork/Rfree = 0.25/0.28 (fig. S1B), where Rwork is the working R factor and Rfree is the free R factor.
Structure of the BK CTD. The crystal structure defines two tandem RCK domains in the BK C terminus, shown in blue (RCK1) and red (RCK2) (Figs. 1B and 2A). Each RCK domain has a bilobed shape. The larger N-terminal lobe of each RCK domain forms a Rossmann fold, which is attached to a smaller C-terminal lobe via a helix-turnhelix connector. The tandem RCK1-RCK2 domains are folded tightly against each other, forming an interface that is reminiscent of the “flexible interface” created through the dimerization of two separate identical RCK domains in the prokaryotic MthK K+ channel (fig. S2) (18). As in the MthK RCK dimer, the flexible interface is dominated by a clasping of the helix-turn-helix connectors that attach the two lobes of each RCK domain (Fig. 2, A and B). Although the overall architecture and signature features are conserved, the BK RCK domains vary in certain details from their prokaryotic counterparts; one result of the variations is a more extensive interface between RCK domains in the BK channel.
The RCK1-RCK2 interface buries 8500 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area and has a shape complementarity (SC) index of 0.68. The SC index is a geometric measure of a matched proteinprotein interface (19). The value here is similar to that for a typical antibody-antigen interface (0.64 to 0.68) and supports the existence of a highly specific, strong interaction. This finding is compatible with experiments that show that functional channels result when two-channel fragments, separated between the RCK domains, are coexpressed in the same cell (17, 20). The extensive interface between the RCK domains supports coassembly of the individual components, which is analogous to the assembly of separate identical RCK domains in the MthK channel (18).

Two amino acid segments are not visible in the crystal structure (Figs. 1B and 2A). The absence of electron density for the long linker connecting RCK1 to RCK2 is consistent with this region being unstructured and nonessential to function. Deletion of 45 amino acids from this loop in an experiment in which two channel fragments were co-expressed in the same cell resulted in channels with wild-type properties (D45* in Fig. 2D). Past studies showed that the specific amino acid sequence of this region is not important but that it has to reach at least a certain minimum length (21). The crystal structure explains the length requirement because the end of RCK1 is located a long distance away from the beginning of RCK2 (Fig. 2A, blue dotted linker). The second unstructured region connects aQ to bO in RCK2 (Figs. 1B and 2A). A 42 amino acid deletion of this loop yields normally functioning channels (D42 in Fig. 2, C and D). Although these two unstructured segments are not essential to basic channel function, they may play a role in higherlevel channel regulation because both contain consensus sequences for binding SH3 domains (Fig. 1B) (12).
A pair of salt bridge–forming amino acids was identified in the structure of the Escherichia coli RCK domain (14). Double mutant cycle analysis of the corresponding amino acids predicted that this salt bridge is conserved in the BK channel, and this is confirmed in the structure: Amino acids K448 and D481, which are well defined in the electron density, show distances in the final model between Lys N-z and Asp O-d1 and O-d2 of 2.7 Å

and 3.3 Å, respectively, which is compatible with
a salt-bridge interaction (Fig. 2A) (14, 17, 22).
In the MthK channel, RCK dimers were proposed to undergo Ca2+-induced conformational
changes to open the pore (18, 23). Two RCK sub-
units adopted distinct relative positions across the
flexible interface in different crystal forms and as
a function of whether or not ligand was bound
(18, 23, 24). The flexible interface between two
tandem RCK domains may play a similar role in Ca2+-mediated gating of the BK channel.
The Ca2+ bowl. A major focus of research
on the BK channel has been aimed at defining the region of Ca2+ binding (8). Deletions and point mutations within the Ca2+ bowl sequence,
DQDDDDDPD, rendered the channel less sensitive to Ca2+ and caused a shift in the conductance-
voltage (G-V) curve to more depolarized membrane
voltages (15). The activation process exhibited high selectivity for Ca2+ over Cd2+, even though the ionic radius of Cd2+ (0.97 Å) is only slightly smaller than that of Ca2+ (0.99 Å) (15). Other
studies demonstrated a good correlation between Ca2+ binding to a C-terminal fragment of the chan-

nel using a radioactive Ca2+ assay and activation of the channel using an electrophysiological assay (25, 26). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the Ca2+ bowl identified the most important amino acids for Ca2+ sensing to be those corresponding to D895 and D897 in the human BK channel (26). Because of the uncertainty and disagreement in sequence-based models of the BK channel CTD, there have been different proposals for the placement of the Ca2+ bowl sequence within the context of a model that is based on tandem RCK domains (17, 27).
Experimental electron density for the Ca2+ bowl contained less detail than most of the experimental map, but the main chain was continuous, and certain side chain features emerged with cycles of model building and refinement (Fig. 3, A and B). The model was built on the basis of crystallographic data alone, independently of information from prior mutational studies. An atom that is more electron-dense than carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen accounted for the strongest electron density at the center of the structure formed by the Ca2+ bowl sequence (Fig. 3C). This was pre-

sumably a Ca2+ ion, given its presence at 50 mM
concentration in the crystallization solution. In the context of the entire CTD, the Ca2+
bowl is located between the last two b strands, bO and bP of the RCK2 Rossmann fold (Figs. 1B, 2A, and 3D). Thus, the Ca2+ bowl does not
follow but rather is an integral structural element
of RCK2. Atoms making direct contact with the Ca2+ ion include two main-chain carbonyl oxy-
gen atoms from Q889 and D892 and oxygen
atoms from the side-chain carboxylate groups of
D895 and D897. In searching the protein data-
base of known structures, we observed a similar geometry of Ca2+ binding in a high-resolution
crystal structure of calpain, which is an intracel-
lular cysteine protease whose activity is regulated by Ca2+ (fig. S3).
Because of the quality of electron density,
there is some uncertainty in the conformation of the Ca2+ binding site in our model. However, the
model is consistent with the scanning mutagenesis studies of Cox and colleagues (26). The two most critical residues for Ca2+ activation, D895
and D897, are both directly involved in the coordination of the Ca2+ ion in the x-ray structure
(Fig. 3D). The third most effective mutation in-
volved D894, which is not in direct contact with Ca2+ but forms salt bridges simultaneously with
R1018 and K1030 in the C-terminal lobe of
RCK2. D894 probably plays an important role in stabilizing the conformation of the Ca2+ bowl.
The mutation D896A, on the other hand, had almost no effect on the channel’s sensitivity to Ca2+ (26). In the x-ray structure, this side chain is directed out and away from the Ca2+ ion and does
not make other protein contacts. When the Ca2+ bowl is deleted, the BK chan-
nel is still activated by Ca2+ but with lower affinity (15, 28, 29). We have not identified a secondary Ca2+ binding site in this structure.
Quaternary structure formed by a CTD tetramer. The BK (Slo1) Ca2+- (and voltage-) activated
channel is related in sequence and structure to the Na+-activated (Slo2) and H+-dependent (Slo3) channels (fig. S4) (9). We expressed and purified
the chicken Slo2.2 CTD, which included amino
acids 347 to 1201. On size exclusion chroma-
tography, the Slo2.2 CTD elutes as a tetramer, and even under the dispersive conditions of SDS– polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
the majority of protein migrates as a tetramer.
Thus, the Slo2.2 CTD forms a very stable tetrameric complex. We crystallized this Na+-activated
CTD in the presence of 500 mM NaCl. The crys-
tals diffracted x-rays to a resolution of 6 Å and
were of space group I422, with one monomer
(subunit) in the asymmetric unit (table S1). Using
a polyalanine model of the BK CTD, we obtained
a single outstanding solution in molecular replace-
ment against the Slo2.2 diffraction data (table S2).
This solution indicates that the human BK and
chicken Slo2.2 CTDs must have very similar struc-
tures. By applying the crystallographic symmetry
operators, we obtained the tetramer structure of the
human BK CTD (Fig. 4A). This objective solution

reveals the quaternary organization of subunits but not its exact atomic details because the resolution is low and the data are from the Slo2.2 homolog.
Two main lines of evidence support the biological relevance of this tetrameric structure. First, it is immediately apparent that the ring of subunits generated by crystallographic symmetry corresponds very well to the “gating ring” observed in the MthK channel, in which RCK domains form a ring through the alternate packing of flexible and assembly interfaces (Fig. 4, A and B) (18). In MthK, both interfaces are formed between independent identical RCK domains (Fig. 4B). In the BK channel, the flexible interface is formed between the nonidentical tandem-linked RCK domains, whereas the assembly interface joins the tandem-linked pairs together (Figs. 2A and 4A). The second line of evidence supporting a biologically relevant structure comes from prior mutational studies on the BK channel (17, 30). Pairs of amino acids were shown to interact in double mutant cycles (30). These amino acid pairs, including I441-L822, M442-L825, and I445-L825, are far away from each other in the monomer but are brought close together in space through creation of the assembly interface (Fig. 4A). Even though very low sequence identity exists between the MthK RCK domain and the C terminus of the eukaryotic Slo channels, the overall three-dimensional structure of the gating ring has been conserved across evolution. As is often the case, the protein originating from the “simpler” prokaryotic organism contains higher symmetry because it is constructed from a single repeated unit, in this case the RCK domain. Because the BK and Slo2.2 structures were determined in the absence of a transmembrane pore, we cannot conclude whether the conformations are “opened” or “closed.” However, given that both proteins were crystallized in very high concentrations of the ions that activate them, we speculate that the gating ring shown in Fig. 4A approximates an open conformation.
A notable difference exists between the MthK and BK gating rings: The ligand Ca2+ is bound on the flexible interface in MthK (Fig. 4B) and on the assembly interface in BK (Fig. 4A). On the basis of the known ligand-binding properties of Rossmann folds, we should expect ligand to be bound on or near the flexible interface, where the C-terminal edges of the central b-sheets of adjacent RCK domains come close together (Fig. 2A and fig. S2, A and B). Evolution of tandem nonidentical RCK domains in the BK channel allowed the creation of a single Ca2+ binding site at the assembly interface. Helical elements aD and aE from RCK1 pack against aQ and the Ca2+ bowl from RCK2. The Ca2+ bowl probably evolved from a helix in RCK2 that corresponded to aE in RCK1. Thus, variation through evolution has brought about a fundamental difference between the MthK and BK gating rings. In BK, Ca2+ binds at the assembly interface at a site facing the outer perimeter of the gating ring (Fig. 4A).
A model for the BK channel. Guided by amino acid sequence alignments and structural compo-

nents shared by the MthK channel (18), the paddle chimera voltage-dependent K+ channel (31), and the BK gating ring, we have constructed a working structural model for the BK channel (Fig. 5 and figs. S4 and S5). The paddle chimera channel structure (residues 140 to 409) was superimposed on the MthK channel structure by aligning the main-chain atoms from the pore helix and selectivity filter (fig. S5). The pore in paddle chimera and MthK, which adopts an open conformation in both channels, superimposes with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.87 Å. The BK gating ring was then superimposed on the MthK channel by matching the secondary structural elements of the BK RCK1 domain and the MthK RCK domain. The resulting model for one subunit of the BK channel is shown with the transmembrane pore and voltage sensor in green and the gating ring in blue and red (Fig. 5A). A tetramer was generated from this model and is shown with each individual subunit in a single color (Fig. 5B). Overall, the gating ring appears to fit well against the surface of the Kv channel, with ridges from the gating ring fitting naturally into grooves that exist between the voltage sensors and the pore (Fig. 5B).
Mutations within the gating ring that affect BK channel function tend to occur in three distinct regions of the structure. One regional group surrounds the Ca2+ bowl (Fig. 6, red spheres) (15, 26). These mutations reduce the channel’s sensitivity to Ca2+ ions. A second group of mutations are scattered in the primary sequence but cluster together on the structure around the helix-turn-helix connector, which forms a large surface on the flexible interface (Fig. 6, green spheres) (17, 28, 32–34). These mutations probably affect conformational changes that occur in the gating ring associated with Ca2+-induced gating. A third group of mutations cluster on the N terminus of RCK1 (Fig. 6, purple spheres) (29, 35–39). These amino acids reside on the surface of the gating ring that faces the voltage sensor in the BK channel model.
This third group of mutations support an idea concerning dual regulation by Ca2+ and voltage. The pore is controlled directly by Ca2+ through the connection of S6 to the gating ring and directly by voltage through the S4–S5 linker and voltage sensors. But the structure and this third group of mutations raise the possibility of an additional interaction between the gating ring and the voltage sensor. One interesting experiment identified a putative Mg2+ binding site bridging amino acids on the gating ring to amino acids on the voltage sensor (39). Direct interaction between the Ca2+ and voltage sensory domains would enable one input stimulus to modulate the other in the dual stimulus control of BK channel gating.

BK Channel Cytoplasmic Domain BK channels are potassium ion channels found on the surface of a variety of cell types that are essential for the regulation of several key physiological processes, including smooth muscle tone and neuronal excitability. BK channels are regulated by both membrane voltage and intracellular Ca .2+ The channel comprises an integral membrane pore, an integral membrane voltage sensor domain, and a large cytoplasmic region that confers Ca2+ sensitivity. Now Yuan et al. (p. 182, published online 27 May; see the Perspective Weyand and Iwata) have determined the crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of the human BK channel. Four cytoplasmic regions form a gating ring at the intracellular membrane surface with four Ca2+ binding sites on the outer perimeter.
