Interaction of Hsp70 chaperones with substrates

Stefan Rudiger1.2, Alexander Buchberger1 and Bernd Bukau1.2

Determination of the structure of the substrate binding domain of the Escherichia coli Hsp70 chaperone, DnaK, and the biochemical characterisation of the motif it recognizes within substrates provide insights into the principles governing Hsp70 interaction with polypeptide chains. DnaK recognizes extended peptide strands composed of up to five consecutive hydrophobic residues within and positively charged residues outside the substrate binding cavity.

Fig. 1 Domain structure of DnaK. DnaK (top) and the crystallized DnaK fragment (bottom) are depicted as a three-domain protein with assigned functions. Filled bars indicate the L1 2, L3 ~ L4 5, L5 6 loops. Numbers indicate first or last res/dues of the domain boundaries and the DnaK fragment. Val 386-Leu 392 constitutes the linker between the ATPase and the
substrate binding domain.

oligomerization behaviour of this fragment was overcome by addition of a peptide substrate (NRLLLTG) that binds to the substrate binding pocket of DnaK with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 11 µM 37 thereby competing out the oligomerization reaction.
The Val 389-Ala 607 fragment forms a rather flat structure composed of two subdomains connected by a helical linking region (Fig. 2). The N-terminal segment (Asp 393-Lys 502) forms a compact P-sandwich composed of eight antiparallel Pstrands. The four lower strands have a regular twist commonly seen in P-sheets and are connected by short loops. The four upper strands form an unusual P-sheet with the Pl and p2 strands tilted upward by 20° relative to the neighbouring P4 and P5 strands. The upper strands are connected by two outer (13,4; 15,6) and two inner (11,2; 14,5) loops protruding upwards from the P-sandwich. The N-terminal segment is followed by ahelices A-E (Glu 509-Gln 605). Helices A and Bare packed onto the P-sandwich through hydrophobic and ionic interactions, stabilizing the P-sandwich and contributing to substrate binding. They form a linking region to the C-terminal helices C-E which, together with the C-terminal end of helix B, constitute a separate subdomain (Gin 538-Gln 605) with unknown function.
Substrate binding cavity The peptide NRLLLTG is bound to a hydrophobic cavity formed by the 13,4 and 1 1,2 loops of the upper part of the P-sandwich (Figs 2, 3). This cavity is stabilized by interactions with the 14,5 and 15,6 loops and helix B. This helix acts as a lid for the substrate binding cavity by positioning the outer 13,4 loop through ionic interactions and thus entirely enclosing the cavity (Fig. 2c). The bound peptide is in an extended conformation, in pleasing congruence with the conclusions of a previous NMR study, using a different peptide38• Extended conformations are probably the rule for peptide segments associated with DnaK given the structural constraints of the cavity.
Several types of interactions are involved in binding of the peptide to DnaK (Fig. 3). First, hydrogen bonds between the peptide backbone and the cavity-forming loops (four bonds to 13 4; one to 11 2) mediate recognition of the extended peptide conformation. 'Second, van der Waals interactions of peptide side chains with both loops as well as several P-strands confer amino-acid sequence specificity to the DnaK-peptide interaction (Fig. 3). Hydrophobic contacts exist to the five central residues of the peptide and are strongest for Leu4 which points down into a deep hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 3c). This central position within the substrate binding cavity of DnaK is defined as 'position 0'. Zhu et al. predict that this pocket, while being tailored to bind Leu, would also bind Ile and Met. Smaller residues may also bind but would pay an enthalpic penalty for not filling the pocket and Phe, being slightly too large, would only fit with an adjustment of the pocket. Tyr and Trp appear to be too bulky for binding and charged residues are unlikely to be tolerated.

It should be emphasized that contacts within the entire cavity, and not just within position 0, are involved in peptide binding to DnaK. This is supported by the finding that single amino acids are poor substrates for DnaK39. Positions+ 1 and -1 have a hydrophobic character with a negative potential at further distance from peptide backbone. Leu3 (-1) and Leu5 ( +1) are bound with their side chains orientated upwards (Fig. 3b) forming van der Waals contacts with Met 404 and Ala 429 and, for Leu3, Ser 427. At positions +2 and -2, Arg2 and Thr6 make van der Waals contacts to four and two residues of DnaK respectively (Fig. 3). At positions + 1, +2 and -2 the peptide side chains are only partly buried and, compared to positions 0 and -1, have fewer contacts to the chaperone, making it difficult to predict the substrate side-chain specificities of these positions. Furthermore, it can not be excluded that the binding of anions in the cavity, such as phosphate and sulphate may change the specificity determinants of some positions.
A third contribution to peptide binding is provided by an arch formed by residues Met 404 and Ala 429 of the substrate binding loops (Fig. 3a,b). The arch completely encloses the peptide backbone at Leu4, without contacting it, and thereby may provide a physical barrier to peptide dissociation. The flexibility of the arch-forming Met 404 side chain is restricted by van der Waals contacts to Leu3 and Leu5 which may provide additional entropic contributions to peptide binding. It will be interesting to see whether other peptides lacking Leu in positions -1 and + l also lead to arch formation in DnaK.
Fourth, Zhu et al. note that the protein surface outside the binding cavity has a negative electrostatic potential which may influence substrate association in a less specific fashion. This is now supported experimentally43•
Substrate binding motif Two approaches have been used to identify the motif in substrates recognized by DnaK. In the first approach, phage display libraries were panned to select peptides with affinity for DnaK41 . This study identified 44 hexameric sequences that mediate DnaK binding to the phages, including the sequence of the peptide used for crystallization of the DnaK substrate-binding domain. A comparison with 48 random sequences displayed on phages revealed an enrichment of Leu, Ile and Lys and a disfavouring of Phe, Glu and His. The number of binding peptides identified in this study was, however, too small to deduce the substrate recognition principles of DnaK.
In a recent study a library of 4360 cellulose-bound 13-mer peptides42 representing 37 complete sequences of proteins was screened for DnaK binding43. The peptides overlapped by 10 residues and thus presented all potential binding sites to DnaK. This approach avoids precipitation of hydrophobic peptides and allowed identification of DnaK binding sites within protein sequences and, by sequence alignment of neighbouring binding peptides, the recognition motif. The binding motif is composed of a hydrophobic core of 4-5 residues, consistent with the size of

the substrate binding cavity of DnaK, and two flanking basic segments which probably interact electrostatically with the negatively
C charged surroundings of the substrate bind-
ing pocket (Fig. 4a). The hydrophobic cores of individual binding sites consist of 2-4 hydrophobic residues in most cases, with Leu being by far the most abundant and enriched residue (Fig. 4b). Nearly 90% of good DnaK binding sites identified in protein sequences contain Leu. Acidic residues are excluded from hydrophobic cores and disfavoured in flanking regions of DnaK binding sites (Fig. 4). These characteristics fit well with the hydrophobic character of the binding cavity and the negative electrostatic potential surrounding the cavity. Based on the results of this study an algorithm was established that predicts DnaK binding sites in natural sequences with an accuracy of 84 % for all and 95 % for good sites investigated43.

Chaperone activities DnaK binding sites within protein sequences occur statistically every 36 residues43. There is no significant clustering of binding sites within polypeptide chains (except N-terminal binding sites constituted by hydrophobic signal sequences) and the sites do not show specificity with respect to origin and size of the protein. This is consistent with the promiscuity with which DnaK associates with protein substrates from E. coli and other organisms. The association of DnaK with these sites is very unlikely to involve a sliding of the chaperone along the polypeptide chain: such a sliding movement would be in,:ompatible with the architecture of the substrate binding cavity of DnaK.
The hydrophobic nature of the core of DnaK binding sites identified in protein sequences suggests that these sites are typically located in the interior of folded proteins, in agreement with earlier proposals for eukaryotic Hsp70.s27,44. Most binding sites are indeed completely buried within the folded structures of the proteins tested43. The association of DnaK with these proteins thus requires a substantial, local or complete, unfolding of the polypeptide chain. Not only the hydrophobic side chains of a binding site but also the corresponding peptide backbone needs to be separated from the remainder of the protein by at

least 10 A (Fig. 2c). Such sites may be exposed in vivo upon pro-
tein misfolding, for example, induced by heat treatment23,24, or
during the folding and targeting of newly synthesized proteins2,8. Some proteins, for example, the regulatory cr32 and RepA proteins and AP, bind to DnaK in their folded, and possibly native states22,40, 45-47. The structural features of these sub-
strates that allow association with DnaK are presently unknown.
To some extent, DnaK distinguishes secondary structure ele-
ments by recognizing primary amino-acid sequence. Screening of conformationally unrestricted 13-mer peptides for DnaK
binding revealed that good binding sites preferentially localize to

exist between Hsp7O family members with respect to

the kinetics of the ATP-controlled interactions with

substrates.

A role for nucleotides in the control of substrate

binding by Hsp7O was first indicated by the observa-
tion that the binding of ATP dissociates Hsp7O-substrate complexes26·28,55-59. For DnaK and Hsc7O it

was subsequently shown that the ADP-bound confor-

mation exhibits stable substrate binding with rela-

tively low association (k0 n) and dissociation (k0 ff) rate constants for peptides50,53,54 and protein22,53. The

ATP-bound conformation, in contrast, exhibits k0 ff values that are typically two orders of magnitude

higher than those for the ADP-bound conformation50,53,54. The k0 n values are also higher compared to the ADP-bound conformation, though to a more variable

degree (2-40-fold) depending on the particular Hsp7O and

substrate species. This coupling of nucleotide state and sub-

strate binding is also manifested by the ability of substrates to
stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp7O's by up to 2Ofold27,28,30,52.

The association of the ADP-bound conformation of Hsp7O

with substrates that are only transiently available, for example,

during folding reactions, is probably far too slow to be of phys-

iological relevance. For DnaK it was shown that DnaJ itself binds chaperone substrates4,20,22,23,60 and stimulates the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP28-30,61. DnaK in the ATP-

bound conformation is able to associate with DnaJ- substrate

complexes, followed by a stabilization ofDnaK-substrate com-
plexes through DnaJ-mediated rapid conversion of DnaK to
the ADP-bound conformation. This 'locking-in' mechanism is
probably central to the role of DnaJ in DnaK-dependent folding reactions4,22,23,62 and may be conserved within the Hsp7O family32,33. Another co-chaperone, GrpE, seems to be restrict-
ed to bacterial and mitochondrial Hsp7Osystems where it acts
as a nucleotide exchange factor. By facilitating the release of chaperone-bound nucleotide28-30 by up to SOOO-fold75 GrpE
allows the rapid association of ATP and subsequent substrate release22,63. GrpE thereby acts to speed up the functional cycle. The recent structural determination of the GrpE dimer in complex with the ATPase domain of DnaK74 reveals that one

strate binding domains64,66. Together, these results suggest that ATP triggers an association ofthe substrate binding domain with the ATPase domain (Fig. 5). These alterations cause conformational changes within the substrate binding domain itself, as evidenced by partial proteolysis analysis of DnaK66.
The C termini of Hsc7O and DnaK are dispensable for the coupling mechanism. Fragments of these chaperones lacking 96 (Hsc7O) and 101 (DnaK) C-terminal amino acids still show ATP-induced conformational changes and ATPinduced substrate release64,66,68

subunit of GrpE contracts DnaK thereby inducing a subdomain rotation of 14° leading to an opening of the nucleotide binding cleft. In addition, sturtural and biochemical findings indicate a role of GrpE in substrate dissociation, which is likely to be mediated through an interaction between the N-terminal segment of GrpE and the substrate binding domain of DnaK74. DnaJ and GrpE together provide a tight control system for the DnaK ATPase cycle and, consequently, of DnaK-substrate interactions.

Models for a coupling mechanism Several laboratories have identified mutations in the ATPase domain of DnaK and BiP that affect coupling. These mutations are all located close to the active site and result in reduced ATPase activities, presumably caused by interference with the binding of

Coupling mechanism Nucleotide-induced conformational changes have been identified in Hsp7O proteins using a variety of experimental approaches55,56,58,59,64-69. These changes occur upon binding, not hydrolysis, of ATP55,56,59,64,66,68 and thus are correlated to events leading
to substrate release. They must depend on a highly specific inter-
action of the chaperone with ATP, since they are not observed in
the absence of Mg2+ or K+, which are both required for the correct coordination of ATP70, and with ATP-analogues and ADP55,56,68,69. For bovine brain Hsc7O68 and DnaK70 it was
demonstrated by small angle X-ray scattering analysis that they are elongated prolate molecules which, upon binding of ATP,
reduce their radii of gyration by 10-15 A. Furthermore, the ATP-
induced changes in fluorescence of a Trp located in the ATPase
domains of DnaK and Hsc7O depend on the presence of the sub-
