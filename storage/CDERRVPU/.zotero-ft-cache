The Escherichia coli DnaK chaperone system is a canonical heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperone system comprising Hsp70, Hsp40, and a nucleotide exchange factor. Although Hsp40 is known to facilitate the effective binding of Hsp70 to substrates, the role of Hsp40 in Hsp70-substrate interactions has not yet been fully elucidated. Using the E. coli heat shock transcription factor ␴32 as a substrate in the DnaK chaperone system, we here provide new insight into the Hsp70-substrate interaction. When DnaK-␴32 complexes formed under various conditions were analyzed by gel ﬁltration, several DnaK-␴32 complexes with different molecular masses were detected. The results indicated that multiple DnaK molecules simultaneously bind to ␴32, even though it has been suggested that DnaK interacts with ␴32 at a molar ratio of 1:1. Two ␴32 mutants, L201D ␴32 and I54A ␴32, which have reduced afﬁnities for DnaK and DnaJ (Hsp40), respectively, were used to further characterize DnaK-␴32 complex formation. Pulldown assays demonstrated that the afﬁnity of I54A ␴32 for DnaK was similar to that of wild-type ␴32 in the absence of DnaJ, whereas L201D ␴32 exhibited an extremely low afﬁnity for DnaK. However, in the presence of ATP and DnaJ, the yield of DnaK eluted with L201D ␴32 was much higher than that eluted with I54A ␴32. These results indicate that there are multiple DnaK binding sites on ␴32 and that DnaJ strongly promotes DnaK binding to any site in the presence of ATP, regardless of the intrinsic afﬁnity of DnaK for the site.

Hsp70 is a highly conserved protein that functions as a chaperone in the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, the refolding of denatured proteins, the dissociation of proteins from complexes, and the degradation of abnormal proteins (1, 2, 3, 4). Hsp70 possesses ATPase activity and controls substrate association and dissociation via the following ATPase cycle. The ATPbound form of Hsp70 has a high substrate exchange rate and low substrate afﬁnity, whereas the ADP-bound form has a low substrate exchange rate and high substrate afﬁnity. Hsp40 acts as a cochaperone that elevates the ATPase activity of Hsp70 through a direct interaction with Hsp70 (5); Hsp40 also functions as a chaperone by binding to unfolded polypeptides to prevent their aggregation (6). A nucleotide exchange factor promotes the dissociation of ADP bound to Hsp70, and Hsp70 subsequently returns to the ATP-bound form, reducing its substrate afﬁnity (5, 7). Hsp70 induces conformational changes in its substrate polypeptides through this chaperone cycle, and the canonical Hsp70 chaperone system comprises Hsp70, Hsp40, and a nucleotide exchange factor. Although a model has been proposed in which Hsp40 ﬁrst recognizes and binds to a substrate polypeptide and subsequently transfers it to Hsp70 (7), we recently proposed another model in which Hsp70 binds to a substrate independent of Hsp40 and the interaction between Hsp70 and Hsp40 on the substrate then leads to the stable binding of Hsp70 to the substrate (8).
The Escherichia coli heat shock transcription factor ␴32 (encoded by the rpoH gene), which is required for the heat shock response, is rapidly degraded during steady-state growth at 30°C, with a half-life of 1 to 2 min (9, 10, 11). Among the ﬁve ATPdependent proteases identiﬁed in E. coli (Lon, ClpAP, ClpXP, FtsH [HﬂB], and ClpYQ [HslUV]) (12), FtsH is the major protease involved in ␴32 degradation (13, 14). However, other proteases are also responsible for ␴32 degradation (15, 16), and an E. coli Hsp70 chaperone system comprising DnaK (Hsp70), DnaJ (Hsp40), and GrpE (nucleotide exchange factor) is required for the rapid degradation of ␴32 in vivo (17, 18). It has been previously

reported that ␴32 forms a stable complex with DnaK and that DnaJ promotes the DnaK-␴32 interaction in the presence of ATP (19, 20, 21, 22, 23). In those reports, it was assumed that one DnaK molecule interacts with one ␴32 molecule. The interaction with DnaK has been suggested to induce a conformational change in ␴32 and promote its degradation by proteases (18).
Although many mutants of the DnaK chaperone system have been used to examine the Hsp70 chaperone cycle, the use of mutant substrates has been limited because the major substrates of DnaK are unfolded polypeptides that are most likely structurally heterogeneous. However, the bacteriophage P1 RepA protein that is in the native dimer form binds to both DnaK and DnaJ, and Kim et al. had located chaperone binding sites in RepA (24). As the native form of ␴32 also directly interacts with both DnaK and DnaJ, ␴32 may be a useful model for elucidating the function and mechanism of the Hsp70 chaperone system (8, 25, 26). A region of ␴32 containing Leu201 has been reported to be a binding site for DnaK (25). We also previously isolated several in vivo-stabilizing ␴32 mutants (26) and recently demonstrated that one or two substitutions at residues 47 to 55 of ␴32 reduce the afﬁnity of these mutant proteins for DnaJ (8). In that report, we suggested that two or more molecules of DnaK might bind to ␴32 in the presence of ATP and DnaJ. To gain further insight into the DnaK-␴32 interaction, in the present study, we examined DnaK-␴32 complexes in greater detail. Our results indicate that ␴32 contains multiple

Multiple DnaK Binding Sites on ␴32

DnaK binding sites with different afﬁnities and that DnaJ enhances DnaK binding, even at sites with low afﬁnity for DnaK.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and plasmids. E. coli MC4100 [FϪ araD ⌬(argFlac)U169 rpsL relA ﬂbB deoC ptsF rbsR], KY1603 [MC4100 ⌬rpoH30::kan zhf50::Tn10 suhX401 (␭pF13-PrpoDhs-lacZ)] (27), KY1456 (MC4100 dnaJ::Tn10-42) (28), and HB101 [supE ⌬(mcrC-mrr) recA ara-14 proA lacY galK rpsL xyl-5 mtl-1 leuB thi-1] were used for protein puriﬁcation. MC4100 and KY1459 (MC4100 ⌬dnaK52::cat) (29) were used for examining ␴32 stability in vivo. The plasmid pKV1142 carries the isopropyl-␤D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-dependent trc promoter (trcp), and pKV1585 is a pKV1142 derivative that carries the weak trc promoter (26). Promoterless wild-type and mutant rpoH genes with six histidine codons located at the 3= end were cloned downstream of the trc promoter in pKV1142 or pKV1585. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate plasmids carrying the rpoH gene encoding I54A ␴32-His and L201D ␴32His in which six histidine residues were added to the carboxy (C) terminus. pKV1957 (pKV1142 trcp-dnaK) and pKV1961 (pKV1142 trcp-dnaJ) are pKV1142 derivatives carrying the dnaK and dnaJ genes, respectively (8). An expression vector carrying the dnaJ gene encoding H33Q DnaJ was constructed from pKV1961 using site-directed mutagenesis. The pET3a plasmid (Novagen) carries the T7 promoter for transcription by T7 RNA polymerase and was used to construct various rpoH expression plasmids for protein puriﬁcation (8). In this study, novel plasmids carrying the rpoH gene encoding L201D ␴32 or L201D ␴32-His were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. pKV1370 is a pACYC177 derivative that carries the kanamycin resistance gene, the trpR gene, and the dnaK-dnaJ operon under the control of the trp promoter.
Media and chemicals. L broth (30) was used for cell growth, and ampicillin (50 ␮g/ml) was added when necessary. The synthetic medium used was medium E (30) supplemented with 0.5% glucose, 2 ␮g/ml thiamine, and all amino acids (20 ␮g/ml each) except methionine and tryptophan; ampicillin and kanamycin were used at a concentration of 10 ␮g/ml. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs adenosine 5=-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP␥S) and adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) were purchased from Biolog (Germany) and Roche Diagnostics Japan, respectively. Other chemicals were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Japan), Wako Pure Chemicals (Japan), or Sigma-Aldrich Japan, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Protein puriﬁcation. All the protein puriﬁcation steps were performed at 4°C.
Wild-type and mutant ␴32 and wild-type and mutant ␴32-His were puriﬁed from KY1603 cells harboring pET3a derivatives as described previously (8). It has been already shown that both I54A ␴32 and L201D ␴32 bind to RNA polymerase in vitro (8, 25) and that I54A ␴32 functions as a transcription initiation factor in vivo (26).
DnaK was puriﬁed from HB101 cells harboring pKV1957 as described previously (8), except that ammonium sulfate treatment and chromatography with a heparin column were omitted. Additionally, buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% [vol/vol] glycerol) was used for all steps.
DnaJ was puriﬁed from MC4100 cells harboring pKV1961. The cells were grown to late log phase in L broth containing 50 ␮g/ml ampicillin at 30°C, and DnaJ synthesis was induced with 1 mM IPTG. The cells were harvested after 1 h, resuspended in buffer J1 (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 10% sucrose, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 0.6% [wt/vol] Brij 58) (31), maintained on ice for 45 min, and disrupted by sonication. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 75,000 ϫ g for 90 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer J3 (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 2 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol, 10% sucrose, 100 mM KCl, and 0.5% [vol/vol] Triton X-100) and gently rotated for 60 min. After centrifugation at 75,000 ϫ g for 90 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer J3. The ﬂowthrough fraction was loaded onto an Ni2ϩ-nitrilotriacetic acid

(NTA) agarose (Qiagen) column equilibrated with buffer J3 because the authentic DnaJ protein weakly binds to Ni2ϩ-NTA agarose. After washing with buffer J4 (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 2 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol, 10% sucrose, and 500 mM NaCl), DnaJ was eluted with buffer J4 containing 50 mM imidazole. DnaJ was concentrated and stored at Ϫ70°C. H33Q DnaJ was puriﬁed from KY1456 cells harboring the pKV1961 derivative in the same manner.
All the puriﬁed proteins were Ͼ90% pure, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB). The puriﬁed proteins were quantiﬁed using Bradford protein assays (Bio-Rad). Because the functional form of DnaJ is dimeric, the indicated concentrations of DnaJ are those of the dimer form.
Pulldown assay. To determine interactions among ␴32-His, DnaK, and DnaJ, pulldown assays were performed, as described previously (8). In brief, ␴32-His and DnaK were incubated in buffer H [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM Mg(CH3COO)2] with or without DnaJ in the presence of 1 mM nucleotide at 30°C for 30 min. The protein complexes were precipitated with Ni2ϩ-NTA agarose (Qiagen), and the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by CBB staining. Gel images were captured using an LAS3000 image analyzer (GE Healthcare), and the protein bands were quantitated with Multi Gauge software (GE Healthcare).
Gel ﬁltration. Gel ﬁltration analyses were performed as described previously (8). In brief, ␴32 and DnaK were incubated in buffer G [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% (vol/ vol) glycerol, and 5 mM Mg(CH3COO)2] with or without DnaJ in the presence of 1 mM nucleotide at 30°C for 30 min. After addition of molecular mass standards (␤-amylase, 200 kDa; apo-transferrin, 81 kDa; and carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa), the mixture was loaded on a Superdex 200 gel ﬁltration column (GE Healthcare). Aliquots (15 ␮l each) from eluted fractions (500 ␮l each) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by staining with Oriole ﬂuorescent gel stain reagent (Bio-Rad). Gel images were captured using an LAS3000 image analyzer, and the protein bands were quantitated with Multi Gauge software. The fraction numbers of the eluted proteins were as follows: ␤-amylase (200 kDa), fraction 26; apo-transferrin (81 kDa), fraction 29; DnaK (69 kDa), fraction 28; ␴32 (33 kDa), fractions 32 and 33; and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), fractions 33 and 34.
␴32 stability in vivo. Cells were grown to mid-log phase in L broth or synthetic medium at 30°C. To inhibit protein synthesis, chloramphenicol or spectinomycin was added to the cultures to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 ␮g/ml or 1 mg/ml, respectively. The samples were collected at intervals and treated with the same volume of 10% triacetic acid. Whole-cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and ␴32, DnaK, GroEL, and DnaJ were detected by immunoblotting with their respective antisera. Images were captured using an LAS3000 image analyzer, and the respective bands were quantitated with Multi Gauge software.
Other methods. Nucleic acid manipulation (32), site-directed mutagenesis (33), SDS-PAGE (30), and immunoblotting (15) were performed as described previously.
RESULTS
DnaK forms multiple DnaK-␴32 complexes with different molecular masses. Although it has been assumed that DnaK interacts with ␴32 at a molar ratio of 1:1 (20, 21, 22, 23), the results of our previous study suggested that multiple DnaK molecules simultaneously bind to ␴32 (8). Thus, the present study was conceived to understand the DnaK-substrate interaction in more detail. After establishing that there are multiple DnaK binding sites on ␴32, we investigated the differences in the binding properties of these sites. Pulldown assays were performed with ␴32-His to establish the conditions for examining the interaction between DnaK and ␴32; the DnaJ concentration varied up to 1.2 ␮M, whereas the DnaK

(A and B) ␴32-His (0.4 ␮M) was incubated with DnaK (3.2 ␮M) and various concentrations of DnaJ (0 to 1.2 ␮M) at 30°C for 30 min in the presence of 1 mM ATP (A) or 1 mM ADP (B). No ␴32-His was added to the control mixture (the rightmost lane in each panel). DnaJ is observed as two bands due to the modiﬁcation during electrophoresis. **, nonspeciﬁc bands which often appeared even in lanes in which no protein was loaded. (C) DnaK and ␴32-His bands were quantiﬁed. The band intensity for DnaK in the control lane was subtracted from the band intensity for DnaK in each lane, and the result was divided by the band intensity for ␴32-His in each lane. The ratios were plotted against the DnaJ concentration. Note that values on the y axis do not indicate molar ratios. The mean values from three experiments are shown with standard errors (SE) (error bars). Open circles, ATP; closed circles, ADP.

and ␴32 concentrations remained constant at 3.2 and 0.4 ␮M,
respectively (Fig. 1). In the presence of ATP, the amount of DnaK that coeluted with ␴32-His markedly increased by more than 10-
fold as the DnaJ concentration increased (Fig. 1A and C). In con-
trast, the yield of eluted DnaK increased by only 2-fold in the
presence of ADP (Fig. 1B and C), suggesting that ATP-bound DnaK binds to ␴32 in a manner that is different from that for ADP-bound DnaK. The yield of ␴32-His decreased as the DnaJ
concentration increased in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1A). Because
the phenomenon was not observed in the case of the mixture
containing ADP (Fig. 1B), it is probable that more frequent interactions between ATP-bound DnaK and ␴32-His at higher concentrations of DnaJ sterically inhibit the approach of Ni2ϩ-NTA agarose to ␴32-His. When a mixture containing 0.4 ␮M ␴32-His, 3.2 ␮M DnaK, 1.2 ␮M DnaJ, and 1 mM ATP was incubated at 30°C for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,400 ϫ g for 10 min, ␴32-His was
hardly detected in the pellet fraction (data not shown). This indicates that the reduced yield of ␴32-His did not result from denaturation or aggregation of ␴32-His under the experimental condi-
tions used. Rodriguez et al. previously reported that the region of ␴32 that
includes Leu201 is directly involved in the interaction with DnaK (25). To further characterize the DnaK-␴32 complexes, we per-
formed gel ﬁltration assays with mixtures containing DnaK and ␴32 (wild-type ␴32 or L201D ␴32) with or without DnaJ in the
presence of ADP (Fig. 2). In the absence of DnaJ, the amount of L201D ␴32 detected in fractions 32 and 33 (in which free ␴32 is eluted) was larger than that of wild-type ␴32. This result is consis-
tent with a previous report indicating that the afﬁnity of L201D ␴32 for DnaK is lower than that of wild-type ␴32 (25). In the pres-
ence of DnaJ, the difference between the wild-type and mutant
was also observed, even though complexes with higher molecular masses were detected for wild-type ␴32. Notably, ␴32 in complexes
was primarily eluted in fraction 26, regardless of whether DnaJ
was absent or present. According to the standard curve con-

FIG 3 Gel ﬁltration analyses of ␴32 interacting with DnaK and DnaJ in the presence of ATP. (A) Wild-type or L201D ␴32 (0.4 ␮M) was incubated with DnaK (3.2 ␮M), DnaJ (0, 0.05, and 0.4 ␮M), and ATP (1 mM) at 30°C for 30 min, and the mixture was analyzed by gel ﬁltration as for Fig. 2.

structed based on the elution proﬁles of the standard proteins and
the core RNA polymerase (389 kDa; fraction 22), the deduced
molecular mass of the complexes eluted in fraction 26 was 169
kDa, which is larger than the expected molecular mass of the DnaK-␴32 complex (102 kDa). However, free DnaK (69 kDa) was
eluted in fraction 28, which corresponds to a deduced molecular mass of 107 kDa, and the only complexed ␴32 peak was present in
fractions 25 to 28. Therefore, we conclude that the complexes eluted in fraction 26 comprised one DnaK molecule and one ␴32
molecule. A similar phenomenon, in which free DnaK was eluted
in higher-molecular-weight fractions than in theory, was also ob-
served in a previous study (23). Next, to dissect the DnaK-␴32 interaction in the presence of
ATP, complexes formed in the presence of 0, 0.05, and 0.4 ␮M
DnaJ were analyzed by gel ﬁltration (Fig. 3). In the absence of DnaJ, ␴32 in complexes was detected in fractions 26 and 27. These

results are similar to those obtained in the presence of ADP (Fig. 2), though the amount of ␴32 in complexes was less than that detected in the presence of ADP. The amount of wild-type ␴32 in complexes was slightly larger than the amount of L201D ␴32 in
complexes. At 0.05 ␮M DnaJ, increased amounts of both wildtype and L201D ␴32 were detected in fraction 26. Because the concentration of DnaJ was lower than that of ␴32, this result indicates that DnaJ catalytically promotes the formation of DnaK-␴32 complexes. Intriguingly, a considerable amount of wild-type ␴32
was eluted in fractions 24 and 25, suggesting that another DnaK molecule bound to ␴32. Compared to that in the presence of 0.05 ␮M DnaJ, the amount of free ␴32 was much lower for both wildtype and mutant in the presence of 0.4 ␮M DnaJ, and ␴32 was
eluted in earlier fractions (fractions 22 to 25). This tendency was clearly observed for wild-type ␴32, and the molecular mass of the complexes containing wild-type ␴32 was larger than that of the

The proteins in fractions 20 to 24 of the gel ﬁltration analysis (conditions, 3.2 ␮M DnaK, 0.4 ␮M DnaJ, 0.4 ␮M wild-type ␴32, and 1 mM ATP) were electrophoresed with serial dilutions of the puriﬁed proteins and detected by staining with Oriole ﬂuorescent reagent.

complexes containing L201D ␴32. These results strongly suggest that there are multiple DnaK binding sites on ␴32 and that one site is located in the region containing Leu201.
To measure the stoichiometry of ␴32, DnaK, and DnaJ in the
complexes, the proteins in fractions 20 to 24 from the gel ﬁltration assay containing wild-type ␴32 were subjected to electrophoresis
along with serial dilutions of the puriﬁed proteins (Fig. 4). Because
both DnaK and DnaJ tend to self-aggregate and be eluted in high-
molecular-weight fractions, fraction 20 was used as a control, and
the amounts of DnaK and DnaJ in fraction 20 were then sub-
tracted from those in fractions 22 to 24 to calculate the molar
ratios (Table 1). The results showed that two to three DnaK molecules were bound to ␴32, whereas less than half of one DnaJ molecule was detected per molecule of ␴32.

a Data are derived from the experiment shown in Fig. 4. The intensity of the protein
bands was measured in arbitrary units (AU) with Multi Gauge software. b Amounts were calculated from the standard curves drawn based on the serially diluted
proteins. c The molar ratios of DnaK or DnaJ per ␴32 in fractions 22 to 24 were calculated using the following formula: [(amount Ϫ amount in fraction 20)/molecular mass of DnaK (69.1 kDa) or DnaJ (82.2 kDa)]/[(␴32 amount/molecular mass of ␴32 (32.5 kDa)].

L201D ␴32 is promptly degraded in vivo, similar to wild-type ␴32. Wild-type ␴32 is stabilized in dnaK mutants (17, 18), and ␴32
mutants with a reduced afﬁnity for DnaK are stabilized in a wild-
type strain (8, 26). Based on these reports and the above results, the degradation of L201D ␴32, which has a reduced afﬁnity for
DnaK, should be suppressed in comparison to that of wild-type ␴32. To distinguish plasmid-encoded ␴32 from chromosome-encoded wild-type ␴32, plasmids encoding wild-type and mutant ␴32
with six histidine residues at the C terminus were transformed
into a wild-type strain of E. coli (MC4100). The level of L201D ␴32-His was similar to that of wild-type ␴32-His, whereas the level of I54A ␴32-His was lower than that of wild-type ␴32-His (Fig. 5A), because I54A ␴32-His was expressed from the weak trc promoter.
When the levels of major heat shock proteins (DnaK, GroEL, and DnaJ) that are upregulated by ␴32 were examined by immunoblotting, they were higher in cells producing I54A ␴32-His than in cells producing wild-type ␴32-His, as described previously (26), whereas those in cells producing L201D ␴32-His were the same as those in cells producing wild-type ␴32-His (Fig. 5A). Next, the stability of ␴32-His was assessed. After chloramphenicol was
added to the culture medium to inhibit protein synthesis, the level of L201D ␴32-His rapidly decreased at a rate that was similar to that of wild-type ␴32-His, whereas I54A ␴32-His degradation was
suppressed as described previously (Fig. 5B) (26). To examine the dependence of L201D ␴32-His degradation on
DnaK, we used a ⌬dnaK mutant strain (KY1459) in which the
dnaK gene was partially replaced with a chloramphenicol resis-
tance gene (cat) (34). The replacement of the dnaK gene results in
a barely detectable level of DnaJ expression from the downstream
gene in the dnaK-dnaJ operon due to a polar effect (35). Expres-
sion vectors carrying the rpoH genes with six histidine codons could not be transformed into the ⌬dnaK strain, potentially reﬂecting the toxic effect of stabilizing both ␴32 and ␴32-His, because high activity of ␴32 is deleterious to cell growth (e.g., the gene encoding I54A ␴32, which is a hyperactive ␴32, cannot be cloned
under control of the intact trc promoter). Therefore, these plas-
mids were cotransformed with an expression vector carrying the

FIG 5 In vivo stability of ␴32-His. (A) MC4100 cells expressing wild-type (WT) ␴32-His (from a pKV1142 derivative), L201D ␴32-His (from a pKV1142 derivative), or I54A ␴32-His (from a pKV1585 derivative) were grown to mid-log phase in L broth at 30°C. Sufﬁcient amounts of ␴32-His were synthesized in the absence of added IPTG. Samples were collected, whole-cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and DnaK, GroEL, DnaJ, and ␴32-His were detected by
immunoblotting. MC4100 cells harboring pKV1142 were treated in a similar manner (Ϫ). DnaJ is observed as three bands due to the modiﬁcation during
electrophoresis. (B) The cells shown in panel A were grown to mid-log phase in L broth at 30°C. After chloramphenicol was added (100 ␮g/ml), samples were collected at intervals. Whole-cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and ␴32-His bands were detected by immunoblotting. A representative result is shown (upper panel). ␴32-His bands were quantiﬁed, and the mean values from three experiments are shown with SE (error bars) (lower panel). The values at time zero are deﬁned as 1. Circles, WT ␴32-His; triangles, I54A ␴32-His; squares, L201D ␴32-His. (C) A ⌬dnaK strain (KY1459) harboring two expression vectors, pKV1370
(carrying the dnaK-dnaJ operon) and a pKV1142 derivative (carrying the WT rpoH gene with six histidine codons), was grown to mid-log phase in synthetic
medium containing tryptophan at the indicated concentrations at 30°C. IPTG was not added. Samples were collected, and whole-cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. DnaK, GroEL, DnaJ, and ␴32-His were detected by immunoblotting. A wild-type strain (MC4100) that did not harbor any plasmid was treated in a similar manner. (D) KY1459 cells harboring pKV1370 and expressing WT ␴32-His (from a pKV1142 derivative), L201D ␴32-His (from a pKV1142 derivative), or I54A ␴32-His (from a pKV1585 derivative) were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic medium containing tryptophan at 1.4 ␮g/ml or 40 ␮g/ml at 30°C in the absence of added IPTG. Samples were collected, whole-cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and DnaK, GroEL, DnaJ, and ␴32-His were detected by

dnaK-dnaJ operon (pKV1370); because the operon is under the
control of the trp promoter, expression is inhibited after the addi-
tion of tryptophan to the medium. When tryptophan was added at a ﬁnal concentration of 40 ␮g/ml, the DnaK level in the mutant
strain was reduced by 30 to 50% after three generations compared
to that in the wild-type strain, although the DnaJ level was not
reduced less than that in the wild-type strain (Fig. 5C and D). In contrast, the levels of plasmid-encoded ␴32-His and chromosome-encoded authentic ␴32 increased due to stabilization, which
in turn resulted in an increased level of GroEL (Fig. 5C and D). We next examined the levels of ␴32-His after the addition of spectino-
mycin to inhibit protein synthesis. A control experiment was per-

formed with 1.4 ␮g/ml tryptophan to readily detect unstable wildtype ␴32-His. I54A ␴32-His was very stable in the presence of 1.4 ␮g/ml tryptophan, whereas both wild-type and L201D ␴32-His were unstable (Fig. 5E). Although the DnaK level at 1.4 ␮g/ml
tryptophan was slightly higher than that in the wild-type strain (Fig. 5C and D), the half-life of wild-type ␴32-His was longer in
KY1459 than in the wild-type strain (Fig. 5B and E). Because lower concentrations of tryptophan (1 and 1.2 ␮g/ml) resulted in lower levels of wild-type ␴32-His in KY1459 (Fig. 5C), rapid degradation of wild-type ␴32-His seems to require larger amounts of DnaK and
DnaJ in KY1459 than in the wild-type strain. An increased level of wild-type ␴32-His expressed from the plasmid (a pKV1142 deriv-

ative) may affect its stability more markedly in KY1459 than in the wild-type strain. Similar results were obtained for L201D ␴32-His (Fig. 5A, B, D, and E and data not shown). At 40 ␮g/ml tryptophan, both wild-type and L201D ␴32-His were strongly stabilized, similar to I54A ␴32-His (Fig. 5F). This result indicates that the in vivo degradation of L201D ␴32-His was dependent on the DnaK chaperone system, even though the afﬁnity of L201D ␴32 for DnaK was reduced compared to that of wild-type ␴32. These ﬁndings suggest that ␴32 stability can be regulated by DnaK binding to any
one of multiple sites. DnaJ promotes DnaK binding to multiple sites on ␴32 in the
presence of ATP. Using the I54A ␴32-His and L201D ␴32-His mu-
tants, pulldown assays were performed to examine the effects of DnaJ on the DnaK-␴32 interaction under various conditions (Fig.
6). Regardless of the nucleotide used, the amounts of DnaK that coeluted with wild-type ␴32-His and I54A ␴32-His were compara-
ble in the absence of DnaJ, whereas much less DnaK was coeluted with L201D ␴32-His than with wild-type ␴32-His. This difference between wild-type ␴32 and L201D ␴32 was more clear than that
indicated by the gel ﬁltration analyses (Fig. 2 and 3), strongly suggesting that the region containing Leu201 is the primary target
site of DnaK in the absence of DnaJ. In the presence of DnaJ and ADP, the amounts of DnaK that coeluted with wild-type ␴32-His and L201D ␴32-His gradually increased with increasing DnaJ con-
centration, whereas the amount of DnaK that coeluted with I54A ␴32-His was not altered. Interestingly, in the presence of DnaJ and ATP, more DnaK was coeluted with L201D ␴32-His than with I54A ␴32-His, though the yield of DnaK was less than that obtained with wild-type ␴32-His. Because more DnaJ was coeluted with wild-type ␴32-His and L201D ␴32-His than with I54A ␴32His, these results indicate that DnaJ binding to ␴32 strongly en-
hances DnaK binding to sites that intrinsically exhibit a low afﬁn-
ity for DnaK, in addition to DnaK binding to the site containing Leu201.
DnaK binding to each site on ␴32 requires the hydrolysis of
DnaK-bound ATP through interactions with DnaJ. The results
described above demonstrate that multiple DnaK molecules simultaneously bind to ␴32 in the presence of ATP and DnaJ. Because the binding efﬁciency of DnaK to multiple sites on ␴32 was
low in the presence of ADP (Fig. 2 and 6), it is possible that some ATP-bound DnaK molecules bind to ␴32 without hydrolyzing
ATP. Therefore, it is important to examine whether the binding of multiple DnaK molecules to ␴32 requires the hydrolysis of ATP
bound to each DnaK.
First, we tested whether direct interactions between individual
DnaK molecules and DnaJ are required for DnaK binding to multiple sites on ␴32. DnaJ contains a speciﬁc domain known as the J
domain that is conserved among Hsp40 family proteins and includes the HPD motif, His33-Pro34-Asp35. DnaJ interacts with
DnaK through this HPD motif and promotes the ATPase activity
of DnaK, and amino acid substitutions in this motif result in weak binding of DnaK to substrates, such as ␴32 (22, 36). We con-
structed a dnaJ expression vector in which the histidine codon
(CAC) at position 33 was replaced with a glutamine codon (CAG). When the DnaJ-␴32 interaction was examined by pulldown assays, the amount of H33Q DnaJ that coeluted with ␴32-His was similar
to that of wild-type DnaJ (Fig. 7A), indicating that the H33Q mutation does not appreciably affect the DnaJ-␴32 interaction. However, when the DnaK-␴32 interaction was examined in the
presence of H33Q DnaJ and ATP, the amount of DnaK that coe-

These results indicate that the binding of multiple DnaK molecules to multiple sites on ␴32 requires the direct interaction of each DnaK molecule with DnaJ.
We next examined whether the binding of multiple DnaK molecules to ␴32 requires the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP by performing pulldown assays with two nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, ATP␥S and AMP-PNP (Fig. 7C).

ing of multiple DnaK molecules to multiple sites on ␴32 requires the hydrolysis of the ATP bound to each DnaK molecule.
DISCUSSION
␴32 is rapidly degraded in cells, with a half-life of 1 to 2 min (9), and the DnaK chaperone system has been implicated in this rapid degradation (17, 18). It has been suggested that DnaK binds to ␴32 at a molar ratio of 1:1 and induces a conformational change (18, 20, 21, 22, 23). In the present study, we dissected the DnaK-␴32 interaction using L201D ␴32 and I54A ␴32 mutants and observed that DnaK forms various complexes with ␴32 in the presence of ATP and DnaJ. Based on these results, particularly the data from our gel ﬁltration analyses (Fig. 2 to 4), we suggest that three regions on ␴32 are responsible for DnaK binding, with one being the

site including Leu201. Although the other two sites remain to be delineated, they appear to be important for the regulation of the intracellular ␴32 level by the DnaK chaperone system (Fig. 5).
ADP-bound DnaK binds to the site containing Leu201, independent of DnaJ. Thus, the role of DnaJ in the DnaK-␴32 interaction at this site is to accelerate the ATPase activity of DnaK, and the direct binding of DnaJ to ␴32 is dispensable; i.e., DnaK binding to ␴32 requires only the cochaperone activity of DnaJ and not its chaperone activity.
DnaK can stably bind to the other sites only in the presence of DnaJ, and there are two possible mechanisms to explain DnaK binding to these sites. In the ﬁrst mechanism, these sites are occluded inside the ␴32 molecule, and the binding of DnaJ triggers their exposure to the outside environment. If hidden DnaK binding sites on ␴32 are exposed upon DnaJ binding, then multiple ADP-bound DnaK molecules would be expected to bind to multiple sites on ␴32 in the presence of DnaJ. However, this was not observed: DnaJ binding was not sufﬁcient to promote the stable binding of multiple ADP-bound DnaK molecules to ␴32 (Fig. 2 and 6). In the second mechanism, DnaJ promotes the binding of ATP-bound DnaK to low-afﬁnity sites on ␴32 through the formation of a ternary complex (DnaK-DnaJ-␴32) in which a weak DnaK-␴32 interaction is stabilized through both DnaJ-␴32 and DnaK-DnaJ interactions. The interaction of DnaK with DnaJ is ATP dependent (36), and the structure of ATP-bound DnaK markedly differs from that of the ADP-bound form (37, 38). These observations support the second mechanism. Because the association rate constant of ATP-bound DnaK for a substrate is higher than that of nucleotide-free DnaK (39), which has properties that are similar to those of the ADP-bound form, the faster binding of ATP-bound DnaK might also contribute to efﬁcient DnaK-DnaJ interactions on ␴32. Based on the second mechanism, we propose a model in which the multiple DnaK binding sites on ␴32 differ in their afﬁnity for DnaK and DnaK binding to sites with low afﬁnity is markedly enhanced by simultaneous DnaJ binding (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, the present study suggests that experiments with ADP-bound or nucleotide-free DnaK are not sufﬁcient to determine the substrate speciﬁcity of DnaK because ATP-bound DnaK stably binds to sites with an intrinsic low afﬁnity for DnaK in the presence of DnaJ. To clarify the mechanism of the DnaK-␴32 interaction in more detail, all the DnaK binding sites on ␴32 should be identiﬁed.
The model shown in Fig. 8A can be expanded to general substrates of DnaK or to unfolded proteins (Fig. 8B). Because the amount of DnaK in the cell greatly exceeds that of DnaJ (2), it is expected that ATP-bound DnaK cycles between associating with and dissociating from various sites on a polypeptide without ATP hydrolysis. When the DnaJ binding site on the polypeptide is exposed and DnaJ binds to this site, DnaK molecules in the vicinity of DnaJ stably bind to the polypeptide through the DnaK-DnaJ interaction, which supports the weak binding of DnaK to a lowafﬁnity site. As long as the DnaJ binding site is not hidden inside the polypeptide, DnaK repeatedly binds to the substrate. Because DnaK is a key factor in the DnaK chaperone system, it must bind to a wide spectrum of amino acid sequences on various polypeptides. Thus, for DnaK to effectively function as a chaperone, DnaK binding sites must be relatively nonspeciﬁc. The stable binding of DnaK to a polypeptide depends on the binding of DnaJ to a speciﬁc site(s) on the same polypeptide.
DnaJ belongs to the Hsp40 family (also known as the J protein

FIG 8 Model of the DnaK binding reaction. The numbers in the circles below the arrows indicate each reaction. The shades of black in DnaK indicate the intensity of the afﬁnity for a binding site. (A) Model of DnaK binding to ␴32. Multiple DnaK molecules rapidly associate with and dissociate from ␴32 independent
of DnaJ (reaction 1). When DnaK is the ATP-bound form, the afﬁnity of the binding sites for DnaK varies among the sites. The simultaneous binding of DnaK and DnaJ on the same ␴32 molecule stabilizes the DnaK-␴32 interaction and promotes the ATPase activity of DnaK (reaction 2), and ADP-bound DnaK tightly binds ␴32. Subsequently, DnaJ dissociates from the complex (reaction 3). (B) Model of DnaK binding to an unfolded polypeptide. Multiple ATP-bound DnaK
molecules rapidly associate with and dissociate from an unfolded polypeptide (such as newly synthesized polypeptides) independent of DnaJ (reaction 4). When
a DnaJ binding site is exposed on the exterior of the polypeptide, DnaK can interact with DnaJ on the same polypeptide, and ATP bound to DnaK is hydrolyzed
(reaction 5). The resulting ADP-bound DnaK stably binds to the polypeptide, and DnaJ dissociates from the complex (reaction 6).

family). J protein family members are classiﬁed into several types based on the presence or absence of a substrate (also termed client) binding domain (3), and J proteins lacking client binding activity stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 without binding to its substrate. The conclusion of the present study that the formation of a ternary complex (DnaK-DnaJ-␴32 [or substrate]) promotes DnaK binding to a polypeptide with weak afﬁnity for DnaK can also be applied to the functions of J proteins lacking a client binding domain, because in those cases, J proteins might not be free in cells but might bind to a molecule with which substrates of Hsp70 interact to form a quaternary complex, such as the J protein-ribosome-substrate (newly synthesized polypeptide)-Hsp70 complex (40). The formation of such a complex could ensure the Hsp70-Hsp40 interaction. Six J protein family members have been identiﬁed in E. coli, and 41 members have been identiﬁed in humans; in contrast, only three and 11 Hsp70 family members have been identiﬁed in E. coli and humans, respectively. Thus, organisms might have evolved Hsp40 family members with various substrate speciﬁcities to meet the demand for Hsp70 activities.
