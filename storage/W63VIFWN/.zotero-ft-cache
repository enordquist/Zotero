Abstract This study presents the ﬁrst application of the model-free analysis (MFA) (Meiler in J Am Chem Soc 123:6098–6107, 2001; Lakomek in J Biomol NMR 34:101–115, 2006) to methyl group RDCs measured in 13 different alignment media in order to describe their suprasc dynamics in ubiquitin. Our results indicate that methyl groups vary from rigid to very mobile with good correlation to residue type, distance to backbone and solvent exposure, and that considerable additional dynamics are effective at rates slower than the correlation time sc. In fact, the average amplitude of motion expressed in terms of order parameters S2 associated with the supra-sc window brings evidence to the existence of ﬂuctuations contributing as much additional mobility as those already present in

the faster ps-ns time scale measured from relaxation data. Comparison to previous results on ubiquitin demonstrates that the RDC-derived order parameters are dominated both by rotameric interconversions and faster libration-type motions around equilibrium positions. They match best with those derived from a combined J-coupling and residual dipolar coupling approach (Chou in J Am Chem Soc 125:8959–8966, 2003) taking backbone motion into account. In order to appreciate the dynamic scale of side chains over the entire protein, the methyl group order parameters are compared to existing dynamic ensembles of ubiquitin. Of those recently published, the broadest one, namely the EROS ensemble (Lange in Science 320:1471– 1475, 2008), ﬁts the collection of methyl group order parameters presented here best. Last, we used the MFAderived averaged spherical harmonics to perform highlyparameterized rotameric searches of the side chains conformation and ﬁnd expanded rotamer distributions with excellent ﬁt to our data. These rotamer distributions suggest the presence of concerted motions along the side chains.

Introduction
Over the past decades NMR has been used to great success to collect abundant experimental evidence describing the role of internal dynamics in protein or RNA function (Kay 1998; Wang et al. 2001; Shajani and Varani 2005; Boehr et al. 2006; Brath et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2006, 2007; Henzler-Wildman et al. 2007; Brath and Akke 2009). Initial studies based on backbone amide relaxation and relaxation dispersion methods have elucidated motional processes in the protein backbone occurring on the fast time scale (\sc, ns) as well as the slower time window associated with chemical exchange (Kay et al. 1989; Mandel et al. 1996; Palmer et al. 2001).
Similarly to the residue-speciﬁc investigation of mobility in the backbone, side chain disorder has also been studied with residue resolution as a result of development of NMR methodologies targeting methyl groups. Measurement of relaxation rates of 13C and 2H in isotope-labeled methyl groups are now being used routinely to understand side chain dynamics (Lee et al. 1999; Schneider et al. 1992; Igumenova et al. 2006; Tugarinov and Kay 2005, 2006; Xue et al. 2007), while methods for the quantitative interpretation of side chain order parameters are still being improved (Meirovitch et al. 2006; Showalter et al. 2007). Solid-state NMR relaxation techniques have also been used to study methyl group dynamics and suggested a high concordance between the motions for a protein in solution and in the aggregated state (Agarwal et al. 2008; Reif et al. 2006). Recent interests in the hydrophobic mechanism of folding, packing and recognition of protein-ligand, protein-protein and other protein assemblies have used 2H relaxation rates in methyl groups to describe their ﬂexibility (Mulder et al. 2002; Skrynnikov et al. 2001; Mittermaier and Kay 2002; Korzhnev et al. 2004; Eisenmesser et al. 2005; Tugarinov and Kay 2006) and residual conformation entropy of side chains (Lee et al. 2000; Frederick et al. 2006; Li and Bru¨schweiler 2009).
An inherent drawback of relaxation-based dynamics, however, is their limitation to time scales faster than the correlation time (\sc, ns) and within the chemical shift exchange (ls–ms) time window, leaving the so-called supra-sc time scale between ns and ls, believed to partially enclose folding-unfolding processes as well as conformational sampling, largely invisible to such measurements.
Nevertheless, successful observations of supra-sc motions in side chains were possible by directly measuring the dynamic averaging of NMR interaction observables. The reduction of 13C–1H dipolar couplings in side chains were measured using solid-state NMR approaches in

aggregated proteins (ubiquitin and Pf1 coat protein) and revealed motions faster than the ls time scale (Lorieau and McDermott 2006; Lorieau et al. 2008). Also, side chain rotameric interconversions up to ms were suggested based on residual dipolar couplings (RDC) measured in the side chains (Mittermaier and Kay 2001). In related fashion, using a combined approach of J-coupling and RDC measurements, a description of v1 rotamer dynamics for protein G and ubiquitin was possible (Chou et al. 2003).
Indeed, RDCs have been recognized to provide a unique perspective on the internal structural ﬂuctuations of proteins even over time scales slower than the correlation time and have thus emerged as the method of choice for studying protein backbone motions in the supra-sc time window (Meiler et al. 2001; Tolman 2001, 2009; Lakomek et al. 2005, 2008a; Bouvignies et al. 2005; Yao et al. 2008; Salmon et al. 2009; Ho and Agard 2009). The relevance of the dynamics occurring in this range was recently highlighted using RDCs, demonstrating that the conformational space attained by human ubiquitin was sufﬁcient to explain the selection of all its known binding partners (Lange et al. 2008). The model-free description of RDC-based dynamics now beneﬁts from robust analysis methods which assess the self-consistency of the dataset and circumvent the pitfall of structural noise (Lakomek et al. 2008a).
Interestingly, backbone amide RDC analysis has revealed a connection between backbone and side chain dynamics by demonstrating a correlation of the dynamics with the solvent accessibility of the side chain (Lakomek et al. 2005). The prospect of side chains transmitting their motion to the backbone can be rationalised by considering that the sampling of the rotameric energetic wells for all vn torsion angles along the side chain will cause substantial structural changes which may require some backbone accommodation to avoid steric clashes.
By extending the established approaches to side chains, this work aims to gain deeper insights into the complex ﬂuctuations of side chains in the supra-sc time window and their relationship with backbone dynamics. To this end, we present a model-free analysis (MFA) on a large RDC dataset measured from the side-chain methyl groups of ubiquitin (Lange et al. 2008, Table S7). Our results show a large amount of conformational dynamics of the CCmet bond extending into the supra-sc time window. We present a careful examination of these ﬂuctuations, assessing the inﬂuence of side chain length, residue type and solvent exposure, and evaluating their relationship to previous results. This approach promises to contribute to recent interests in side chain dynamics, particularly to understand the mechanism of folding, packing and recognition of proteins.

Materials and methods
Sample and alignment media
Wild-type 15N,13C-labeled human ubiquitin was expressed according to a previous protocol (Johnson et al. 1999) and dispersed in 13 different alignment conditions for RDC measurements. Sample conditions for which datasets 1 through 10 were collected have already been described by (Lakomek et al. 2008a). Datasets 12 and 13 are obtained from additional alignments (positive gel and Pf1 phage) not previously reported.
Sample for dataset 12: A 7% positively charged gel sample was prepared according to (Cierpicki and Bushweller 2004). A stock solution of 40% acrylamide and N,N0-methylenebisacrylamide in a 19:1 ratio was mixed 1:1 with a stock solution of 40% (3-acrylamidopropyl)-trimethylammonium chloride (APTMAC) and N,N0-methylenbisacrylamide in a 19:1 ratio. The mixtures were diluted with 109 TBE buffer (0.9 M TRIS, 0.9 M borate, 0.02 M EDTA, pH = 8.2) to a ﬁnal concentration of 7%. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of 0.15% ammonium peroxide sulphate and 1% tetramethylethylenediamine. Polymerization of the mixture was carried out overnight in plastic tubes of 3.5 mm in diameter. Gels were extensively washed in deionized water where they swelled signiﬁcantly to a diameter of 8 mm. Gels were then cut to 4 cm in length to match a ratio between length and diameter of 5:1. Gels were dried for several days on a plastic support wrapped with polyvinylidene chloride foil. To prepare the sample, the dried gel was transferred to a 5-mm microcell tube (Shigemi Inc., Allison Park, PA), *2 mg of protein were dissolved in 300 ll of buffer (50 mM NaPO4, 100 mM NaCl, pH 6.5,

0.05% NaN3) and added to the gel. The plunger was positioned to limit the ﬁnal length of the gel to 12 mm.
Sample for dataset 13: The equivalent of 5 mg Pf1 phage (ASLA Ltd., Riga, Lativa) was suspended in buffer (50 mM NaPO4, 100 mM NaCl, pH = 6.5, 0.05% NaN3) and pelleted three times at 140,000 g for 1 h. The pellet was then carefully suspended in a 15N,13C-labeled human ubiquitin sample (*2 mg) in the same buffer. NaCl salt was later added to a ﬁnal concentration of about 300 mM. The water deuterium quadrupolar splitting was 15.8 Hz.
An additional alignment condition and corresponding RDC measurements (dataset 11) were taken from the literature (Ottiger and Bax 1998, 1999). Table 1 shows the corresponding dataset nomenclature.
NMR measurements
Backbone amide group NH RDCs have been recorded and evaluated as described in (Lakomek et al. 2008a). For methyl group CH couplings, four constant-time 13C,1HHSQC sub-spectra with varying 1JCH(?1DCH) evolution delays (D1 = 0, 1/6J, 1/3J, 1/2J) were recorded in an interleaved manner using the pulse sequence described by (Kontaxis and Bax 2001). Typically, each experiment included 89 complex increments in the indirect 13C dimension for the sampling of a 16-ppm sweep width, centered at 20 ppm. All experiments were recorded either on a 600 MHz DRX Bruker instrument equipped with a 5-mm H/C/N-probehead or on a 700 MHz Avance Bruker instrument equipped with a 5 mm H/C/N-probehead.
Sub-spectra were separated, processed and co-added to yield four spectra with single peak components

corresponding to the aaa, aab/aba/baa, abb/bab/bba, or bbb coherence of each methyl group. Couplings (1JCH and 1JCH ? 1DCH) were evaluated from the separation between the four components; for precise measurement, a dedicated FELIX script was designed to perform the spectral shifts necessary to simultaneously overlay the four components. Uncertainties on the couplings have been estimated as the range of shifts for which 4-peak overlays was acceptable. Assuming fast axial reorientation, each measured methyl CH RDC (1DCH3) was rescaled to the methyl CC RDC (1DCC), corresponding to the CC bond co-linear to the rotation axis, using a universal factor of -0.3155 according to (Ottiger and Bax 1999).
RDC-based model-free analysis
The MFA applied to the methyl group data was similar to the one applied to backbone NH (Lakomek et al. 2008a, 2006). However, important modiﬁcations were required to account for the different properties of the methyl groups and are laid out here. A summary of the entire approach is illustrated in Fig. 1.

The object of the MFA is to extract the ﬁve average spherical harmonics \Y2,M[ components by inverting the equation:

where Di,m represents the measured RDC for methyl groups i in alignment media m, while the Fi,M term is a i-by-5 matrix representing the ensemble of second order alignment tensors in which the RDCs were measured. The ﬁve symmetric complex\Y2,M[ terms collectively describe the dynamic averaging of the RDC, and thus the spatial ﬂuctuation of the methyl CC vector in 5-dimensional space, and occurring on time scales faster than the ms range.
Methyl groups are too mobile to reliably determine the alignment tensors of the F-matrix from their RDCs. It is also not possible to calculate the alignment tensor exclusively from the more rigid alanine side chains, since ubiquitin contains only two of them. However, for each alignment condition, a set of NH RDCs (1DNH) from the much more rigid backbone were also available. Thus, we have used the alignment tensor estimated from the backbone NH RDCs and applied a linear scaling to the

Fig. 1 Schematics of the approach used to obtain model-free parameters for methyl groups in ubiquitin. A total of m methyl group CH RDCs are measured in i alignment conditions. The homogeneity of these alignment conditions is analyzed by SECONDA (Hus and Bru¨schweiler 2002; Hus et al. 2003). Since methyl groups undergo rapid axial reorientation (\fs) about the adjacent CC bond, RDCs are scaled down to the corresponding CCmet RDCs. For each alignment

medium i, a tensor is obtained from HN RDCs using the SCRM approach (Lakomek et al. 2008a). The tensors are scaled to CC RDCs and combined into the F matrix, which is then inverted to solve the dynamically averaged spherical harmonics \Y2,M[ for each residue. All reported order parameters represent the axial motion of the CC bond

assuming NH and CCmet bond lengths corresponding to rNH = 1.04 A˚ and rCC = 1.53 A˚ . For the NH couplings,
alignment tensors have been calculated using the software

PALES (Zweckstetter and Bax 2000) applied to the

dynamic average NH orientations obtained after four

SCRM cycles for the NH RDC data set D36M, as described

in (Lakomek et al. 2008a). Rhombicity and Eulerian angles

were assumed to remain unchanged. The 20% most mobile

NH residues as derived for datasets D36M were excluded

from alignment tensor calculation in order to minimize the

effect of alignment tensor ﬂuctuations. Since only a dynamically reduced principal component D~i;zz of the
alignment tensor can be derived from the dynamically

averaged \D(NH)[, the static value of Di,zz has to be estimated using a robust statistical scaling method that is

explained in detail in the supporting information of (Lak-

omek et al. 2008a). The same overall scaling factor S2overall ¼ 0:89 has been used. We want to emphasize that only the order parameter is affected by the scaling factor.

All other MF parameters (see below) are entirely unaf-

fected by a change in the overall scaling. Also, the rota-

meric analysis (last section) is largely unaffected by a

change in the scaling factor as long as this change can be

compensated by adjusting the local order parameter for the

fast ﬂuctuations within a minimum.

In order to quantify the similarity of structure and

dynamics in the different alignment media (homogeneity of

RDC data), a SECONDA analysis was applied (Hus and

Bru¨schweiler 2002; Hus et al. 2003) on the methyl RDCs.

The SECONDA ratio of the 5th to 6th eigenvalues gave

a reasonable value of 2.83. The ﬁfth eigenvalue of the

diagonalised F-matrix was 0.53.

The ﬁve methyl group average spherical harmonics

components were obtained from the inversion of (1). In

previous reports, the information contained in the cum-

bersome ﬁve spherical harmonics parameters was trans-

lated to the so-called model-free (MF) parameters, which

are more intuitive and can easily be related to a starting

ÀstrucÁture. These MF parameters are the order parameter S2rdc , the amplitude (grdc) and direction (/0rdc) of motional anisotropy and the average orientation polar angles

(/av,hav), and are obtained according to transformations derived in (Lakomek et al. 2006, 2008a).

For (4) and (6), the corresponding orientations are obtained by applying a second order Wigner rotation
DðM2;ÞM0 ; deﬁned by the three Eulerian angles. However, despite the fact that the MF parameters are just linear transformations of the average spherical harmonics, their interpretation might lead to problems for methyl groups, for the following reasons: (1) The side chain positions in the reference structure may sometimes be less well deﬁned because of mobility or crystal packing, making the structure generally less reliable to compare to. (2) The fourfold degeneracy of valid RDC-derived orientations combined with the high mobility may make the interpretation of their average orientation more uncertain. (3) The dynamic average orientation is the result of the averaging of the dipolar second order tensor, for which large amplitude motions may lead to ‘‘swapping’’ of principal components, and can thus not always be compared to the starting structure in which the C–C orientation is more akin to vectorial averaging. As simple examples of the last two cases, a C–C vector undergoing a 1:1 jump between a trans and a gauche? would have an average orientation (/av,hav) within the plane formed by the trans and gauche? position but outside their intervening angle (rather than exactly halfway between them). Also, a C–C vector equally sampling all three rotamers (or freely rotating axially) would have its average orientation perpendicular rather then parallel to the rotation axis, according to the deﬁnition of the MF parameters. Due to this very non-linear behaviour of averaged orientations, care must be taken when interpreting these MF parameters for comparison and validation purposes. For these reasons, we also invoke the average spherical harmonic terms \Y2,M(h0,/0)[ for modeling the motional heterogeneity of side chains.
For the quality estimation of the MFA ﬁt to the measurements, the RDCs were back-calculated from the average spherical harmonics. As quality criteria, for

residue i, the root mean square deviation over all alignment media between the back-calculated and the measured RDCs (\rmsd(rdc,i)[) were determined. In addition, for each alignment medium m, the dynamic Q-values (\Qdyn,m[) were determined to compare the

RDCs back-calculated from the MFA spherical harmonics to the experimental RDCs (Lakomek et al. 2008a; Table S1, Supplementary Information) and are deﬁned analogously to the standard Q-value (Bax and Grishaev 2005). Errors for the ﬁve MF parameters (S2rdc, /av, hav, grdc, /0rdc) were calculated by adding Gaussian noise to the measured RDCs. The input RDCs with added noise Di,m,noise were generated by drawing N = 1,000 random samples Di,m,noise = randomp(Di,m) from a Gaussian distribution p(D) with standard deviation ri. Both the experimental error and the residue-speciﬁc rirmsd = rmsd(rdc,i) values were used to assess the combined effect of experimental error and additional systematic errors introduced by the MFA.
Rotameric analysis
A Matlab7 (Mathworks, MA) script was designed to perform a grid search in order to model the full side chain rotameric sampling of valines (V5, V70), isoleucines (I3, I36, I44, and I61) and leucines (L8, L67) over the fs-ms time range based on two average spherical harmonics sets (ten parameters) from their Cc and/or Cd RDCs. The protocol searches populations of ideal rotamers in trans (tr), gauche? (g?) and gauche- (g-) of v1 and v2 angles and computes the average spherical harmonics based on the following expressions:

where the terms p1xx represent populations between 0 and 1 for torsion angle v1 in ideal rotamer xx = [tr, g?, g-] and

the terms p2yy|1xx represent populations of v2 in ideal

rotamer yy when v1 is in ideal rotamer xx. The isotropic

general order parameters Sc and Sd are terms representing

performed for valines on three variables (p1tr, p1gþ ; Sc) in

increment steps of (0.02, 0.02, 0.01) and on isoleucines on

0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05). The grid search on

leucines was performed as for isoleucines, except that the

one. In certain cases, where relaxation-based order

Results
MF-derived side chain dynamics
The order parameters derived from the average spherical harmonics obtained from methyl group RDCs measured in 13 different alignment conditions according to the MFA are plotted in Fig. 2. Of the 50 methyl groups in ubiquitin, 37 gave rise to order parameters and MF parameters. Residues for which RDC data was too sparse, as indicated by a small 5th eigenvalue (\0.35) of the F-matrix, were rejected. This affected the following residues: Thr7(Cc1), L15(Cd1), V17(Cc1), I23(Cd1), V26(Cc2), I30(Cd1), L43(Cd1 ? Cd2), Thr55(Cc1), L56(Cd1), Thr66(Cc1), L69(Cd1), and L71(Cd1). Dynamic Q-values have been calculated (see

Supplementary Information, Table S1). The average dynamic Q-value is \Qdyn[ = 0.13.
The range spanned by the methyl axial order parameters shows striking heterogeneity in methyl group dynamics. They vary from very rigid (e.g., S2rdc * 1 for A28 (Cb), I44(Cc2) and A46(Cb) to very mobile [e.g., S2rdc * 0.05 and 0.1 for L69(Cd1) and L8(Cd1)]. The mean order parameter over all measured methyl groups in ubiquitin is S2rdcCC ¼ 0:43 with a standard deviation of r = 0.25. This value is much lower than the average order parameter measured on the more rigid backbone NH groups on the same protein and under the same conditions (\S2rdc(NH)[ = 0.72 ± 0.02; Lakomek et al. 2008a).
The magnitude of errors is larger for methyl groups than for NH backbone amide groups (errors for DNH were estimated to be 0.3 Hz or less). The ﬁrst reason is a limited resolution of the RDC measurements using a constant-time HSQC (Kontaxis and Bax 2001) with the limited maximum evolution time corresponding to approximately 15 Hz resolution compared to better than 2 Hz resolution for NH groups measured on a normal HSQC (without zero ﬁlling). Secondly, the coverage of the ﬁve-dimensional RDC space is less complete than for the NH measurements, as indicated by a lower 5th eigenvalue of the F-matrix. Although the combined effect of both errors propagates, a quantitative analysis of the results was still possible.
Three notable order parameters have values larger than 1, based on the MF theory. Those correspond to methyl groups of A28 (Cb), I44(Cc2) and A46(Cb). Whereas such values are impossible in reality, they are still within experimental error in the allowed range for order parameters (0–1). For statistical purposes, these three order parameters were corrected to the maximum physical value of 1.
In Fig. 2b, the MF parameter grdc is shown for each methyl group in ubiquitin. This parameter represents the anisotropy of motion, assuming values from 0 (perfectly axially symmetric motion) to H (fully anisotropic). This parameter, in combination with the order parameter, is useful for differentiating complex types of motions; for example, deciphering those dominated by two or three rotameric jumps or by libration motion. Also for the amplitude of anisotropy grdc, a large heterogeneity is observed, with variations seen from 0.04 ± 0.05 (V17(Cc2)) to 0.83 ± 0.15 (L71(Cd1)).

Validation of MFA
As shown in Fig. 2a, methyl groups located at positions distant from the rigid backbone are more mobile and show smaller S2rdc. This is expected since their orientational ﬂuctuation will depend on the combined rotameric jumps of all intervening torsion angles between the methyl group

and the backbone. It is also known that the ﬁrst v1 angle (N–Ca–Cb–Cc) has a preference for the gauche- position (-60°) due to steric hindrance with the backbone (Janin et al. 1978), whereas similar effects are less pronounced for all subsequent torsional angles (v2,v3,…). Similar properties have been seen already from relaxation studies of protein side chains, in which there is a general tendency for decreasing order parameters with increasing distance from the backbone (LeMaster 1999; LeMaster and Kushlan 1996; Houben and Boelens 2004; Mittermaier et al. 1999). The extent of anisotropy (Fig. 2b) can also be quite revealing; for instance, it is expected that geminal methyl groups of leucine and valine side chains not only have similar order parameters but also similar motional anisotropy in the simplistic model where their mobility depends on a single torsion angle. However, exceptions would be expected for cases where adjacent side chain and backbone dihedral angles undergo substantial concerted motion. In the following, these and other MF parameters for methyl groups are examined in the context of their distance to the backbone, of residue type and of solvent accessibility.
Isoleucines
For the isoleucine residues, a tendency is observed for the Cd1 methyl groups attached to Cc1 to be more mobile than those at Cc2. Since the Cd1 methyl groups are further away from the backbone than the Cc2 methyl groups this increased mobility does not come as a surprise. It can be observed for I3 in the ﬁrst b-strand with S2rdc(Cc2) = 0.67 ± 0.15 [ S2rdc(Cd1) = 0.30 ± 0.19, I44 in the third b-strand with S2rdc(Cc2) = 1.25 ± 0.44 [ S2rdc(Cd1) = 0.13 ± 0.06 and I61 in loop region with S2rdc(Cc2) = 0.72 ± 0.12 [ S2rdc(Cd1) = 0.37 ± 0.18.
All three residues, I3, I44 and I61, also show substantial differences in amplitudes of anisotropy: g(Cc2) = 0.73 ± 0.13 and g(Cd1) = 0.27 ± 0.10 for I13, g(Cc2) = 0.18 ± 0.08 and g(Cd1) = 0.56 ± 0.11 for I44 and g(Cc2) = 0.08 ± 0.06 and g(Cd1) = 0.26 ± 0.12 for I61.
Alanines
Only two alanine residues are present in ubiquitin, at positions 28 and 46. Alanine residues have a short side chain with the methyl groups directly attached to the backbone. The Ca–Cb axis motion does not depend on any side chain dihedral angle and only ﬂuctuates along with backbone motions. Both A28 and A46 show the highest order parameters with S2rdc(Cb) = 1.38 ± 0.47 and S2rdc(Cb) = 1.09 ± 0.26, respectively. Whereas A28 is located in the rigid a-helix (S2rdc(NH) = 0.85 ± 0.06), A46 is at the slightly less rigid interface between the b4-strand and the following loop.

Valines
Of the four valines present, only two (V5 and V70) yield both Cc1 and Cc2 data. Both for V5 and V70, the S2rdc(Cc1) and S2rdc(Cc2) order parameters have almost identical values. While for V70, the amplitudes of anisotropy grdc are very similar, those for V5 were somewhat different with g(Cc1) = 0.28 ± 0.19 and g(Cc1) = 0.05 ± 0.09, although they are equivalent within the experimental error. However, since V5 is involved in the packing of the core, the presence of concerted motions cannot be ruled out. V70 is also the only valine of the four to exhibit some solvent exposure; accordingly, it has the lowest order parameters of the four (S2rdc(Cc1/Cc2) = 0.27/0.22 vs. 0.41/0.39 (V5), –/0.82 (V17), 0.62/– (V26)) and the highest level of anisotropy (grdc(Cc1/Cc2) = 0.48/0.45 vs. 0.28/0.05 (V5), –/0.04 (V17), 0.10/– (V26)), suggesting the sampling of more than one rotameric states about the v1 torsion angle.
Leucines
For four leucines, L8, L50, L67, and L73, RDC-based order parameters were available both for Cd1 and Cd2. For L8, L50, and L67, S2rdc(Cd1) and S2rdc(Cd2) were identical within the error. The same also holds for the amplitudes of anisotropy. This indicates isotropic behavior for the leucines apart from L73 in the very ﬂexible C-terminal part of ubiquitin. L73, being very mobile, shows a statistically signiﬁcant difference both in order parameter and amplitude of anisotropy with S2rdc(Cd1) = 0.05 ± 0.04 and S2rdc(Cd2) = 0.18 ± 0.06 and g(Cd1) = 0.83 ± 0.15 and g(Cd2) = 0.14 ± 0.11. The difference in g looks very dramatic, however, it must be realized that in this case, big differences in g can occur even if the motion of the two methyl groups is not vastly different, given the very low order parameter.
Geminal methyl groups
The S2rdc(CC) measurements do not show large signiﬁcant differences for geminal methyl groups in the two valines and four leucines for which both order parameters were available, except for the very ﬂexible L73. The question whether geminal methyl groups exhibit similar mobility in proteins has been addressed by several different methods, but has led to conﬂicting interpretations. A study on 13C–13C cross-relaxation on serine-protease PB92 (Houben and Boelens 2004) reports consistently higher order parameters for the methyl group that is trans in the main chain as compared to the methyl group that is gauche. In support of this, relaxation studies on thioredoxin (LeMaster and Kushlan 1996; LeMaster 1999) have led to the observation of important differences in S2, which were

123

31

interpreted as concerted motions. This effect has however been observed to a much smaller extent from 2H-relaxation measurements for various other proteins (Millet et al. 2003; Mittermaier et al. 1999; Flynn et al. 2001). For ubiquitin, there is no indication of this behaviour from 2H-relaxation measurements either. Interestingly, the anisotropy of motion g (Fig. 2b) show some differences for geminal methyl groups and could also underline the presence of different dynamic properties. This point is addressed again in the rotameric analysis (vide infra).
Solvent accessibility
Neglecting the two alanines and the Cc for I44 which have unusually large order parameters, a correlation between the side chain solvent-accessibility and the side chain mobility can be observed (Fig. 3a). The correlation coefﬁcient between solvent-accessibility and S2rdc(CC) order parameters is r = -0.501. The side chains which are more solvent-accessible show a tendency to be more mobile.
Distance to backbone
Looking at the methyl group order parameters for all residues, there is a very clear correlation between mobility and distance to the backbone as shown in Fig. 3c. Methyl

groups separated by two torsion angles (Cd1 and Cd2, depending on v1 and v2) have a mean order parameter of only 0.25 compared to 0.52 for those separated by only one torsion angle (Cc1 and Cc2, depending only on v1). As seen above, the alanines Cb have much higher order parameters with a mean value of 1.
Average orientation
Another validation comes from the MF parameters (/av, hav) which represent the polar angles of the average orientation of the C–C bond within the frame of the ubiquitin reference structure. It is expected that for those methyl groups with low mobility (high order parameter), the average orientation lies close to the corresponding orientation deﬁned from the electron density in the reference crystal structure, especially if those are well-deﬁned and unaffected by the crystal packing effects. It would also be expected that for more mobile methyl groups, this correlation would weaken due to the nature of the averaging effect of second order tensors explained earlier in the Materials and Methods section. Figure 3b shows the relationship between the order parameter and the angle between the average orientation deﬁned from the X-ray structure (pdb code:1ubi). There is indeed a strong tendency for the MFA to yield a similar orientation of C–C

bonds relative to the crystal structure for the more rigid methyl groups. Except for A28 and L69, all methyl groups with S2rdc [ 0.45 are predicted within 20° of the reference. Conversely, for all other methyl groups with lower order parameter, an even distribution of angles is observed within the allowed range from 0° to 90°, due to the averaging properties of second order tensors.

MFA detects important supra-sc motion in the side chains

Previous studies have reported on the dynamics of methyl

groups in ubiquitin using different techniques. It is of

interest to compare these results with the RDC-based order

parameters reported here. It is important, however to

highlight the differences between the various approaches

with regards to the time scales as well as the conforma-

tional space sampled by the methyl group motion.

Order parameters were measured (Lee et al. 1999) from 2H relaxation on selectively 2H-labeled ubiquitin under

conditions very similar to ours in concentration, composi-

tion and temperature. As for the RDC-based order parameters, the relaxation-based order parameters, S2LS(CC) [subscript LS for Lipari-Szabo, in reference to (Lipari and

Szabo 1982)], reﬂect motional ﬂuctuations of the methyl

axial CC bond relative to an external reference frame, but

with the important difference that the time scale sampled

by these motions is strictly faster than the correlation time

(sc) of ubiquitin corresponding to about 4 ns. Since RDCbased order parameters are additionally susceptible to the

motions over time scales 5–6 orders of magnitude slower

than sc, it is generally expected that the condition:

S2LSðCCÞ ! S2rdcðCCÞ

ð10Þ

will be respected for every methyl group, in a similar fashion than what has been described for backbone amide groups when comparing relaxation and RDC-dynamics data (Lakomek et al. 2005, 2006, 2008a, 2008b; Lange et al. 2008; Meiler et al. 2000, 2001). It is however, ÀnoteworÁthy to mention that, whereas the overall scaling S2overall of amide order parameters, S2rdc(NH), strictly depends on the corresponding condition (S2LSðNHÞ ! S2rdcðNHÞ within the experimental error), no additional scaling is used here for the methyl groups, since the alignment tensor is predetermined from the amide order parameters (which already include this condition).
The relaxation-based order parameters are represented in a correlation plot against the corresponding model-free RDC-based order parameters from our analysis and on a per-residue context in Fig. 4a and b. In both ﬁgures, for all but a single residue, the condition described by (10) is respected within the error ranges. It can also be appreciated from those ﬁgures that the S2rdc is much smaller than S2LS for

a large majority of residues. Not surprisingly, this indicates

that there are very important additional motions present in

the ns–ls time scale, which are invisible to relaxation. The

mean and standard deviation for corresponding sets of

m ethyl groups are S2LSðCCÞ ± r = 0.66 ± 0.25 and

S2rdcðCCÞ ± r = 0.43 ± 0.25. An estimDate of the exEtent

oSf 2rdtchðeCCsuÞpraS-s2LcS

order ðCCÞ

parameters gives ¼ 0:69 indicating

S2nsÀlsðNHÞ that there

¼ is

almost as much mobility present in the suÀpra-sc as inthe

sub-sc ranges for methyl groups S2fsÀnsðCCÞ ¼

S2LSðCCÞ ¼ 0:66Þ: This supra-sc mobility of the methyl

groups has much larger amplitude than what was observed

for amide groups in the same time window. From a similar

comparison, the respective amount of backbone motion in

Dthe supra-sc Eregion was observed to be on the order of S2nsÀlsðNHÞ = 0.93 (Lakomek et al. 2008a). Despite
these large differences, the order parameters on both scales

show a correlation coefﬁcient of r = 0.72, suggesting that

a fair portion of the additional mobility in the supra-sc region can be interpreted mostly as a ‘‘broadening’’ of the

amplitude of motion.

A simple analytical method was proposed to back-pre-

dict methyl group Lipari-Szabo-type sub-sc order parameters from static protein structures based on the distribution

of local contacts around methyl carbons and the number of

v angles to the backbone (Ming and Bru¨schweiler 2004).

Interestingly, since a similar correlation coefﬁcient is

obtained from the back-predicted order parameters, (indi-

vidual data not shown, correlation coefﬁcient r = 0.66), it

is reasonable to suppose that this simple local contact

model would also apply in the supra-sc time window. A second set of order parameters, S2SLF, comes from
solid-state NMR measurements of the dynamic averaging of

the CxH dipolar couplings, adjacent to a CxCmet bond, using separated local ﬁeld (SLF) methodologies on ubiquitin in

microcrystalline form undergoing magic-angle spinning

near ambient temperatures (Lorieau and McDermott 2006).

It is reasonable to expect that the adjacent CxH and CxCmet bonds would have similar mobility, assuming that concerted

motions are not dominant. Despite the important difference

in the sample conﬁguration, the averaging of the dipolar

couplings in solids or of the residual dipolar couplings in

solution is susceptible to motions including the supra-sc (faster than ls for SLF, faster than ms for RDCs). The

SLF generalized order parameters reported as |S| =

|\P2(cosh)[| represents the coefﬁcient of reduction of the corresponding static CH dipolar coupling. For comparison

with our order parameters, these coefﬁcient were squared, giving |S|2 = S2SLF.
Figure 4c and d show the correlation between methyl

groups and the corresponding methine and methylene

groups (in the solid state) for which both dynamic

parameters were measured using the two different methods.

SS-NMR are much closer to that of the RDC-based order parameters S2SLF = 0.48 vs. S2rdc = 0.43. Furthermore, we see agreement within error ranges for over 61% of the
order parameters using SLF. The correlation coefﬁcient r in
this analysis is 0.38 which indicates that there is quite a bit
of variation in the differences between the solid-state
derived order parameters and the ones derived from our
MFA. The rmsd is with 0.24, however, relatively low. Another relevant set of order parameters, S2J;D, available
in the literature are those obtained indirectly for methyl
groups at position Cc using 3-bond J-couplings and a set of RDCs from two alignment media by (Chou et al. 2003).
From the rotameric angular distributions obtained from
grid search protocols, the corresponding order parameters ranges for each residue were back-calculated. S2J;D represents the intersecting range between J-coupling- and RDC-
based ensembles of rotameric solutions. Since these order
parameters sample the same time scales as those presented
here, they are expected to ﬁt in the optimal way to the
model-free order parameters derived here. Of course, there
are differences in the sensitivity of the involved observ-
ables to certain motions. For example, the J-coupling
averaging is, to a ﬁrst approximation, only susceptible to
axial ﬂuctuation about the Ca–Cb bond, such as rotameric jumps of the v1 torsion angle. They are insensitive to the orientational ﬂuctuation of the Ca–Cb axis itself and because of the nature of the Karplus curves, especially
around the gauche positions, they are rather insensitive to
fast ﬂuctuations around each rotameric equilibrium posi-
tion. In contrast, RDCs are sensitive to all types of ﬂuc-
tuations as long as the 5-dimensional space is properly
represented, owing to sufﬁciently linearly independent
alignment media. Despite these important differences, the overall correlation between these S2J;D order parameters and our model-free S2rdc is rather good with a correlation coefﬁcient of r = 0.58 and an rmsd of 0.28.
Most striking, however, is the observation of S2J;D [ S2rdc in all available cases as seen in Fig. 4e, f. The obvious
interpretation is that the rotameric jump model only
explains part of the mobility experienced by the Cb–Cc bond. Just like the S2rdc=S2LS ratio deﬁnes the temporally distinct supra-sc order parameters, the S2rdc=S2J;D ratio could deﬁne a geometrically distinct libration order parameter
around the equilibrium positions. For instance, I30(Cc1) is predicted to mostly sample a single rotamer with the gauche- rotamer dominating the v1 distribution, based on S2J;D ¼ 0:86. This same methyl group is however, quite mobile based on S2rdc (0.48 ± 0.20). Interestingly, the backbone at that position over the same time scale is relatively ﬂexible based on S2LS (NH) = 0.78, which would suggest that some of the mobility would be due to ‘‘wob-
bling’’ of the Ca–Cb bond with the backbone. Nevertheless, for other residues where the Cc undergo signiﬁcant

rotameric interconversions, S2J;D is exquisitely sensitive to supra-sc motions. Notably, the S2J;D were signiﬁcantly lower than the S2LS (CC) for several residues in the ﬁrst pair of ubiquitin’s anti-parallel b-strand, indicating that rotameric averaging on a time scale slower than the rotational correlation time is taking place.
Despite already good agreement, we could improve the correlation between the two independently determined order parameters even further in the following way: We multiplied the rotamer-based order parameter S2J;D(CCi) with a local backbone order parameter, S2LS(NHi) or S2LS(NHi?1), representing small-scale rapid ﬂuctuation (compare Fig. 4g, h). Slightly better agreement is obtained using the following NHi?1 order parameters (Fig. 4g, h, residue i ? 1, red, rmsd = 0.18 and r = 0.63) compared to those from the previous NHi (Fig. 4g, h, residue i, green, rmsd = 0.22 and r = 0.47). This result indicates that both rotameric sampling and fast small-scale libration around equilibrium positions generally have an important contribution to the overall mobility of the CCmet bond. With this correction of the S2J;D(CCi) order parameters, they ﬁt with the largest correlation coefﬁcient r and the smallest rmsd to the order parameters derived from our MFA.
Correlation between S2rdc(CC) and S2rdc(NH)
Extending the investigation of side chains dynamics to the supra-sc time windows reveals substantial additional mobility slower than sc, which is likely to be composed of rotameric jumps around torsion angles and of small-scale rapid ﬂuctuations around equilibrium positions. Whereas the mechanism underlying these motions is too complex to decipher with the approach used in this study, it would be intriguing to study whether these substantial movements might have an effect on the motions at the level of the backbone, especially considering that the important rearrangements associated with rotameric jumps may require local structural accommodations even from the backbone. Mechanisms of such transfer of motion have already been suggested and applied to improve side chain conformational variability models (Davis et al. 2006; Friedland et al. 2008).
Recently, a tendency was observed that residues with solvent exposed side chains appear more mobile in protein backbone. A transfer of motion from the side chains to the protein backbone had already been hypothesized (Lakomek et al. 2005). Due to the lack of dynamic information for the side chains, conclusions were based on the assumption that solvent-exposed side chains were more mobile than those in the core of the protein. Now that direct experimental information about side chain dynamics in a time window from pico- to milliseconds becomes available, it is of interest to investigate whether there is a direct correlation

between the order parameters of the methyl groups and those of the backbone amides to which they are directly bonded.
In Figure 5a and b, the order parameters of methyl groups are plotted against the order parameters of the same (i) and of the following (i ? 1) NH group over different time scales and the linear correlation coefﬁcients are summarized in Table 2. For pairs of values where the correlation is deemed ‘‘signiﬁcant’’ based on p-values smaller than 0.1 (probability that this correlation would occur by chance, in brackets), a few observation can be made. On all time scales, S2(CCi) show better correlation with S2(NHi) than with S2(NHi?1). This is the case for fs-ms dynamics with Pearson coefﬁcients of ri = 0.49 and ri?1 = 0.34, as well as for fs-ns dynamics risub = 0.60 and risþub1 = 0.41. These numbers show that a possible mechanism of transfer of motion from the side chain to the backbone is more prevalent from the side chain to the amide group of the same residue than to the next one as has been postulated earlier (Lakomek et al. 2005).
When classifying the data according to the distance of the methyl group to the backbone, it seems that the order parameters at the Cc methyl show practically the same correlations to the amide motion on the same residue as the Cd methyl groups (e.g., ri(c) = 0.50 vs. ri(d) = 0.46). The

slope of the linear correlation is, however, roughly twice for Cd compared to Cc, indicating that the methyl group motion transfer are signiﬁcantly dampened through the degrees of freedom of the linear side chain.
When comparing the correlation of motion between side chains and backbone for the fast (ps to ns) to the full (ps to ms) time window detected by RDCs a better correlation from faster motions is obtained. This suggests that the major contribution of this transfer already occurs at timescales faster than the correlation time (sc). These ﬁndings encourage further investigations of a possible transfer mechanism of motion from the side chains to the protein backbone.
Correlation between MFA and dynamic ensembles
In recent years, a number of independent computational ensembles have been calculated to fulﬁll both structural restraints and dynamical information (Clore and Schwieters 2004, 2006; Markwick et al. 2007; Lindorff-Larsen et al. 2005; Richter et al. 2007; Lange et al. 2008; Friedland et al. 2009). From a number of available ubiquitin ensembles, we have back-calculated the average spherical harmonics and related MF parameters and compared them to the new data presented in this study. Thus, further

Fig. 6 Order parameters plotted against residue position as back-calculated from different structural ensembles (blue: 1d3z, green: 2nr2, yellow: 1xqq, red: 2k39, cyan: ‘‘backrub’’-ensemble (brub), black: MFA)

insight into the conformations adopted by the side chains, especially in the ns-ms time scale can be obtained. Data for the ensembles of structures used here are presented in the Table 3.
Figure 6 displays a per-residue comparison of the order parameters from the highly restrained lowest-energy average NMR structures (pdb:1d3z), from the three dynamically-reﬁned ensembles (pdb:1xqq, 2nr2 and 2k39) and from the ‘‘Backrub’’-generated ensembles (‘‘brub’’) with those obtained from the MFA. While the pdb:1d3z structure can be considered as a good approximation for the average structure in solution for the backbone (Cornilescu et al. 1998), our results indicate that a single structure representation is not appropriate to describe the large amplitude side chain motions observed for ubiquitin. Not surprisingly, all the order parameters for this ensemble are larger than those from the MFA. Accordingly, the ﬁt of the back-calculated order parameters with the experimental

ones is the worst, both in terms of correlation factor (r) as

well as rmsd as shown in Table 3.

In comparison, the dynamic ensembles pdb:1xqq and

pdb:2nr2 show a much higher level of conformational

heterogeneity, by virtue of their reﬁnement against not only

backbone but also side chain (methyl group) relaxation-

based order parameters. However, as discussed previously,

these order parameters are insensitive to supra-sc motion. Predictably, the back-calculated order parameters from

these ensembles do not reproduce very well those acquired

from RDCs, which are smaller for the largDe majorityE of

residues. The averageD order paErameters

2nr2
bÂoth signiﬁcantly larger thanÃ the average from the MFA S2rdcCC ¼ 0:43 ðr ¼ 0:25Þ : Agreement within error

ranges only occur in 33% of the cases.

The EROS ensemble (pdb:2k39) is also a dynamically

reﬁned structure, with the important difference that the

123

ensemble reﬁnement is not performed against order parameters but rather against orientational restraints provided from RDCs (including backbone DNH and methyl group DCC). As a consequence, it is anticipated that the conformational heterogeneity present in the ensemble reﬂect ﬂuctuations over a wider time scale (fs-ms).
Of the ﬁve ensembles, the pdb:2k39 boasts together with pdb:1xqq the best correlation (Pearson correlation r = 0.857) and by quite a big margin the best overall agreement (rmsd = 0.04h9D6) with thEe MFA results. Thie average order parameter S2 ðCCÞ ¼ 0:45 ðr ¼ 0:29Þ
2k39
is almost identical to the average from the MFA. Agreement is present in 66% of the residues measured. Despite the high ﬂuidity reproduced in the Lipari-Szabo-based dynamic ensembles, this supports that there is a large amount of motion that is not sampled by relaxation techniques because it occurs in the ns-ms time scale.
The ‘‘Backrub’’-generated ensemble (brub) is an ensemble of ubiquitin structures in solution that is created by sampling conformational space without experimental information using the ‘‘Backrub’’ motions, inspired by alternative conformations observed in sub-Angstrom resolution crystal structures (Davis et al. 2006). An ensemble of 50 Backrub-generated structures was selected to optimize agreement with 23 datasets of NH backbone RDCs for ubiquitin (PDB entry pending; Friedland et al. 2009). As opposed to the other ensembles, the methyl group RDCs were not used as restraints to generate the brub ensemble. The ensemble represents therefore an intermediate between 1d3z which has not been optimized to match conformational averaging seen by RDCs and 2k39 where backbone and side chain RDCs were utilized. Accordingly, the brub ensemble demonstrates an average methyl group order parameter of 0.59 that resides between the ones reported for 1d3z and 2k39 (Table 4). Interestingly, the rmsd to the RDC-derived average spherical harmonics is also reduced with respect to 1d3z but elevated when compared to 2k39.
Side chain coordinates within the brub ensemble are constructed using a rotamer library (Dunbrack and Karplus 1993). The improved agreement of RDC-derived average spherical harmonics when compared to 1d3z is therefore triggered by accurate representation of backbone conformational averaging that is propagated to the side chains. Thus, an accurate representation of backbone dynamics induces an improved but imperfect representation of side chain conformational averaging in the brub ensemble. This result supports the notion that backbone and side chain motions are coupled and therefore correlated. The accuracy of conformational averaging in side chains of the brub ensemble would beneﬁt from a rotamer selection protocol that optimizes agreement with methyl group RDCs.

Rotameric analysis: evidence for internal concerted motions

Following in the steps of (Chou and Bax 2001; Mittermaier

and Kay 2001), we address the question whether it is pos-

sible to model the mobility of side chain methyl groups

based on RDC data. The MFA can provide in principle a

detailed description of the side chain mobility with the ﬁve

independent terms contained in the average spherical har-

monics. Side chains with 2 methyl groups (Val, Ile, Leu)

contain ten unique parameters to describe the intricate

mobility occurring on a time scale faster than ms. For

individual side chains pointing inside the hydrophobic core

of the protein where motion is restricted, it would be inter-

esting to try to describe the complex side chain ﬂuctuations

and decipher internal concerted motions, i.e., correlated

rearrangements around consecutive torsion angles.

To this end, we chose several residues, for which MFA

data were available with comparatively small experimental

errors for both their methyl groups (Cc1 and Cc2 for valines, Cc2 and Cd1 for isoleucines and Cd1 and Cd2 for leucines), each acting as individual probes directly on the v1 or v2 angles. To model these side chain motions, we assume that

their mechanism is dominated by rotameric jumps and fast

libration ﬂuctuation around equilibrium positions. As

described in the Materials and Methods section, a grid

search was performed on all population factors p repre-

senting the occupancy of each of the three (Val) or nine

(Ile, Leu) possible combinations of ideal [gauche? (60°),

trans (180°), gauche- (-60°)] rotameric pairs for v1 (V, I,

L) and v2 (I, L). In addition, we include isotropic order

parameter terms, S2 and S2, to account for small scale

c

d

ﬂuctuations around each v angle. Table 4 lists the average

results for all solutions within 10% of the overall minimum

of the squared sum of difference [ssd, (9)] of the grid

search and compares them to the statistics from different

ensembles.

Figure 7 models the result of the grid search. For the

MFA-based model, we generated 200 structures satisfying

the relative rotamer populations and represented the overall

isotropic order parameter as a normal distribution of

deviations around each of the v angles. The ﬁgure gives a

sense of how the RDC-based MFA data can roughly

reproduce the same dominant rotameric conformations as

those present in the different ensembles for all types of

residues. Furthermore, the majority of missing rotamers in

the ensembles are also excluded or very rare in the results

of the grid search. This result is quite remarkable consid-

ering that the ensemble conformations are largely driven by

distance and J-coupling restraints as well as hydrophobic

packing energy during minimization, whereas the MFA

models are purely and uniquely based on orientation

restraints.

In all dynamic ensembles (1xqq, 2nr2, 2k39) as well as
in the backrub-ensemble (brub), residues I3, V5, I36, I44,
I61, and L67 have a very strong preference for a single rotameric state of v1. In contrast, the MFA results predict prevalence of the same rotamer but with substantial addi-
tional excursions into a second rotameric equilibrium position in up to 20% of the cases. These few odd rotamers
are sufﬁcient to account for part of the lowering of the S2rdc(Cc) order parameters as well as increasing their anisotropy (grdc(Cc)) (see Fig. 2). For the solvent-exposed residues L8 and V70, v1 samples more than one state in all ensembles. For V70, the same 2-state distribution (tr/g-) of v1 rotamers is reproduced by all ensembles as well as by the MFA. However, the distribution of L8 predicted from the MFA or from the EROS ensemble includes signiﬁcant
representation of all three rotamers whereas the relaxationbased ensembles include only the tr and g- rotamers. This result suggests the existence of an additional mode of motion in the supra-sc for residue L8.
Different levels of agreement are also observed in distributions of v2, when v1 is in its dominant rotameric state. Whereas the MFA rotameric predictions for I36, I44, I61, and L67 reproduce the distribution of rotamers for v2 of the ensembles, I3 adopts more frequent occurrences in the g?/g- positions than in the ensembles (38%/14% compared to \6%/0%, respectively). This distribution for I3 v2 is imposed by the very high anisotropy value for Cd1 (grdc = 0.7), not observed for other residues.

Distributions for v1 in ubiquitin have also been previously reported based on averaging of 3JNCc and 3JCCc scalar couplings by (Chou et al. 2003) and are also compared in
Table 4. In general, these are in good agreement with those
presented with the exception of I3. For this residue, the
J-couplings-based analysis predicts important populations for all three rotamers (g?/tr/g- = 0.47/0.21/0.32), in sharp
contrast to the dynamic ensembles dominated with only gauche? rotamers (g?/tr/g- = 1/0/0). The authors explain
their result by a ‘‘rotameric averaging on a time scale
slower than the rotational correlation time (4 ns)’’. Our
results for this residue rather suggest that the distribution of v1 rotamers (g?/tr/g- = 0.84/0/0.16) are only slightly modiﬁed when taking the supra-sc motions into account.
According to the motional heterogeneities predicted for
isoleucines I3, I36, I44, and I61, there is evidence for some
level of internal concerted motion along the side chain, as
the v2 distribution clearly depends on the value of v1. For example, in I3, the v2 angle has decreasing preference for rotamers in tr [ g?[ g- when v1 is in the g? state, but has a preference for rotamers in g- ) g?,tr when v1 is g-. In I61, the v2 has decreasing preference for rotamers in tr [ g- [ g? when v1 is in the g- state, but has a preference for g?[g- [ tr when v1 is g?. As appreciated from Fig. 7, these combinations of v angles indicate that I3
adopts a more narrow and elongated conformation whereas
I61 is wider and shorter. Similar correlations between v
angles can be made for I36 and I44.

state of v2 requires compensation by a concerted jump from one rotamer state to another for v1.

Summary

Fig. 7 Eight representative examples of methyl bearing ubiquitin side chain heterogeneity from average structure (pdb:1d3z), from backrub-ensemble (brub), from dynamic ensembles (pdb:1xqq, 2nr2, 2k39) and from ensembles generated by rotamer model-ﬁtting of the average spherical harmonics resulting from the Model-free Analysis (MFA). Backbone is shown in black, Cb–Cc1 (Cb–Cc2), Cc–Cd (Cb–Cc2) and Cc–Cd1 (Cc–Cd2) bonds are in red (green) for valines, isoleucines, and leucines, respectively. In the MFA rotamer construction of leucines, the small scale ﬂuctuation order parameter is entirely represented in v2. Side chains are aligned based on N, Ca,Cb and C0 positions
Evidence for concerted motions is also strong for the two leucines, L8 and L67. While we do not probe directly the motion around the Ca–Cb torsional angle from methyl group RDCs, this angle is still reﬂected in both of the d-methyl groups. From the minimum search, we ﬁnd that, in L8 where all three v1 rotamers are present, v2 prefers being in the g? and g- positions when v1 is in g? (populations: 0.54 and 0.44) or tr (populations: 0.41 and 0.57), but prefers being in tr when v1 is in g- (population: 0.66). Similarly in L67, three different distributions of tr, g? and g- rotamers of v2 are observed depending on the state of v1.
The results of the rotamer analysis indicate that side chains may adopt more than one conformation. Based on a number of residues both solvent and core exposed, there is important evidence for internal correlated concerted motion. This may well be due to the fact that the rather tight packing restriction only allow for certain side chain conformations and therefore the switch from one rotamer

We have used RDCs to detect methyl group motion faster than ms with special focus on the supra-sc window (ns to ls) in ubiquitin. A very wide range of motional amplitudes exist in side chains depending on solvent exposure, residue type and distance to the backbone. Considerable additional dynamics slower than the correlation time sc has been detected. On average, the amplitude of motion expressed in terms of order parameters associated with the supra-sc window contributes as much mobility as the ps-ns motion of the methyl groups measured from relaxation data. The RDC-based order parameters covering motion up to ms and the relaxation derived order parameter show a correlation coefﬁcient of r = 0.72, suggesting that a fair portion of the additional mobility in the supra-sc region can be interpreted mostly as a ‘‘broadening’’ of the amplitude of motion. Amplitude-wise, we ﬁnd a good match with the order parameters derived from solid-state measurements of CH dipolar couplings (Lorieau and McDermott 2006) and an even better match with those derived from a combined J-coupling and residual dipolar coupling approach (Chou et al. 2003) and supplemented with the fast motions from the backbone.
The model-free order parameters deviate quite signiﬁcantly from those back-calculated from existing dynamic ensembles, probably due to the limited number of ensemble members. Still, the EROS ensemble, which was reﬁned against the methyl group RDCs also used for this study, agrees best with the model-free order parameters. However, it will be necessary to generate better ensembles to faithfully reﬂect the side chain dynamics.
A rotameric analysis was performed on several amino acid side chains for which RDC-derived average spherical harmonics of two methyl groups were available. The resulting rotamer distributions were in agreement with conformations representing correlated motions about adjacent torsional angles rather than with a random collection of conformations. While such correlations of rotamer jumps in side chains are not unexpected, especially in the hydrophobic core and are regularly seen for example in phospholipid membranes (Schindler and Seelig 1975; Seelig 1977), there has been weak experimental evidence so far for such correlated motions in proteins.
The development of new sophisticated methods both in NMR and molecular dynamics will be necessary to unravel the complex behavior of side chain motions and their implication in enzyme recognition and protein folding.
