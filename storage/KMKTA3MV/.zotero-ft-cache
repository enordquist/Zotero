Abstract
We analyze critically the use of classi cation accuracy to compare classi ers on natural data sets, providing a thorough investigation using ROC analysis, standard machine learning algorithms, and standard benchmark data sets. The results raise serious concerns about the use of accuracy for comparing classi ers and draw into question the conclusions that can be drawn from such studies. In the course of the presentation, we describe and demonstrate what we believe to be the proper use of ROC analysis for comparative studies in machine learning research. We argue that this methodology is preferable both for making practical choices and for drawing scienti c conclusions.
1 INTRODUCTION
Substantial research has been devoted to the development and analysis of algorithms for building classi ers, and a necessary part of this research involves comparing induction algorithms. A common methodology for such evaluations is to perform statistical comparisons of the accuracies of learned classi ers on suites of benchmark data sets. Our purpose is not to question the statistical tests Dietterich, 1998; Salzberg, 1997, but to question the use of accuracy estimation itself. We believe that since this is one of the primary scienti c methodologies of our eld, it is important that we as a scienti c community cast a critical eye upon it. The two most reasonable justi cations for comparing accuracies on natural data sets require empirical veri cation. We argue that a particular form of ROC

analysis is the proper methodology to provide such veri cation. We then provide a thorough analysis of classi er performance using standard machine learning algorithms and standard benchmark data sets. The results raise serious concerns about the use of accuracy, both for practical comparisons and for drawing scienti c conclusions, even when predictive performance is the only concern. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. We analyze critically a common assumption of machine learning research, provide insights into its applicability, and discuss the implications. In the process, we describe what we believe to be a superior methodology for the evaluation of induction algorithms on natural data sets. Although ROC analysis certainly is not new, for machine learning research it should be applied in a principled manner geared to the speci c conclusions machine learning researchers would like to draw. We hope that this work makes signi cant progress toward that goal.
2 JCUOSMTPIFAYRIINSGONASCCURACY
We consider induction problems for which the intent in applying machine learning algorithms is to build from the existing data a model a classi er that will be used to classify previously unseen examples. We limit ourselves to predictive performance|which is clearly the intent of most accuracy-based machine learning studies|and do not consider issues such as comprehensibility and computational performance. We assume that the true distribution of examples to which the classi er will be applied is not known in advance. To make an informed choice, performance must be estimated using the data available. The di erent methodologies for arriving at these estimations have been described elsewhere Kohavi, 1995;

Dietterich, 1998. By far, the most commonly used performance metric is classi cation accuracy. Why should we care about comparisons of accuracies on benchmark data sets? Theoretically, over the universe of induction algorithms no algorithm will be superior on all possible induction problems Wolpert, 1994; Scha er, 1994. The tacit reason for comparing classi ers on natural data sets is that these data sets represent problems that systems might face in the real world, and that superior performance on these benchmarks may translate to superior performance on other real-world tasks. To this end, the eld has amassed an admirable collection of data sets from a wide variety of classi er applications Merz and Murphy, 1998. Countless research results have been published based on comparisons of classi er accuracy over these benchmark data sets. We argue that comparing accuracies on our benchmark data sets says little, if anything, about classi er performance on real-world tasks. Accuracy maximization is not an appropriate goal for many of the real-world tasks from which our natural data sets were taken. Classi cation accuracy assumes equal misclassi cation costs for false positive and false negative errors. This assumption is problematic, because for most real-world problems one type of classi cation error is much more expensive than another. This fact is well documented, primarily in other elds statistics, medical diagnosis, pattern recognition and decision theory. As an example, consider machine learning for fraud detection, where the cost of missing a case of fraud is quite di erent from the cost of a false alarm Fawcett and Provost, 1997. Accuracy maximization also assumes that the class distribution class priors is known for the target environment. Unfortunately, for our benchmark data sets, we often do not know whether the existing distribution is the natural distribution, or whether it has been strati ed. The iris data set has exactly 50 instances of each class. The splice junction data set DNA has 50 donor sites, 25 acceptor sites and 25 nonboundary sites, even though the natural class distribution is very skewed: no more than 6 of DNA actually codes for human genes Saitta and Neri, 1998. Without knowledge of the target class distribution we cannot even claim that we are indeed maximizing accuracy for the problem from which the data set was drawn. If accuracy maximization is not appropriate, why would we use accuracy estimates to compare induction algorithms on these data sets? Here are what we

believe to be the two best candidate justi cations.
1. The classi er with the highest accuracy may very well be the classi er that minimizes cost, particularly when the classi er's tradeo between true positive predictions and false positives can be tuned. Consider a learned model that produces probability estimates; these can be combined with prior probabilities and cost estimates for decisionanalytic classi cations. If the model has high classi cation accuracy because it produces very good probability estimates, it will also have low cost for any target scenario.
2. The induction algorithm that produces the highest accuracy classi ers may also produce minimum-cost classi ers by training it di erently. For example, Breiman et al. 1984 suggest that altering the class distribution will be e ective for building cost-sensitive decision trees see also other work on cost-sensitive classi cation Turney, 1996.
To criticize the practice of comparing machine learning algorithms based on accuracy, it is not su cient merely to point out that accuracy is not the metric by which real-world performance will be measured. Instead, it is necessary to analyze whether these candidate justi cations are well founded.
3 ARERAESTOHNEASBELJEU?STIFICATIONS
We rst discuss a commonly cited special case of the second justi cation, arguing that it makes too many untenable assumptions. We then present the results of an empirical study that leads us to conclude that these justi cations are questionable at best.
3.1 CAN WE DEFINE AWAY THE PROBLEM?
In principle, for a two-class problem one can reproportion  stratify" the classes based on the target costs and class distribution. Once this has been done, maximizing accuracy on the transformed data corresponds to minimizing costs on the target data Breiman et al., 1984. Unfortunately, this strategy is impracticable for conducting empirical research based on our benchmark data sets. First, the transformation is valid only for two-class problems. Whether it can be approximated e ectively for multiclass problems is an open question.

Second, we do not know appropriate costs for these data sets and, as noted by many applied researchers Bradley, 1997; Catlett, 1995; Provost and Fawcett, 1997, assigning these costs precisely is virtually impossible. Third, as described above, generally we do not know whether the class distribution in a natural data set is the true" target class distribution. Because of these uncertainties we cannot claim to be able to transform these cost-minimization problems into accuracy-maximization problems. Moreover, in many cases specifying target conditions is not just virtually impossible, it is actually impossible. Often in real-world domains there are no true" target costs and class distribution. These change from time to time, place to place, and situation to situation Fawcett and Provost, 1997. Therefore the ability to transform cost minimization into accuracy maximization does not, by itself, justify limiting our comparisons to classi cation accuracy on the given class distribution. However, it may be that comparisons based on classi cation accuracy are useful because they are indicative of a broader notion of better" performance.
3.2 MROOCDEALNSALYSIS AND DOMINATING
We now investigate whether an algorithm that generates high-accuracy classi ers is generally better because it also produces low-cost classi ers for the target cost scenario. Without target cost and class distribution information, in order to conclude that the classi er with higher accuracy is the better classi er, one must show that it performs better for any reasonable assumptions. We limit our investigation to two-class problems because the analysis is straightforward. The evaluation framework we choose is Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC analysis, a classic methodology from signal detection theory that is now common in medical diagnosis and has recently begun to be used more generally in AI Swets, 1988; Provost and Fawcett, 1997. We brie y review some of the basics of ROC analysis. ROC space denotes the coordinate system used for visualizing classi er performance. In ROC space, typically the true positive rate, T P , is plotted on the Y axis and the false positive rate, F P , is plotted on the X axis. Each classi er is represented by the point in ROC space corresponding to its F P; T P  pair. For models that produce a continuous output e.g., an estimate of the posterior probability of an instance's class mem-

bership, these statistics vary together as a threshold on the output is varied between its extremes, with each threshold value de ning a classi er. The resulting curve, called the ROC curve, illustrates the error tradeo s available with a given model. ROC curves describe the predictive behavior of a classi er independent of class distributions or error costs, so they decouple classi cation performance from these factors. For our purposes, a crucial notion is whether one model dominates in ROC space, meaning that all other ROC curves are beneath it or equal to it. A dominating model e.g., model NB in Figure 1a is at least as good as all other models for all possible cost and class distributions. Therefore, if a dominating model exists, it can be considered to be the best" model in terms of predictive performance. If a dominating model does not exist as in Figure 1b, then none of the models represented is best under all target scenarios; in such cases, there exist scenarios for which the model that maximizes accuracy or any other single-number metric does not have minimum cost. Figure 1 shows test-set ROC curves on two of the UCI domains from the study described below. Note the bumpiness" of the ROC curves in Figure 1b these were two of the largest domains with the least bumpy ROC curves. This bumpiness is typical of induction studies using ROC curves generated from a hold-out test set. As with accuracy estimates based on a single hold-out set, these ROC curves may be misleading because we cannot tell how much of the observed variation is due to the particular training test partition. Thus it is di cult to draw strong conclusions about the expected behavior of the learned models. We would like to conduct ROC analysis using cross-validation. Bradley 1997 produced ROC curves from 10-fold cross validation, but they are similarly bumpy. Bradley generated the curves using a technique known as pooling. In pooling, the ith points making up each raw ROC curve are averaged. Unfortunately, as discussed by Swets and Pickett 1982, pooling assumes that the ith points from all the curves are actually estimating the same point in ROC space, which is doubtful given Bradley's method of generating curves.1 For our study it is important to have a good approximation of the expected ROC curve. We generate results from 10-fold cross-validation using a di erent methodology, called averaging. Rather than using the averaging procedure recommended by Swets
1Bradley acknowledges this fact, and it is not germane to his study. However, it is problematic for us.

3.3 DO STANDARD METHODS PRODUCE DOMINATING MODELS?
We can now state precisely a basic hypothesis to be investigated: Our standard learning algorithms produce dominating models for our standard benchmark data sets. If this hypothesis is true generally, we might conclude that the algorithm with higher accuracy is generally better, regardless of target costs or priors.3
2Note that classi cation performance anywhere along a line segment connecting two ROC points can be achieved by randomly selecting classi cations weighted by the interpolation proportion from the classi ers de ning the endpoints.
3However, even this conclusion has problems. Accuracy comparisons may select a non-dominating classi er because it is indistinguishable at the point of comparison|yet it may be much worse elsewhere.

If the hypothesis is not true, then such a conclusion will have to rely on a di erent justi cation. We now provide an experimental study of this hypothesis, designed as follows. From the UCI repository we chose ten datasets that contained at least 250 instances, but for which the accuracy for decision trees was less than 95 because the ROC curves are di cult to read at very high accuracies. For each domain, we induced classi ers for the minority class for Road we chose the class Grass. We selected several inducers from MLC++ Kohavi et al., 1997: a decision tree learner MC4, Naive Bayes with discretization NB, k-nearest neighbor for several k values IBk, and Bagged-MC4 Breiman, 1996. MC4 is similar to C4.5 Quinlan, 1993; probabilistic predictions are made by using a Laplace correction at the leaves. NB discretizes the data based on entropy minimization Dougherty et al., 1995 and then builds the Naive-Bayes model Domingos and Pazzani, 1997. IBk votes the closest k neighbors; each neighbor votes with a weight equal to one over its distance from the test instance. The averaged ROC curves are shown in Figures 2 and 3. For only one Vehicle of these ten domains was there an absolute dominator. In general, very few of the 100 runs we performed 10 data sets, 10 crossvalidation folds each had dominating classi ers. Some cases are very close, for example Adult and Waveform21. In other cases a curve that dominates in one area of ROC space is dominated in another. Therefore, we can refute the hypothesis that our algorithms produce

statistically signi cantly dominating classi ers. This draws into question claims of algorithm A is better than algorithm B" based on accuracy comparison. In order to draw such a conclusion in the absence of target costs and class distributions, the ROC curve for algorithm A would have to be a signi cant dominator of algorithm B. This has obvious implications for machine learning research. In practical situations, often a weaker claim is su cient: Algorithm A is a good choice because it is at least as good as Algorithm B i.e., their accuracies are not signi cantly di erent. It is clear that this type of conclusion also is not justi ed. In many domains, curves that are statistically indistinguishable from dominators in one area of the space are signi -

cantly dominated in another. Moreover, in practical situations typically comparisons are not made with the wealth of classi ers we are considering. More often only a few classi ers are compared. Considering general pairwise comparisons of algorithms, there are many cases where each model in a pair is clearly much better than the other in di erent regions of ROC space. This clearly draws into question the use of single number metrics for practical algorithm comparison, unless these metrics are based on precise target cost and class distribution information.

3.4 CAN STANDARD METHODS BE COERCED TO YIELD DOMINATING ROC CURVES?
The second justi cation for using accuracy to compare algorithms is subtly di erent from the rst. Speci cally, it allows for the possibility of coercing algorithms to produce di erent behaviors under di erent scenarios such as in cost-sensitive learning. If this can be done well, accuracy comparisons are justi ed by arguing that for a given domain, the algorithm with higher accuracy will also be the algorithm with lower cost for all reasonable costs and class distributions. Con rming or refuting this justi cation completely is beyond the scope of this paper, because how best to coerce algorithms for di erent environmental conditions is an open question. Even the straightforward method of stratifying samples has not been evaluated satisfactorily. We argue that the ROC framework outlined so far, with a minor modi cation, can be used to evaluate this question as well. We then o er some discon rming evidence. For algorithms that may produce di erent models under di erent cost and class distributions, the ROC methodology as stated above is not quite adequate. We must be able to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, not an individual model. However, one can characterize an algorithm's performance for ROC analysis by producing a composite curve for a set of generated models. This can be done using pooling, or by using the convex hull of the ROC curves produced by the set of models, as described in detail by Provost and Fawcett 1997; 1998. We can now form a hypothesis for our second potential justi cation: Our standard learning algorithms produce dominating ROC curves for our standard benchmark data sets. Con rming this hypothesis would be an important step in justifying the common practice of ignoring target costs and class distributions in class er comparisons on natural data. Unfortunately, we know of no con rming evidence. On the other hand, there is discon rming evidence. First, consider the results presented above. Naive Bayes is robust with respect to changes in costs|it will produce the same ROC curve regardless of the target costs and class distribution. Furthermore, it has been shown that decision trees are surprisingly robust if the probability estimates are generated with the Laplace estimate Bradford et al., 1998. If this result holds generally, the results in the previous section would discon rm the present hypothesis as well.

Second, Bradley's 1997 results provide discon rming evidence. Speci cally, he studied six real-world medical data sets four from the UCI repository and two from other sources. Bradley plotted the ROC curves of six classi er learning algorithms, consisting of two neural nets, two decision trees and two statistical techniques. Bradley uses composite ROC curves formed by training models di erently for di erent cost distributions. We have previously criticized the design of his study for the purpose of answering our question. However, if the results can be replicated under the current methodology, they would make a strong statement. Not one of the six data sets had a dominating classi er. This implies that for each domain there exist disjoint sets of conditions for which di erent induction algorithms are preferable.
4 RLIEMCIOTMATMIOENNSDATIONS AND
When designing comparative studies, researchers should be clear about the conclusions they want to be able to draw from the results. We have argued that comparisons of algorithms based on accuracy are unsatisfactory when there is no dominating classi er. However, presenting the case against the use of accuracy is only one of our goals. We also want to show how precise comparisons still can be made, even when the target cost and class distributions are not known. If there is no dominator, conclusions must be qualied. No single number metric can be used to make very strong conclusions without domain-speci c information. However, it is possible to look at ranges of costs and class distributions for which each classi er dominates. The problems of cost-sensitive classi cation and learning with skewed class distributions can be analyzed precisely. Even without knowledge of target conditions, a precise, concise, robust speci cation of classi er performance can be made. As described in detail by Provost and Fawcett 1997, the slopes of the lines tangent to the ROC convex hull determine the ranges of costs and class distributions for which particular classi ers minimize cost. For speci c target conditions, the corresponding slope is the cost ratio times the reciprocal of the class ratio. For our ten domains, the optimal classi ers for di erent target conditions are given in Table 1. For example, in the Road domain see Figure 3 and Table 1, Naive Bayes is the best classi er for any target conditions corresponding to a slope less than 0:38, and Bagged-MC4 is best for slopes greater

than 0:38. They perform equally well at 0:38. We admit that this is not as elegant as a single-number comparison, but we believe it to be much more useful, both for research and in practice. In summary, if a dominating classi er does not exist and cost and class distribution information is unavailable, no strong statement about classi er superiority can be made. However, one might be able to make precise statements of superiority for speci c regions of ROC space. For example, if all you know is that few false positive errors can be tolerated, you may be able to nd a particular algorithm that is superior at the far left" edge of ROC space. We limited our investigation to two classes. This does not a ect our conclusions since our results are negative. However, since we are also recommending an analytical framework, we note that extending our work to multiple dimensions is an interesting open problem. Finally, we are not completely satis ed with our method of generating con dence intervals. The present intervals are appropriate for the NeymanPearson observer Egan, 1975, which wants to maximize TP for a given FP. However, their appropriateness is questionable for evaluating minimum expected cost, for which a given set of costs contours ROC space with lines of a particular slope. Although this is an area of future work, it is not a fundamental drawback to the methodology.

5 CONCLUSIONS
We have o ered for debate the justi cation for the use of accuracy estimation as the primary metric for comparing algorithms on our benchmark data sets. We have elucidated what we believe to be the top candidates for such a justi cation, and have shown that either they are not realistic because we cannot specify cost and class distributions precisely, or they are not supported by experimental evidence. We draw two conclusions from this work. First, the justi cations for using accuracy to compare classi ers are questionable at best. Second, we have described what we believe to be the proper use of ROC analysis as applied to comparative studies in machine learning research. ROC analysis is not as simple as comparing with a single-number metric. However, we believe that the additional power it delivers is well worth the e ort. In certain situations, ROC analysis allows very strong, general conclusions to be made|both positive and negative. In situations where strong, general conclusions can not be made, ROC analysis allows very precise analysis to be conducted. Although ROC analysis is not new, in machine learning research it has not been applied in a principled manner, geared to the speci c conclusions machine learning researchers would like to draw. We hope that this work makes signi cant progress toward that goal.
