Efﬁcient folding of many newly synthesized proteins depends on assistance from molecular chaperones, which serve to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation in the crowded environment of the cell. Nascent chain– binding chaperones, including trigger factor, Hsp70, and prefoldin, stabilize elongating chains on ribosomes in a nonaggregated state. Folding in the cytosol is achieved either on controlled chain release from these factors or after transfer of newly synthesized proteins to downstream chaperones, such as the chaperonins. These are large, cylindrical complexes that provide a central compartment for a single protein chain to fold unimpaired by aggregation. Understanding how the thousands of different proteins synthesized in a cell use this chaperone machinery has profound implications for biotechnology and medicine.

ing (1, 6). This aggregation process irreversibly removes proteins from their productive folding pathways, and must be prevented in vivo by molecular chaperones. A certain level of protein aggregation does occur in cells despite the presence of an exclusive chaperone machinery and, in special cases, can lead to the formation of structured, fibrillar aggregates, known as amyloid, that are associated with diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Huntington’s disease (6, 7) (Fig. 1).

Macromolecular crowding. The excluded volume effects resulting from the highly crowded nature of the cytosol (300 to 400 g/liter of proteins and other macromolecules in Escherichia coli) (9) are predicted to enhance the aggregation of nonnative protein chains substantially by increasing their effective concentrations (10) (Fig. 1). Crowding generally provides a nonspecific force for macromolecular compaction and association (11), including the collapse of protein chains during folding (9) and the interaction of nonnative proteins with molecular chaperones (12).

Nascent chains probably interact generally with TF, and most small proteins (ϳ65 to 80% of total) fold rapidly upon synthesis without further assistance. Longer chains (10 to 20% of total) interact subsequently with DnaK and DnaJ and fold upon one or several cycles of ATP-dependent binding and release. About 10 to 15% of chains transit the chaperonin system—GroEL and GroES—for folding. GroEL does not bind to nascent chains and is thus likely to receive an appreciable fraction of its substrates after their interaction with DnaK. (B) Archaea.

Like TF, NAC probably interacts generally with nascent chains. The majority of small chains may fold upon ribosome release without further assistance.

Ribosome-Binding Chaperones
Trigger factor (TF), a eubacterial protein of 48 kD, binds to ribosomes at a 1:1 stochiometry and interacts with nascent chains as short as 57 residues (27). The nascent chain–TF complex dissociates, in an ATP-independent manner, after chain release from the ribosome (27). Although TF exhibits peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity in vitro, recognition of target polypeptides by TF is independent of proline residues (28) and is mediated by short sequences enriched in hydrophobic (aromatic) amino acids (28). TF has an overlapping chaperone function with the main bacterial Hsp70 system, DnaK and DnaJ, in stabilizing nascent chains in a state competent for subsequent folding (20, 21). E. coli cells lacking TF (⌬tig) or DnaK (⌬dnak) exhibit no apparent folding defects at 37°C; however, deletion of dnaK in a ⌬tig strain is lethal. In light of this functional redundancy, the biological significance of the PPIase activity of TF remained unclear, but a recent study suggests that DnaK has a related activity in accelerating the cis/trans isomerization of nonprolyl peptide bonds (29). These isomerase activities may allow TF and the Hsp70s to maintain nascent and newly synthesized chains in a flexible state, poised for rapid folding upon release. In contrast to DnaK, a role of TF in mediating folding posttranslationally has not yet been demonstrated, but would be consistent with the finding that only half of total TF is ribosome bound (30)
The eukaryotic cytosol lacks TF but contains a ribosome-associated heterodimeric complex of ␣ (33 kD) and ␤ (22 kD) subunits, termed NAC (nascent chain–associated complex) (Fig. 2C) (31). A homolog of ␣-NAC appears to be present in some archaea (32). Although NAC lacks a PPIase domain, it has properties that suggest a functional similarity to TF. NAC associates with short nascent chains and dissociates upon chain

release from the ribosome (4, 33). However, a direct role for NAC in protein folding remains to be established.
Whereas the Hsp70 proteins in bacteria and higher eukaryotes act both co- and posttranslationally (see below), yeast and other fungi have cytosolic Hsp70 homologs that are specialized in nascent chain binding. The Ssb1 and Ssb2 proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae interact with the ribosome and with short nascent chains (34). Interestingly, this function of the Ssb proteins appears to be mediated by yet another Hsp70, Ssz1, which forms a stable ribosome-associated complex (RAC) with zuotin (35, 36), the Hsp40 partner of Ssb1 and Ssb2 (30). RAC and the Ssb proteins are thought to act in concert in stabilizing nascent chains.
The Hsp70 System The classic, nonribosome-binding members of the Hsp70 family exist in the cytosol of eubacteria, eukarya, and some archaea, as well as within eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. S. cerevisiae has four nonribosome-binding Hsp70 proteins in the cytosol, namely, Ssa1 to Ssa4. The cytosol of higher eukaryotes contains both constitutively expressed Hsp70 homologs (Hsc70) and stress-inducible forms (Hsp70). Together with cochaperones of the Hsp40 (DnaJ) family, these Hsp70s function by binding and releasing, in an

ATP-dependent manner, extended polypeptide segments that are exposed by proteins in their non-native states.
Structure and reaction cycle. The structural and mechanistic aspects of the Hsp70 system are best understood for the eubacterial Hsp70, termed DnaK, its Hsp40 cochaperone, DnaJ, and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE. DnaK consists of a ϳ44-kD NH2terminal ATPase domain and a ϳ27-kD COOH-terminal peptide-binding domain (37) (Fig. 3A). The latter is divided into a ␤-sandwhich subdomain with a peptidebinding cleft and an ␣-helical latchlike segment (38). Target peptides are ϳseven residues long and are typically hydrophobic in their central region, with leucine and isoleucine residues being preferred by DnaK (4, 39) (Fig. 3A). These binding sites occur statistically every ϳ40 residues in proteins and are recognized with affinities of 5 nM to 5 ␮M (37). The peptides are bound to DnaK in an extended state through hydrophobic sidechain interactions and hydrogen bonds with

the peptide backbone (38). Thus, Hsp70 recognizes structural features common to most nascent chains: exposed hydrophobic amino acid side chains, in conjunction with an accessible polypeptide backbone.
Rapid peptide binding occurs in the ATPbound state of DnaK in which the ␣-helical latch over the peptide-binding cleft is in an open conformation (Fig. 3B). Stable holding of peptide involves closing of the latch, a conformational change that is achieved by hydrolysis of bound ATP to adenosine 5Јdiphosphate (ADP). The cycling of DnaK between these states is regulated by DnaJ (41 kD) and by GrpE, a homodimer of 20-kD subunits (37, 40). The NH2-terminal J domain of DnaJ binds to DnaK and accelerates hydrolysis of ATP by DnaK, thus facilitating peptide capture (41, 42). The COOH-terminal domain of DnaJ (and of other Hsp40s) functions as a chaperone in recognizing hydrophobic peptides and can thus recruit DnaK to nascent chains (15, 43, 44). GrpE induces the release of ADP from DnaK (40), and upon rebinding of ATP the DnaK-peptide complex dissociates, completing the reaction cycle (Fig. 3B).
Some eukaryotic Hsp70 homologs, such as BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum, cooperate with J-domain proteins that lack a separate affinity for hydrophobic sequences. These Hsp70s may be able to bind extended polypeptide chains more generally, independent of exposed hydrophobic features (45). Whereas all Hsp70s seem to cooperate with J proteins, most eukaryotic Hsp70 proteins may be independent, for their general function, of a GrpE-like nucleotide exchange factor. Such a factor appears to be dispensable because the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle of eukaryotic Hsp70 is normally not the dissociation of bound ADP, but ATP hydrolysis itself. On the other hand, a small protein, Bag-1, acts as a nucleotide exchange factor and specific regulator of Hsp70 in the eukaryotic cytosol (46). The Hsp70-interacting Bag domain is structurally unrelated to GrpE (40, 47 ) and in Bag-1 is linked to an NH2-terminal ubiquitin-homology domain (see below).
Substrates and mechanism of folding. The cellular concentration of DnaK (ϳ50 ␮M) exceeds that of ribosomes (ϳ30 ␮M) (4), assuming an even cytosolic distribution. DnaK preferentially associates with elongating polypeptides larger than 20 to 30 kD and thus acts on nascent chains subsequent to TF (21) (Fig. 2A). Upon deletion of TF, the fraction of nascent and newly synthesized polypeptides interacting with DnaK increases from ϳ15 to ϳ40% (20, 21). Whereas some chains transit DnaK with half-lives of less than 1 min, consistent with rapid folding upon completion of synthesis, other newly synthesized proteins are released from DnaK slowly, with half-lives of 10 min or more.

SCIENCE’S COMPASS
Large proteins Ͼ60 kD, which do not fit into the central cavity of the chaperonin GroEL (see below), constitute an appreciable fraction of these substrates, suggesting that DnaK facilitates the posttranslational folding of multidomain proteins through cycles of binding and release (21). Consistent with this conclusion, depletion of DnaK in TF-deleted cells causes the aggregation of many large, newly synthesized polypeptides (20). Similar to DnaK, mammalian Hsc70 also binds a wide range of nascent and newly synthesized chains (Ͼ15 to 20% of total) (Fig. 2C), including many multidomain proteins Ͼ50 kD (22).
How do cycles of Hsp70 binding and release promote protein folding? Generally, on release from Hsp70, an unfolded chain is free to partition to its native state. Rebinding of slow-folding intermediates to Hsp70 follows this release and prevents aggregation. Assuming that for long protein chains cycling is mediated by multiple Hsp70 molecules at the level of individual domains, the Hsp70 system could promote the folding of multidomain proteins by preventing (and perhaps reversing) intramolecular misfolding. The recently discovered isomerase activity of Hsp70 for nonprolyl peptide bonds may support this function (29). Consistent with this model, the Hsp70 system strongly accelerates the slow, spontaneous refolding of chemically denatured firefly luciferase (ϳ60 kD) in vitro (48, 49). The enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase accumulates in a misfolded but soluble form in vivo when expressed in Hsp70 (Ssa)deficient yeast (50).
Surprisingly, the components of the Hsp70 system are missing in certain species of archaea (32). How these cells protect nascent and newly synthesized polypeptides from aggregating is not yet clear, but a candidate chaperone for nascent chains in archaea is prefoldin.
Prefoldin
Prefoldin (PFD) (51), also known as the Gim complex (genes involved in microtubule biogenesis) (52), is a ϳ90-kD complex of two ␣ and four ␤ subunits in the archaeal and eukaryotic cytosol. The eukaryotic ␣ and ␤ subunits are not identical but orthologous (53). The structure of PFD resembles that of a jellyfish, with six ␣-helical coiled-coil tentacles emanating from a ␤-barrel body (Fig. 3C). At the tips these ϳ65 Å long coiled coils are partially unwound, exposing hydrophobic amino acid residues for the binding of nonnative protein (54) (Fig. 3C). Substrate binding and release by PFD is ATP independent, and in vitro, mammalian and archaeal PFD can stabilize nonnative proteins for subsequent transfer to a chaperonin (51, 53). PFD binds to nascent chains (55, 56 ) and cooperates in the folding of actin and

tubulin with the eukaryotic chaperonin (17). Interestingly, a combined deletion of the Ssb-class Hsp70s and of PFD in yeast results in a pronounced synthetic growth defect (56), resembling the synthetically lethal phenotype of the TF and DnaK deletions in E. coli (20, 21). These findings underscore the functional redundancy among nascent chain– binding chaperones and suggest that PFD may have a DnaK or TF-like role in the archaeal cytosol.
The Chaperonins
The chaperonins are a conserved class of large double-ring complexes of ϳ800 kD enclosing a central cavity. They occur in two subgroups that are similar in architecture but distantly related in sequence. Group I chaperonins, also known as Hsp60s, are generally found only in eubacteria and in organelles of endosymbiotic origin—mitochondria and chloroplasts. They cooperate with cofactors of the GroES or Hsp10 family. Group II chaperonins exist in the archaeal and the eukaryotic cytosol and are GroES independent. The chaperonin mechanism differs fundamentally from that of the Hsp70 system, although in both cases protein binding and release is ATP regulated. Nonnative substrate protein is first captured through hydrophobic contacts with multiple chaperonin subunits and is then displaced into the central ring cavity where it folds, protected from aggregating with other nonnative proteins.
Group I chaperonins—structure and reaction cycle. E. coli GroEL and its cofactor GroES represent the paradigmatic Group I chaperonin system. In GroEL, two heptameric rings of identical 57-kD subunits are stacked back-to-back. Each subunit consists of three domains: The equatorial domain harbors the ATP binding site and is connected through an intermediate, hingelike domain to the apical domain (Fig. 4A). The latter makes up the opening of the cylinder and exposes a number of hydrophobic residues toward the ring cavity for substrate binding. GroES is a homoheptameric ring of ϳ10-kD subunits that cycles on and off the ends of the GroEL cylinder, in a manner regulated by the GroEL ATPase (4, 37, 57) (Fig. 4A).
The hydrophobic surfaces exposed by the apical domains (Fig. 4A) interact with hydrophobic amino acid residues on compact folding intermediates (4, 37, 57). Hydrophobic sequences bind to a flexible groove between two amphiphilic helices in the apical domain. This region can accommodate a peptide either as a ␤ hairpin or an amphiphilic ␣-helical conformation (58, 59). Stable substrate binding with nanomolar affinity relies on the interaction of a nonnative polypeptide with multiple apical domains (60). The GroES subunits have mobile sequence loops that contact the substrate-binding regions in the apical domains of GroEL and

Upon completion of hydrolysis, binding of seven ATP molecules to the trans ring triggers the opening of the cage. Both folded and nonnative protein exit at this point (Fig.

with, and assists in the folding of, certain proteins too large to be encapsulated by GroES (23, 24, 71). Mitochondrial aconitase (82 kD), for example, can fold through ATPregulated cycles of GroEL binding and release of nonnative states, with protein release being triggered by the binding of GroES to the opposite (trans) ring of GroEL (71).
Group II chaperonins. The Group II chaperonin of the eukaryotic cytosol, TRiC (TCP-1 ring complex, also called CCT for chaperonin-containing TCP-1), contains eight orthologous subunits per ring that differ primarily in their apical domains. The simpler archaeal chaperonin, referred to as thermosome, consists of up to three different subunits, which are arranged in eight- or nine-membered rings. The backbone trace of the chaperonin II apical domain is virtually identical to that of GroEL, with the exception of an ␣-helical insertion that protrudes from the ring opening (72, 73) and, in the absence of a separate GroES-like cofactor, is thought to function as a built-in lid of the central cavity.
The mechanism of Group II chaperonins is not yet well understood, and the nature and exact location of the substrate binding site(s) on the apical domains are still undefined. The most abundant substrates of TRiC are the cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin. Strikingly, folding of these proteins cannot be mediated by GroEL and GroES, suggesting a more specific role for TRiC in folding beyond prevention of aggregation. Actin binds to TRiC through at least two distinct regions and interacts with specific TRiC subunits (74, 75). ATP binding induces encapsulation of the protein by the apical-domain protrusions and initiates folding (75, 76). Through its built-in lid mechanism, TRiC may act cotranslationally in the folding of discrete domains of proteins that are too large to be encapsulated as a whole (16) (Fig. 2C).
The subunit heterogeneity of TRiC suggested that the cytosolic chaperonin may be adapted to assisting the folding of a small set of specific proteins, including actins and tubulins. However, as determined by a recent pulse-chase analysis in mammalian cells, TRiC interacts transiently with a wider range of newly synthesized proteins of 30 to 120 kD in size, constituting ϳ12% of total synthesized chains (22). The list of model substrates includes, among others, firefly luciferase, ␣-transducin, and the von Hippel– Lindau tumor suppressor protein (5).
Coordination of Translation and Chaperone Activities
To ensure an efficient use of the cytosolic folding machinery, protein synthesis on ribosomes must be coordinated with the activities of the various chaperone systems in stabilizing nascent chains and in promoting folding.

SCIENCE’S COMPASS
The mechanistic principles underlying this functional cooperation are not yet well understood, but plausible models have been developed based on a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies.
Cotranslational domain folding. It has been suggested that translation itself can have a “chaperone-like” role in the folding of larger proteins composed of multiple domains (77). Attempts to refold such proteins in vitro often result in intramolecular misfolding and aggregation (5). Cotranslational and sequential domain folding, i.e., the folding of one domain well before another is synthesized, avoids this problem, as demonstrated with artificial two-domain fusion proteins combining the ϳ20-kD proteins H-ras and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (77).
Domain folding during translation occurs in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytosol (78), but a difference in the efficiencies of folding was noted for certain multidomain proteins when comparing both systems (77). The bacterial two-domain protein OmpR and the ras-DHFR fusion proteins fold cotranslationally in a mammalian cell lysate or in intact cells but posttranslationally upon synthesis in the E. coli system. Although the individual domains fold efficiently in E. coli, bacterial expression of ras-DHFR does not result in an active protein. Eukaryotic cells contain a much greater number of proteins with multiple domains than bacteria (77). Although the sizes of protein domains are uniformly distributed in all domains of life, in E. coli only 13% of all 4300 proteins exceed a length of 500 residues (ϳ55 kD), compared with 38% of the 5800 proteins in S. cerevisiae. Thus, the eukaryotic translation and folding machineries may have been optimized in evolution to facilitate cotranslational domain folding. This optimization may be reflected in the 5- to 10-times slower speed of translation in eukaryotes compared with bacteria and in a functional adaptation of the eukaryotic chaperone machinery. Eukaryotic TRiC, for example, may mediate cotranslational domain folding for some proteins (16, 56, 79), whereas folding in the bacterial GroEL-GroES cage is strictly posttranslational (23) (Fig. 2).
Processivity of chaperone action. The notion of cooperation between mechanistically distinct chaperones in protein folding is now firmly established (15, 16, 20, 21, 26), but how the different components of the folding machinery are functionally integrated is not yet well understood. In principle, substrate transfer between chaperones could be accomplished by free partitioning of nonnative states through the solution. However, considering the highly crowded nature of the cytosol, it is difficult to envisage how aggregation is avoided in this model. Alternatively, ordered pathways of cellular folding may ex-

ist in which different chaperones function in a processive manner to minimize the exposure of nonnative proteins to the bulk cytosol.
Whereas in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes specific chaperones are recruited to nascent chains by virtue of their affinity for the ribosome (Fig. 2), the existence of processive chaperone pathways has so far been demonstrated only in the eukaryotic system. As shown in yeast and mammalian cells, folding intermediates generated during biosynthesis are not freely exposed to the bulk cytosol, but rather are functionally compartmentalized (17, 22). In these experiments, certain nascent and newly synthesized protein chains do not bind to a heterologously expressed, noncycling mutant of GroEL (Trap-GroEL), but instead interact productively with the endogenous eukaryotic chaperones. In the specific case of actin, an obligatory substrate of TRiC, protection from exposure to the bulk cytosol during folding is mediated by PFD. The speed and efficiency of actin folding is markedly reduced in PFD-deficient yeast, with nonnative chains being released into the cytosol (17). PFD may deliver substrate proteins to TRiC by binding both to nascent chains (55, 56) and to TRiC itself (51). In addition, PFD and TRiC seem to cooperate functionally in actin folding, such that nonnative chains are not released into the cytosol during folding cycles (17) (Fig. 2C).
Another example of chaperone coupling in the eukaryotic cytosol is the cooperation between Hsc70 and Hsp90 in the folding of signal-transduction proteins (26). Substrate transfer from Hsc70 to Hsp90 is mediated by Hop (Hsp organizing protein; also known as p60), an adaptor protein that physically links both chaperones. Hop contains two tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which bind the extended COOH-terminal sequences of Hsc70 and Hsp90, respectively (80) (Fig. 3A). As shown recently, similar mechanisms are involved in regulating the transfer of nonnative or irreversibly misfolded proteins from these chaperones to the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. The protein CHIP associates with Hsp90 through an NH2-terminal TPR domain and targets certain Hsp90 substrates for degradation through a COOH-terminal ubiquitin ligase domain (81, 82). CHIP cooperates functionally with Bag-1 (see above), which binds to Hsc70 and to the proteasome (83). These findings provide the first insight into the mechanisms that integrate chaperone-assisted folding and proteolytic degradation, the two main components of protein quality control in the cytosol.
Perspectives
Recent years have seen major advances in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of chaperone-assisted protein folding. Future efforts will define more comprehensively the rules for how the thousands of different pro-

teins in a cell use the chaperone machinery. Global analyses of chaperone usage and folding properties in eukaryotes and prokaryotes will address these questions through a combination of proteomics and high-throughput protein expression (84). These studies may eventually offer a rational basis to optimize recombinant protein production in organisms that have been genetically modified to provide the appropriate folding machineries.
In addition to its biotechnological interest, understanding the complex functions of the chaperone arsenal will likely prove useful in dissecting the mechanisms by which protein misfolding and aggregation cause disease. Are chaperones capable of preventing the deposition of amyloid aggregates, and if so, why do these defense mechanisms fail in the millions of patients suffering from neurodegenerative maladies such as Alzheimer’s or Huntington’s disease? Recent reports that an up-regulation of the Hsp70 system can suppress the neurotoxicity of certain amyloidogenic proteins (85, 86) point toward molecular chaperones as promising targets in the quest for treatment of proteinmisfolding diseases.
