1. Introduction
1.1. The Case for Dynamics
Enzyme catalysis is an inherently dynamic process. Binding and release of ligands is often accompanied by conformational changes, both subtle and dramatic (reviewed more extensively in refs 1-4), and these conformational changes may be rate-limiting in the overall reaction scheme, for example in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR),5 triosephosphate isomerase (TIM),6,7 and protein kinase A.8 The catalytic step itself, by its very nature, is dynamic. Atomic fluctuations along the reaction coordinate lead to bonds being broken and new ones being formed. Binding of substrate can lead to the repositioning of catalytic groups, effectively bridging

the dynamic processes of substrate binding and catalysis.2,9 Protein vibrations and motions within the Michaelis complex itself have been hypothesized to couple to the reaction coordinate, supplying a direct link between protein dynamics and enzyme function (reviewed in refs 10-18).
Although intuitively we understand that proteins, and enzymes in particular, are dynamic molecules, the overwhelming view that emerges from structural biology is static. Protein structures from X-ray crystallography and NMR have provided important insight into the form and function of enzymes, yet they give only brief snapshots into the life of a protein. Static protein structures show only the lowest energy or “ground-state” conformation, and function may be dependent on brief excursions to higher energy conformations of the enzyme and its substrates.19-22 Structural genomics23-25 is increasing the number of snapshots available, but relevant dynamic information remains limited.16
The connections between structure, dynamics, and function have practical importance. If dynamics has consequences for function, then understanding dynamics is critical for both protein and ligand design. It will not only be necessary to position the correct catalytic groups in an engineered enzyme, but for full efficiency it will also be necessary to engineer the relevant dynamic modes into the protein of interest. This is illustrated by catalytic antibodies, which are selected to bind tightly to transition-state analogues but do not yet approach the efficiency of natural enzymes.26 This may be due to our inability to properly mimic a “transition state”, or it may be related to the dynamic information we have not selected.26,27 Enzyme catalysis involves chemical transformation, binding of substrates, and release of products, and the dynamic processes that tie these events together may not be fully appreciated or captured in the selection process. There is also growing evidence that dynamics may be important in nonbiological catalysts (see, e.g., refs 2830).
Protein dynamics is also critical for ligand or inhibitor binding. Many enzymes are key pharmacological targets, and the wealth of protein structural information has provided the foundation for many drug discovery programs. It has become apparent, however, that flexibility is key to ligand/target recognition, and this has been difficult to predict based on structural information alone. Protein flexibility may lead to unexpected ligand-binding orientations or sites and may be responsible for selectivity between related receptors.31 Protein dynamics also has a more subtle impact on ligand binding. The Gibbs free energy (∆G) determines the affinity between protein and inhibitor, and while the enthalpy component (∆H) is comparatively well-understood, entropy changes (∆S) are much more difficult to model.32,33 Enthalpy and entropy

David Boehr received a B.Sc. degree from the University of Lethbridge (Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada) in 1997 and a Ph.D. from McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) in 2003 under the supervision of Gerard D. Wright with scholarship support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada. For his Ph.D. research, he used enzyme kinetics and other traditional enzymatic techniques to study the catalytic mechanisms of various antibiotic modifying enzymes toward the goal of developing novel inhibitor strategies to overcome antibiotic resistance. He is presently a Canadian Institutes of Health Research postdoctoral fellow at the Scripps Research Institute under the direction of Peter Wright. His current research interests include the interplay of dynamics in the function of enzymes, blending both traditional enzymatic techniques and newer NMR spin relaxation methodologies.

Peter Wright received his B.Sc. degree in Chemistry from the University of Auckland in 1968, his M.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Auckland in 1969, and his Ph.D. from the University of Auckland in 1972. He received a New Zealand University Grants Committee Postdoctoral Fellowship to the University of Oxford, England, from 1972 to 1976, working under the direction of R. J. P. Williams. Dr. Wright was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Sydney in 1976, and he was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1980. He joined the faculty at The Scripps Research Institute as a Professor in 1984 and was appointed in 1987 as the Chairman of the Department of Molecular Biology. He holds the Cecil and Ida Green Chair in Biomedical Research, and he has acted as Editor-in-Chief of J. Mol. Biol. since 1990. He received an honorary M.D. degree from the Karolinska Institute, Sweden, in 1995 and an honorary D.Sc. degree from the University of Sydney, Australia, in 2003. His research interests are in applications of NMR to protein folding and intrinsically unstructured proteins, solution structure and dynamics of proteins, and protein−nucleic acid interactions.

Jane Dyson received the degree of B.Sc. (honors) from the University of Sydney in 1973 and a Ph.D. from the University of Sydney in 1977, under the direction of James Beattie. She was a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the direction of Paul Schimmel from 1977 to 1978, and she held a Damon Runyon−Walter Winchell postdoctoral award. She was appointed as a Lecturer in Chemistry at the University of New South Wales in 1979, and she joined the Scripps Research Institute in 1984, where she is presently a Professor. Her research interests are in the conformation of peptides, protein folding and dynamics, and structure and functional studies of proteins using NMR and other spectroscopic techniques.
contributions can be thought of as the “static” and “dynamic” components of ∆G, respectively.34 Entropy calculations not only must consider the entire protein-ligand complex but also must consider the solvent dynamics.32,33 The binding of ligand to an enzyme can lead to a decrease (e.g. chorismate mutase35), no net change (e.g. R-lytic protease36), or an overall increase in protein dynamics (e.g. topoisomerase I37) compared to the case of the free enzyme, and this may play an important part in providing ligand affinity. Understanding protein dynamics will lead to a more complete appreciation of its role in ligand recognition and aid in future structurebased drug design programs.38-40

1.2. Studying Protein Dynamics
Proteins undergo a wide range of motions in terms of both time and distance scales. There are atomic vibrations on the subpicosecond time scale, pico- to nanosecond backbone and side-chain fluctuations, millisecond conformational rearrangements, and slow breathing modes on the order of seconds4,41 (Figure 1). Any of these motions may be functionally significant and directly related to ligand exchange and/or catalysis. Motions of backbone and side-chain atoms may be required for molecular recognition, loop motions may be required to exclude water or for repositioning of catalytic residues, and large-scale conformational rearrangements may be required to achieve the active form of the enzyme.1-4 Thus, time scales can cover from 10-15 to >1 s over length scales of 10-2 to >10 Å.
Figure 1. Solution NMR techniques cover the complete range of dynamic events in enzymes.

An NMR Perspective on Enzyme Dynamics
Many spectroscopic and computational techniques have been developed to monitor various aspects of protein dynamics. X-ray crystallography itself yields some dynamic information. Temperature factors (B factors) are sensitive to the mean square displacements of atoms because of thermal motions and can be obtained for nearly all heavy atoms. However, they do not report on the time scale of thermal motions, and complications related to static disorder, crystal lattice contacts, and refinement protocols make their interpretation difficult.42 X-ray and neutron scattering also report on protein dynamics. X-ray scattering generally reports on global changes in protein size and shape in a time-resolved manner (reviewed in ref 43), and neutron scattering reports on amplitudes and time scales (10-12 to 10-8 s) for hydrogen atomic positions in proteins (reviewed in ref 44).
Fluorescence is an important tool in understanding protein dynamics both in the ensemble and in single molecules (reviewed in refs 45-47). Single molecule experiments are proving to be especially informative, leading to an understanding of the motions of individual protein molecules and how this translates into an ensemble signal reported by other methods.47 Single molecule techniques also offer the exciting possibility of monitoring individual protein dynamics within a true cellular context.
Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HX MS) (reviewed in refs 48 and 49) and related techniques, such as radical footprinting (reviewed in ref 50), have been very successful in studying protein dynamics in large supramolecular complexes. With HX MS, not only can dynamic information be obtained for specific sites within individual proteins, but the technique is even more powerful when studying much larger, more complex protein assemblies.48,49 The motion of the entire complex and individual proteins, and the dynamics of macromolecular assembly can all be studied by time-resolved HX MS (see, e.g., the 30S ribosome assembly in ref 51).
More specialized techniques such as Mo¨ssbauer (reviewed in refs 52 and 53), Raman (reviewed in ref 54), and 2D infrared55,56 spectroscopy are also providing new insights into protein and ligand dynamics. Computer simulations are widely used to study protein dynamics.57,58 Molecular dynamics has been traditionally limited to very short time scales (femtosecond to nanosecond) in relatively small proteins, but increasing computer power, better theoretical frameworks, and newer methodologies have been increasing both the time scales and the protein sizes amenable to computer simulation.58,59 Computer simulations serve as a theoretical basis for predicting protein motion, analyzing inputs from the wide variety of experimental techniques, and probing dynamic information beyond what can be assessed experimentally.
NMR, the focus of this review, is an especially powerful experimental technique for studying protein dynamics. The time scale available to NMR techniques ranges over 17 orders of magnitude (10-12 to 105 s), covering all of the relevant dynamic motions in proteins. With newer labeling strategies, nearly every atomic site can be probed with NMRactive nuclei.60 Probes are monitored simultaneously, yielding not only a qualitative picture of protein dynamics but in many cases also a complete kinetic and thermodynamic profile of the dynamic process. Newer TROSY (transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy) techniques are expanding the traditional size limitations of NMR,61,62 reaching up to the 900 kDa GroEL complex,63 with dynamics studies being carried

out on the 82 kDa enzyme malate synthase G64 and the 300 kDa protein ClpP.65 New in-cell NMR methodology also has the potential to provide complementary information to fluorescence studies in a biological setting.66,67 NMR provides a complete and thorough description of protein dynamics at a wide range of time scales at atomic resolution without the introduction of bulky, potentially interfering, probes.
While new methodology is being developed to study RNA/ DNA enzymes,68,69 and preliminary data point to the importance of dynamics for these catalysts,70,71 this review will focus solely on protein dynamics and solution NMR. There have been many reviews concerning NMR methodology applied to protein dynamics16,21,22,42,72-78 including a recent one that goes into much greater theoretical detail than we do here.79 The focus of the current review will remain on enzyme dynamics, although similar techniques have been applied to protein folding and protein-protein, proteinDNA, and nonenzyme receptor-ligand interactions.16,21,42,74
An important aspect that permeates much of our discussion is the concept of energy landscapes and conformational “substates”. Protein folding is generally discussed in terms of an energy landscape “folding funnel” that describes the thermodynamic progression through conformations or “substates” leading to the folded or “ground-state” conformation of the protein.80-85 Multiple folding paths, consisting of different combinations of substates, are available, and together, all available protein conformations represent the conformation ensemble. The same framework can be applied to folded proteins.84-87 Multiple protein conformations may exist in thermal equilibrium in solution, in contrast to what may be ascertained from static 3D structures. Structures solved using X-ray crystallography or NMR generally represent the lowest energy conformation and the timeaveraged conformational ensemble, respectively. The “groundstate” conformations may comprise >90% of the ensemble, but the sparsely populated, higher energy conformations can also play important roles in the catalytic cycle of an enzyme.
This review will begin with a description of the NMR methodology, followed by a discussion of selected enzyme examples to explain important insights that have been gained into protein dynamics and enzyme function from NMR studies. We conclude with a general discussion relating the “energy landscape” hypothesis to enzyme catalysis.
2. NMR Structural Probes for Protein Dynamics
Even before NMR was used to generate three-dimensional protein structures, one-dimensional 13C relaxation experiments were devised to study protein dynamics.88-95 The complexity of protein NMR spectra and the low natural abundance of the non-proton NMR-active nuclei 13C and 15N required the development of multipulse, multidimensional NMR experiments and new isotopic enrichment strategies for efficient measurement of protein relaxation.60,96-107 There have been a few studies that utilize isotopes such as 19F (e.g. 5′-fluorotryptophan in TIM108) and 31P (e.g. phosphorylation sites in PKA109), but by far, the most common nuclei employed are 15N, 13C, 2H, and 1H to study both backbone and side-chain motions. Uniform or nonspecific labeling with 15N, 13C, or 2H can be readily achieved by overexpressing proteins in Escherichia coli grown in minimal medium with a 15N-labeled nitrogen source (15(NH4)SO4 or 15NH4Cl), a 13C-labeled carbon source (e.g. 13C-glucose), or 2H2O.60 More complex labeling schemes are also available for studying

2.1. Picosecond to Nanosecond Time-Scale Motions
2.1.1. Fast Backbone and Side-Chain Motions
Backbone and side-chain fluctuations occur on the picosecond to nanosecond (ps-ns) timescale. These are traditionally studied in NMR by measuring three relaxation rates: the longitudinal relaxation rate, R1, the transverse relaxation rate, R2, and the steady-state heteronuclear NOE.99 Molecular motion in the B0 field is closely coupled to nuclear spin relaxation; molecular reorientation leads to fluctuating magnetic fields that cause transitions between nuclear spin states and cause coherences to dephase. The spectral density function, J(ω), is proportional to the amplitude of the fluctuating magnetic field at the frequency ω and is directly related to the three relaxation rates. In the earliest studies of ps-ns time scale protein dynamics, various models for protein internal motion were used to generate different spectral density functions that were then compared to the experimental data. Subsequently, Lipari and Szabo117,118 generated a spectral density function that is independent from any specific physical model for bond reorientation,

motions. An order parameter of 1.0 indicates complete
restriction of internal motion, and 0.0 indicates unrestricted
isotropic internal motion. It should be noted that it is possible to interpret S2 in a physical framework.117,119 The simplest model relates S2 to “diffusion in a cone” with semiangle, θ,

The Lipari-Szabo formalism is also known as “modelfree” analysis and is by far the most common interpretation of ps-ns enzyme dynamics; we will limit our discussion to this framework, although we note that alternative approaches

such as the SLRS (slowly relaxing local structure) model120 have proved useful. Newer developments have taken into account anisotropic macromolecular tumbling,121-125 further parametrization of S2 into picosecond (S2f) and nanosecond (S2s) contributions126 when required by model selection, and application of multiple magnetic field strengths.124,127-129
Most studies have focused on N-H bond vectors of the backbone or selected side chain residues, but a similar framework can be used with 13C and 2H to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the fast time scale motions in enzymes (Table 1). In particular, analysis of both 15N1H and 13CO-13CR bond vectors can yield more complete information regarding the ps-ns time scale motions of the protein backbone.130-132 These vectors point in different directions and can therefore sense different reorientational motions of the peptide plane. Internal motion about an axis parallel to the N-H bond vector would not contribute to the relaxation of the 15N spin but could be sensed by corresponding 13C relaxation experiments.130-132 Studies on the ribonuclease binase demonstrate that measuring 15N relaxation alone can lead to underestimations of the backbone dynamics and incorrect physical models describing the dynamics.130
Fast time-scale motions of the side chains can be readily accessed by studying methyl dynamics in uniformly 15N, 13C and partially 2H labeled proteins (Table 1). 2H relaxation is primarily quadrupolar, making contributions from other processes such as cross-correlation with neighboring 1H13C dipoles or relaxation from other nonbonded spins insignificant, thereby simplifying analysis.133 The deuterium relaxation is contained within a conventional constant-time 1H, 13C-HSQC experiment, eliminating the large deuterium line widths, and measurements are based on the attenuation of the cross-peaks in a simple 2D 1H-13C spectrum.104 Multiple coherence relaxation pathways can be assessed for 2H, providing high internal consistency.134,135
Studies on side-chain dynamics often reveal a richer tapestry of motions than backbone measurements alone. In fact, protein backbone motions remain very poor predictors of side-chain motions.136,137 While there is a general decrease in the methyl order parameter as the separation from the backbone increases, there is only a very weak correlation between the backbone amide order parameter (S2NH) and the alanine methyl axis order parameter (S2axis), and there is no significant correlation for any other amino acid residue.137 This has been shown to be the case for the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).138 Order parameters (S2axis and S2NH) collected from two complexes, with folate (E:

An NMR Perspective on Enzyme Dynamics

folate) and folate plus NADP+ (E:NADP+:folate) bound, demonstrate that the methyl order parameters decrease as the distance from the backbone increases (Figure 2), but there was significant variation for any given methyl type.138 The variation for S2axis also decreased with the number of intervening bonds from the backbone.138
There have been a few attempts to reconcile dynamic and structural characteristics of proteins. Not surprisingly, amino acids with smaller side chains tend to have greater backbone flexibility.139 However, the variation of S2NH is larger than the differences between the averages for different amino acid types. Backbone amide order parameters are also only weakly affected by secondary structure elements, with loops having only slightly smaller average S2NH values than helices or β-structures.99 Backbone S2NH values can be predicted from structures using a simple model that takes account of local contacts to the NH and CO atoms of each peptide group.140 A more sophisticated model for predicting dynamics from structure has recently been reported. 141 There is also a weak correlation of side chain order parameters with contact distance between the methyl carbon and neighboring atoms and with solvent exposure.137,142 Finally, a weak correlation between S2axis and sequence conservation has been observed, suggesting side-chain dynamics may be restricted in some evolutionarily conserved structural motifs.143 These results demonstrate that dynamics are strongly influenced by the unique three-dimensional architecture of the protein and cannot be readily predicted by the primary sequence or secondary structure of the enzyme. It is an intriguing notion that evolution may have selected for protein dynamics as well as structure, and as will be shown, dynamics affects all stages of enzymatic catalysis.
2.1.2. Order Parameters and Configurational Entropy
Protein folding has been described as a thermodynamic balance between the entropic penalty incurred on going from a highly disordered unfolded state to a highly ordered folded state, and the compensating increase in entropy realized from the release of water molecules that solvate the hydrophobic groups in the unfolded protein.144,145 The conformational entropy of the unfolded protein may be smaller than previously theorized,146 and NMR studies 147,148 demonstrate that the folded protein core is not at all rigid. This has

Chemical Reviews, 2006, Vol. 106, No. 8 3059
implications for the thermodynamic balance sheet for protein folding, which we will not discuss here, but can also have an impact on ligand exchange and catalysis in enzymes.
There have been attempts to reconcile order parameters for the fast-time scale motions with thermodynamic parameters such as entropy and heat capacity,149-153 but there is still no widely implemented method for quantifying entropy based on fast time-scale motions. Regardless, S2 can still serve as a qualitative “entropy meter”,16 reporting in a sitespecific manner on the loss, gain, and/or redistribution of configurational entropy through different conformational states of an enzyme.
Ligand binding to a protein results in the loss of six rotational degrees of freedom at a potential cost of 20-30 kcal/mol.14 This can be offset by the presence of six new degrees of freedom and the appearance of new vibrational modes within the complex.14 Thus, as generally assumed, ligand binding can result in the rigidification of the protein,33,154-156 but it can also result in an overall increase in protein dynamics or the redistribution of configurational entropy to sites outside the ligand binding pocket (Table 2).
Upon substrate binding, active sites and binding pockets may become more rigid to exclude water or to position important catalytic residues. Loops and flaps commonly close over substrates and/or inhibitors and become more ordered, such as those in β-metallo-lactamase,157,158 chorismate mutase,35 HIV protease,159 dihydrofolate reductase,160 and hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT).161 Known catalytic residues often become more ordered on the ps-ns time scale, such as in ketosteroid isomerase162 and ribonucleaseA (RNase A).153 The restriction of protein motion within the substrate-bound state may act to limit diffusion from the active site to retain substrate or reactive intermediates, exclude water to maintain a conducive dielectric environment,163,164 constrain substrate into a conformation resembling the transition state to form a “nearattack-conformation” (NAC),165 and/or optimally align reacting molecular orbitals via “orbital steering”.166 Regardless of the specific catalytic mechanism, the system must pay a thermodynamic price for ordering the active site. The favorable enthalpy contribution to the enzyme-substrate interaction, or the “intrinsic binding energy”,155 may partially or fully compensate for the entropic penalty. It is also possible that although the active site becomes more ordered upon binding substrate, there is a redistribution of entropy throughout the rest of the system. In ketosteroid isomerase, NMR studies have shown that while Tyr14, the active-site general acid, becomes highly structured upon binding the product analogue 19-nortestosterone hemisuccinate,167 the majority of residues outside the binding pocket become less ordered (Figure 3).168 Similar phenomena have been observed in adenylate kinase,169 oxalocrotonate tautomerase,170 thiopurine methyltransferase,171 and topoisomerase I.37 Redistribution of entropy may occur throughout the protein, as observed in topoisomerase I,37 or there may be specific distal regions that become less ordered upon ligand binding. For example, in the bound form of adenylate kinase, increased motion is localized to two loops that act as a “substrate binding energy counterweight” (Figure 4).169,172 In other enzymes, motion increases either at subdomain37 or intersubunit168,170 interfaces, raising the intriguing possibility that protein dynamics plays a role in allosteric regulation.32,173-177

2.2. Microsecond to Millisecond Time Scale Motions 2.2.1. Conformational Exchange
R2 relaxation rates cannot always be fully accounted for in Lipari-Szabo “model-free” analysis in terms of ps-ns time-scale motions, and a new factor, Rex, must be introduced.73,178 Rex is the relaxation rate due to conformational exchange, as nuclei sample multiple conformations and magnetic environments. This leads to broader cross-peaks that cannot be accounted for by the R1 and NOE data.

Chemical Reviews, 2006, Vol. 106, No. 8 3061

Conformational exchange processes generally occur on microsecond to millisecond (µs-ms) time scales and thus report on slower motions than S2 or τe. There is no straightforward relationship between the ps-ns and µs-ms time-scale motions. For example, experiments on enzyme systems have shown that ligand binding that decreases the ps-ns time scale motions may increase, decrease, or not affect the µs-ms time scale motions (Table 2). This obviously also has an effect on the overall entropy contribution, but this has not been fully explored.
Many biological processes occur on the µs-ms time scale, including protein folding, substrate binding, allosteric regulation, and catalysis,4,22,41 underscoring the importance of studying slower time-scale motions. In a two-site exchange process (A H B), R2 measured for substate A depends on the transverse relaxation rate constants in the absence of exchange (R02A and R02B), the populations of the states (pA and pB), the chemical shift difference of the states (∆ω ) |ωB - ωA|), and the chemical exchange rate constant kex (kex ) k1 + k-1) according to the Swift-Connick equation

Model-free analysis can give only estimates of the
magnitude of Rex and thus gives only a qualitative view of µs-ms time scale motions. Failure to correctly account for
anisotropic molecular tumbling leads to errors in Rex, further limiting the usefulness of the model-free approach for
studying exchange processes. For complete characterization of conformational exchange, R1F or R2 relaxation dispersion experiments must be used (Table 3). In these experiments,
Rex contributions are partially or fully suppressed by applying an external radio frequency (rf) field either by “spin-locking” (R1F) or by applying a series of refocusing π pulses in a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) R2 relaxation dispersion experiment (Figure 5). Plotting the relaxation rate
constant as a function of applied rf field strength then yields
dispersion curves that can be fitted to obtain values for kex, ∆ω, and pApB (Figure 5). In the case where exchange is fast on the chemical-shift time scale (i.e. kex > ∆ω), and assuming R02A ) R02B ) R02, R2 is related to the exchange parameters by

dispersion experiments at two or more external B0 field strengths and fitting residues experiencing the same conformational exchange process with global kex and pApB values.182 In favorable cases, the sign of ∆ω can also be determined
through comparison of HSQC and HMQC spectra at a single
spectrometer frequency, or by measurement of HSQC spectra at multiple external field strengths.180
By far the most common experiment to study µs-ms
protein dynamics utilizes R2 relaxation dispersion; only a few studies have reported on enzyme dynamics using R1F methodology. However, R1F experiments can use higher effective rf field strengths, allowing the study of faster (µs time scale) motions,183-187 and there have also been attempts to extend R1F methodology into slower time scales.188-190 The most common spin probe is 15N, with CPMG pulse sequences available to study single quantum,191,192 zero quantum,193 double quantum,193 and multiple quantum194 coherences for backbone and side-chain195 groups in both TROSY196 and non-TROSY formats (Table 3). The study
of multiple coherences is especially relevant when conformational exchange is more complicated than two-site.193,194
Complementary information can be obtained by studying 13C197,198 and 1H relaxation dispersion.198-200 These probes
may undergo different conformational exchange processes
and give additional insight into the excited protein states
being sampled. The chemical shifts of the three nuclei report on different conformational parameters,201,202 with contributions to 1H and 15N chemical shifts being the most complicated. However, 13CR and 13CO chemical shifts depend primarily on local dihedral angles,202 potentially enabling
direct structural studies on sparsely populated, high energy
protein substates. In cases where there is a suitable reference
state, ∆ωN and ∆ωH also give valuable structural insight into

The enzyme must sample a higher energy conformation that allows access to the internal cavity. This figure was generated using MOLMOL354 with data taken from
refs 195 and 208.

2.2.2. Slow Motions in the Model Enzyme T4 Lysozyme
The power of using R2 relaxation dispersion experiments in studying µs-ms protein dynamics is exemplified by the enzyme T4 lysozyme. Phage T4 lysozyme has long served as a model system for understanding the relationships between structure, protein folding, and enzyme function.209-216 More recently, a point mutant of the enzyme, Leu99Ala, has served as a model system for understanding the relationship between ligand binding and µs-ms time-scale motions. This mutation strongly reduces the thermal stability of the protein,209,210 although the overall three-dimensional structure is nearly identical to that of the wild-type.217 The most significant change to the structure is the enlargement of an internal cavity that has been shown to bind small, hydrophobic aromatic compounds and xenon,209-212 even though the cavity is completely buried in the protein interior and is inaccessible to solvent, as judged from the static crystal structure. This suggests that the protein must access a higher energy conformation that somehow exposes the cavity to solvent, thereby allowing entry of xenon and the other ligands.
Model-free analysis showed little change in backbone S2NH and methyl side-chain S2axis order parameters between wildtype (WT) T4 lysozyme and the Leu99Ala mutant protein, suggesting similar ps-ns dynamics, but new Rex terms emerged for both backbone and side-chain groups surrounding the cavity in Leu99Ala that were not present in the WT enzyme.218 This finding prompted further work to study µsms time-scale motions using 15N probes for backbone19 and side-chain195 groups and 13C probes for methyl side-chain dynamics19,207 using R2 and R1F188 relaxation dispersion methods. More than 150 backbone and 75 side chain sites19 were monitored for conformational exchange. As in the model-free study, only amino acid residues surrounding the cavity showed significant µs-ms time-scale motion19 in the Leu99Ala mutant that was not present in the WT enzyme208 (Figure 6). Data for both 15N backbone and 13C methyl side-

chain sites were well fit to a two-site exchange model.19 Individual values for kex clustered around a narrow distribution and were subsequently fit to a dominant global exchange process with kex values at 25 °C of 1030 s-1 and 1370 s-1 for 15N and 13C probes, respectively.19 The similarity between these exchange rate constants and the off-rate constants of the ligands (325-800 s-1) suggests ligand binding and protein dynamics are coupled.19 Thermodynamic parameters for the exchange process were also extracted by repeating the experiment at seven temperatures (10-28 °C).19 The less populated conformation was found to be 2 kcal/mol higher in energy than the ground-state complex, with unfavorable enthalpy (7.1 kcal/mol) and favorable entropy contributions (5.1 kcal/mol). The partially compensating increase in disorder suggested a local unfolding of the protein to allow the ligands access to the internal cavity.19
These elegant studies on T4 lysozyme allowed for a complete structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic characterization of the µs-ms time-scale motions for both the backbone and side-chain groups. Similarly, rigorous studies on other enzymes have the capacity to reveal the role that higher energy protein substates play in other aspects of enzyme catalysis. The following case studies will highlight the role of protein dynamics in various phases of the catalytic cycle with special emphasis on the role of µs-ms time-scale motions that are on the same time scale as the events in catalysis.
3. Case Studies in Enzyme Dynamics
3.1. Conformational Selection in Ribonuclease A
RNase A is a small (13.7 kDa) enzyme responsible for cleaving single-stranded RNA, specifically on the 3′-side of pyrimidine residues.219 The enzyme is secreted from the pancreas and is believed to function primarily as a digestive enzyme.153,219 RNaseA has a long history in serving as a model enzyme for functional and structural studies (reviewed

in ref 219). There are over 100 structures of RNaseA in the
protein databank (PDB). The enzyme consists of two
antiparallel β-sheets, each containing three β-strands, which
form a V-shaped motif. Three R-helices and six loop/turn
regions pack against the central β-sheet core. The enzyme
is further stabilized by disulfide bonds between eight cysteine
residues to form a very rigid structure (Figure 7). Model-free analysis of free RNaseA 153,220 provides direct
evidence that the protein is very rigid on the ps-ns time scale. The binding of the nanomolar inhibitor pTppAp (5′phosphothymidine(3′,5′)pyrophosphate adenosine 3′-phosphate) further increases S2NH throughout the enzyme (Figure 7).153 In this case, there is no redistribution of configurational
entropy as observed for enzymes such as 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase,170 and even residues outside the active-site pocket exhibit increased S2NH (Figure 7).153 However, the temperature dependence of S2NH, a measure of entropy, reveals a redistribution of heat capacity (∆Cp) upon inhibitor binding.153 There is no net change in heat capacity but only
residue-specific changes with a balance of positive and negative contributions (Figure 7).153 The NMR measurements are consistent with theoretical calculations153,221,222 that
suggest the backbone provides 40-45% of the residual
configurational entropy upon protein folding.
While RNase is rigid on the ps-ns time scale, it is
significantly more flexible on the µs-ms time scale. The

µs-ms time scale motions are very similar between free and inhibitor bound enzyme (Figure 8).153,206 15N R2 relaxation dispersion allowed for kinetic (kex), thermodynamic (pApB), and structural (∆ω) characterization of the conformational exchange processes.206 A correlation was observed between the ∆ω values for the free- and inhibitor-bound enzyme, suggesting that a structurally similar process occurs in both cases (Figure 8).206 The µs-ms time scale motions in the inhibitor-bound enzyme are not due to ligand binding/release, since the population of free enzyme is only 0.02%, considerably less than the measured population (pb) of the higher energy conformer.206 These results suggest that RNaseA is in dynamic equilibrium between two conformations representing the free and inhibitor-bound forms of the enzyme.206 The agreement between kex and ligand off-rates observed in RNaseA is consistent with a functional role for the higher energy conformation.206 In this scenario, the higher-energy protein conformation is responsible for binding ligand in the free form, and the higher-energy conformation in the inhibitor-bound form is involved in the release of ligand. This represents a process of “conformational selection”: 83,223-229 a ligand binds to a sparsely populated, higher energy conformation that is more complimentary to the ligand than is the “ground-state” conformation and, through binding, the free energy of the complex is reduced such that the higher energy substate becomes the new highly populated “ground-

state” conformation (Figure 9). A very recent study shows that a similar process occurs in the 3′-CMP-bound RNaseA product complex.230 The dynamic process is disrupted by mutating Asp121, a strictly conserved residue that does not make any direct contact with substrate or product.230 Mutation of Asp121 to Ala results in a 90% loss of catalytic activity.231 In Asp121Ala, there is “dynamic uncoupling” such that some residues can no longer be fit globally to the same kex.230 However, the ∆ω values do not change, implying that the structural changes are identical between the wild-type and Asp121Ala.230 Asp121 is thus conserved not because it is involved directly in the chemical transformation but because it is involved in coordinating dynamic events important for catalysis.230

Figure 9. Schematic figure showing potential mechanisms for interaction between enzymes and ligands. Lock-and-key355 and induced-fit343 assume conformational homogeneity, but conformational selection224 takes into account conformational heterogeneity. The conformational ensemble may also be altered by allosteric ligands binding to alternative sites on the enzyme.
Conformational selection is in the spirit of the MonodWyman-Changeux (MWC) mechanism of allosteric transitions,232 and it can now be applied to “nonallosteric” proteins.83,174,175,228 Enzyme inhibitors disturbing the equilibrium between free and bound conformations would have the ability to reduce substrate binding even if the inhibitorbinding pocket is distant to the active site.83,175,228 As we will discuss below, NMR and computer simulations suggest that protein dynamics are often correlated between distant, solvent-exposed residues and catalytically important, activesite residues, and thus, an opportunity exists to develop “allosteric” inhibitors for “nonallosteric” enzymes.233-235 This approach would be especially powerful in situations where inhibitor/drug resistance develops, as it provides additional sites outside the substrate binding pocket that could be targeted. Protein dynamics, revealed by NMR and other techniques, thus provide new complexities and new opportunities in structure-based drug design.31,38-40
3.2. Reaction Coordinate Compression in E. coli Dihydrofolate Reductase
DHFR is an extremely well characterized enzyme in both structural and mechanistic terms.5 The enzyme catalyzes stereospecific hydride transfer from C4 of NADPH to the C6 position of 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) to form 5,6,7,8tetrahydrofolate (THF). The enzyme is ubiquitous, and its central role in the maintenance of cellular pools of THF makes it an attractive target for antibacterial, antimalarial, and anticancer agents.236-238 The complete kinetic mechanism for wild-type E. coli DHFR239 and a number of mutant enzymes has been elucidated.240-243 The E. coli enzyme cycles through five intermediates, E:NADPH, E:DHF: NADPH, E:THF:NADP+, E:THF, and E:THF:NADPH. Importantly, there is rebinding of NADPH prior to the release of THF product so that free enzyme is never generated under steady-state turnover conditions at cellular concentrations of substrate and cofactor. Moreover, the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle is not hydride transfer but the release of THF from the E:THF:NADPH ternary product release complex.239
There are over 40 X-ray structures of E. coli DHFR,5 and importantly, there are isomorphous crystal structures for all of the intermediates or models of the intermediates that delineate the conformational changes that occur throughout the catalytic cycle.244,245 The 159-residue enzyme consists of a central eight-stranded β-sheet (β-strands A-H) and four flanking R-helices (RB, RC, RE, and RF) (Figure 10).

protein can be divided into two subdomains, the smaller adenosine binding domain (residues 38-88) and the major subdomain (sometimes called the loop subdomain), with the active-site cleft between them. The major subdomain contains three important loops: the Met20 loop (residues 9-24) closes over the active-site pocket, and the FG (residues 116-132) and GH (residues 142-150) loops stabilize the various conformations of the Met20 loop. There are four conformations of the Met20 loop that have been observed in the crystalline state, with the closed and occluded conformations being most important to the catalytic process.246 In the substrate binding complexes, E:NADPH and E:folate: NADPH, the Met20 loop forms a closed conformation; however, upon hydride transfer, there is a closed-to-occluded conformational change in the Met20 loop245,246 (Figure 10). In the occluded conformation, the nicotinamide ring is pushed out into the solvent and is sterically hindered from entering the active-site pocket. Thus, only the closed conformation is conducive to catalysis. The closed conformation is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between Gly15 (CO) and Gly17 (NH) of the Met20 loop and Asp122 (NH and Oδ) in the FG loop, but in the occluded conformation, these hydrogen bonds are broken and new ones are formed between Asn23 (CO and NH) and Ser148 (NH and Oγ) in the GH loop.245

The ps-ns time-scale motions of the enzyme have been probed in three complexes, E:folate, E:folate:NADP+, and E:folate:5,6-dihydroNADPH (DHNADPH).138,160,247,248 E:folate
and E:folate:DHNADPH are both occluded complexes and
serve as models for the E:THF and product ternary complexes (E:THF:NADP+/E:THF:NADPH), respectively. The Met20 loop in E:folate:NADP+ is in a closed conformation
with both the pterin ring of folate and the nicotinamide ring
of the cofactor inserted into the active-site pocket, and so
this complex serves as a model for the E:DHF:NADPH Michaelis complex. Model-free analysis of 15N relaxation
data for the two occluded complexes gave very similar results.160 Several residues in the Met20 and FG loops have below-average S2NH values with internal correlation times on the order of 1-2 ns. However, the motions in the Met20
and FG loops are attenuated in the closed Michaelis model complex, with increased S2NH and/or loss of nanosecond (τe) time-scale motion (Figure 10). A similar phenomenon is observed in the side-chain S2axis methyl order parameters.138 There is general restriction of the ps-ns time scale motions in the Met20 and FG loops in the closed E:folate:NADP+
complex, as compared to E:folate. Side-chain order param-
eters also increase for those residues around the nicotinamide binding pocket138 (Figure 10). The tightening of the Met20
loop over the active-site pocket and the decrease in fast time-

scale motions may be important for limiting diffusion into and out of the pocket and for maintaining the nicotinamide ring in a conformation conducive to hydride transfer.
The ps-ns dynamics for the occluded complexes E:folate and E:folate:DHNADPH are very similar, suggesting that the determining factor is the closed or occluded conformation of the enzyme. While the fast time-scale dynamics appear to be ligand nonspecific, R2 relaxation dispersion studies of the various intermediates in the DHFR catalytic cycle suggest that motions on the µs-ms time scale are influenced by the nature of the bound ligands205 (Boehr et al., in preparation). Studies of the slower time-scale motions of the closed E:folate:NADP+ complex, a model for the Michaelis complex, reveal significant exchange contributions to relaxation at several sites in the polypeptide chain.205 Chemical shift perturbation studies have identified sets of marker resonances that report on cofactor binding, substrate/product binding, and the closed-occluded conformational change.249 The most significant Rex terms for the E:folate:NADP+ complex arise for the “closed-occluded transition” markers (Figure 11A). Moreover, the ∆ω values determined from global fits of the dispersion curves for these and other residues with significant Rex values correlate with the equilibrium chemical shift differences ∆δ between the closed E:folate:NADP+ complex and the occluded E:folate:DHNADPH complex (Figure 11B). This suggests that the E:folate:NADP+ complex, which adopts a closed conformation in its ground state, samples a higher energy excited state in which the active-site loops are in the occluded conformation. The kinetics for this conformational exchange is very similar to the hydride transfer rate, pointing toward its importance to the catalytic cycle.
The Rex values for the E:folate:NADP+ complex are quite different from those of the E:folate binary complex, determined from model-free analysis160 and R2 relaxation dispersion data (McElheny et al., unpublished). In E:folate, Rex terms, which are absent for E:folate:NADP+, are observed for residues whose chemical shifts report on cofactor binding, suggesting that motions in the cofactor binding pocket are important for binding NADP(H). Indeed, the ∆ω values for these residues correlate with equilibrium ∆δ values for binding of cofactor (unpublished data), suggesting that the enzyme samples a high energy state in which the conformation of the (empty) adenosine binding site resembles that of the cofactor bound complex. These results provide strong support for a mechanism in which cofactor binding occurs by a process of conformational selection.
Slower time-scale motions may also play a critical role in catalysis. Several isoleucine, threonine, and valine residues undergo dynamic rotamer averaging about the χ1 dihedral angle on the µs-ms time-scale, as evidenced by linebroadening.138 This includes Ile14 and Ile94, which both populate the gauche+ and trans rotamers in solution; however, in the X-ray structures, only the gauche+ conformation is observed.245 In the trans conformation, the side chains of these residues would overlap significantly with atoms of the nicotinamide and pterin rings, respectively. This unfavorable interaction could be overcome by motion of the rings toward one another, thus shortening the hydride donoracceptor distance (Figure 12). Based on kinetic isotope effects (KIE), the DHFR reaction is significantly influenced by hydrogen tunneling events.250-253 Hydrogen tunneling and hydride transfer are highly distance-dependent,254-256 and so, rotamer averaging and side-chain motion could significantly affect enzyme catalysis.138 Optimal geometry for hydride

(B) The correlation between dynamic chemical shift (∆ω) and equilibrium chemical shift (∆δ) changes indicates that E:DHNADPH: folate, an occluded complex, is a good model for the higher energy conformation of E:NADP+:folate, a closed complex. “Closedoccluded transition” markers are highlighted in red. The sign of ∆ω was determined through comparison of HSQC/HMQC spectra180 for most of the resonances (filled circles).
transfer requires that hydride donor and acceptor atoms approach within 0.8 Å of their van der Waals radii, and thus, the trans rotameric substate observed by NMR could play a role in stabilization of the transition state.255 Consistent with this notion, mutation of Ile14 leads to a 20-fold reduction in the hydride transfer rate.257 The coupling of motion and hydride transfer has been studied extensively in alcohol dehydrogenases and related enzymes.258
Several residues showing rotamer averaging in the E:folate: NADP+ model of the Michaelis complex have similar rotamer distributions (major rotamer ∼ 65% and minor rotamer ∼ 35%). These include residues Val10, Val13, Ile14, Thr113, Ile115, and Val119,138 all of which are near each other in the 3D structure (Figure 12), providing strong evidence that the rotamer jumps of these side chains are correlated. This is in marked contrast to the case of the E:folate complex, where rotamer populations are more

(B) In the minor trans rotamer, Ile14 and Ile94 would sterically clash with nicotinamide cofactor (yellow) and folate substrate (dark gray), respectively.

Thus, NMR is consistent with computer simulation and KIEs that suggest protein dynamics are intimately linked with hydride transfer.
3.3. Substrate Binding and Drug Resistance in HIV Protease
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease is an important target for development of drugs against AIDS. The

Boehr et al.
protease is a major determinant in the life cycle of HIV, cleaving the Gag and Pol polyproteins into mature structural proteins, and inhibition of the enzyme leads to the production of noninfectious particles.267,268 HIV protease has served as a paradigm for structure-based drug design, with several potent protease inhibitors already in clinical use.269-271 However, the emergence of protease variants resistant to the inhibitors compromises drug treatment.269-271 While several of the responsible mutations occur around the active-site pocket, distant mutations can also lead to a decrease in inhibitor sensitivity or compensate for activity lost by mutation to the active-site residues.272 The HIV protease is very plastic and remains a resilient drug target.
The HIV protease is a 22 kDa homodimer. The “flaps” (residues 34-59), a pair of two-stranded β-sheets at the top of the protein, control access to the active-site pocket (Figure 13). Molecular dynamics simulations have also identified the “fulcrum” (residues 11-21) and the “cantilever” (residues 64-74) as regions of increased mobility (Figure 12).273-276 Crystal structures reveal heterogeneous flap structures, ranging from a closed conformation when inhibitor is bound277,278 to semiopen conformations.279-281 However, neither of these conformations allow substrate access to the active site,277 suggesting that the protein must access minor, higher energy conformations that would allow ligand exchange to occur.
The faster time-scale motions have been compared for free enzyme159 and enzyme bound to the inhibitors DMP323,282,283 KNI-272,284 and P9941.282 The inhibitor-bound forms display very similar backbone motions on the ps-ns time scale. Smaller than average S2NH values are observed for residues 17-19 in the fulcrum, 38-42 in the flaps, and 69-71 in the cantilever,282,284 in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations274 (Figure 13). The smallest S2NH values are found for residues in the loops of the flaps, sometimes called the “flap elbows”. The free enzyme has similar regions of increased flexibility, and in addition, the flap “tips” (residues 49-53) have below average S2NH values159 (Figure 13).
The increased ps-ns time-scale motions in the flap tips of the free HIV protease have led to the suggestion that these motions may be important for further opening of the flaps to allow ligand access to the active site.159 Experiments that probe motions at slower time scales also indicate that the flap tips are flexible on the µs-ms time scale,285 for both free and inhibitor-bound enzymes (Figure 13). R2 relaxation dispersion experiments have been used to probe the backbone dynamics of the DMP323-bound enzyme using 1H amide,198-200 15N,198-200,285 and 13CO198 relaxation experiments. The use of multiple probes allows for a more complete dynamic picture.198 Depending on chemical shift differences between the lowest energy and higher energy protein conformations, different Rex values are observed for the various nuclei. The different probes thus supply complementary data and give more detailed structural insights into the higher energy conformations (Figure 13).198
In addition to the residues in flap tips, residues in the intersubunit β-strand also undergo significant conformational exchange processes reflected by both main-chain198-200,285 and side-chain resonances.286,287 The µs-ms motion is increased upon binding inhibitor,285 suggesting redistribution of entropy onto a longer time scale. The increased motion at the dimer interface may be biologically relevant and may play a role in the maturation process of the protease.285

An NMR Perspective on Enzyme Dynamics
Figure 13. Multiple time-scale motions in the free and inhibitor bound HIV protease. (A) The HIV protease homodimer bound with DMP323 (PDB 4PHV) shows decreased S2NH primarily in three regions: the flap “elbows”, the fulcrum, and the cantilever. Free enzyme also shows decreased S2NH in the flap tips. (B and C) µsms motion in free and DMP323 enzyme, respectively, with residues showing significant Rex from 1HN (blue) or 15N (red) relaxation studies shown as colored balls. (D) R2 relaxation dispersion studies with 1HN (blue), 15N (red), and 13CO (gold) identify other residues undergoing conformational exchange, indicated by colored balls. The dimer interface is especially dynamic on the µs-ms time scale that may be important for function, and identifies this region as a potential target for inhibitor design. This figure was produced using MOLMOL354 with data from refs 159, 198, and 285.

Chemical Reviews, 2006, Vol. 106, No. 8 3069
Regions with reduced S2 values, including the flaps, fulcrum, and cantilever, may be related in their dynamical processes, but NMR alone is not able to decipher these interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations can recapitulate the experimental S2NH values, and computer simulations further suggest that the ps-ns protein motions are correlated.273 The coupling of the motions between the flaps, fulcrum, and cantilever is also correlated to motions of the substrate that are important for catalysis.273 This is analogous to the situation observed in DHFR, but here, promoting motions are important for heavy atom, rather than hydride, transfer.273 A similar argument for promoting motions involved in heavy atom transfer has been made for nucleoside phosphorylase.288
Several of the “compensatory mutations” in HIV protease are found in or near regions of above-average ps-ns mobility. These mutations may restore or alter the promoting motions in resistant mutants with reduced catalytic activity. The time-averaged or “ground-state” structures of HIV protease with and without compensatory mutations may be almost identical but differ in their dynamical qualities.272 This suggests an evolutionary mechanism for drug resistance that is dependent on distal mutations and favorable changes in protein dynamics. There is also potential to use these observations in drug design, either by synthesizing more flexible inhibitors to accommodate heterogeneous receptors or by targeting small molecules against distant parts of the enzyme involved in coordinated movement. The flaps and the dimer interface are attractive targets for inhibitor binding,270 and NMR has shown both regions to be dynamic on the µs-ms time scale.
3.4. Protein Dynamics during Turnover in Cyclophilin A
Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase implicated in a variety of biological reactions such as protein folding and intracellular protein transport.289-291 It is the major target of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A, although the exact mechanism of action is not yet known.292 The enzyme is also required for HIV infectivity. CypA is packaged into HIV virions, and NMR studies have shown that CypA can catalyze isomerization of the HIV capsid protein, implying a direct role for CypA in the life cycle of HIV.293
The simple nature of the chemical reaction suggests that CypA is a good model system for understanding the connections between structure, function, and protein dynamics, especially in relation to the catalytic step itself.78 Along these lines, ps-ns and µs-ms time-scale motions were monitored for CypA during enzymatic turnover, using a model peptide as substrate.294 Variation of the substrate concentration allowed the teasing apart of the motions due to substrate binding/product release and chemical transformation.294 T1 and NOE values for the backbone amides did not change appreciably, suggesting little difference in the ps-ns time-scale motions as catalysis proceeds.294 However, 10 residues showed changes in R2 values as a function of substrate concentration and were identified as undergoing conformational exchange294 (Figure 14). The substrate concentration dependence of nine of these residues can be explained purely on the basis of binding events: however, a model encompassing both substrate binding and the isomerization step itself was required to explain the relaxation behavior of Arg55. This suggests that, during chemical

Residues showing increased R2 during turnover are shown in red, and residues exhibiting conformational exchange in the presence and absence of substrate are shown in green.294 Residues 68 and 72 (shown in orange) show chemical exchange in the absence of substrate, but an increase in its presence. Hydrogen bonds between Arg55 (blue) and peptide (pink) are shown as dotted lines.
transformation, Arg55 experiences µs-ms time-scale motions on the same time scale as isomerization. Arg55 has been identified as a critical residue for catalysis.293,295 The side-chain guanidino group of Arg55 is hydrogen bonded to the prolyl nitrogen of the substrate and has been suggested to promote isomerization by weakening the double bond character of the peptide bond294-297 (Figure 15B). Computer simulations suggest that Arg55 is part of a conserved network of motionally coupled residues extending from surface regions to the active site; this motion is directly implicated in transition-state barrier crossing.289,298
The results with CypA stand in stark contrast to what is generally assumed about the rigidness of an enzyme active site during catalysis. In CypA, movement of Arg55 and not rigidity are critical for chemical transformation.289,294,298 NMR studies in other enzymes, such as R-lytic protease,299 DNA polymerase β,300 low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase,301 binase,302 and thioesterase/protease I,303 have also noted µs-ms time-scale motions of catalytically important amino acid residues on the same time scale as chemical transformation. In R-lytic protease, lyophilization induces a conformational change such that His57, an important residue interacting with the catalytic triad of the protease, is less mobile and catalytic activity is reduced.299 The application of mild pressure reverses the conformational change, increases the mobility of His57, and restores catalytic activity.299 All of these results point toward a dynamic active site, and computer simulations for a number of enzymes, as discussed above, suggest that these molecular excursions are critically important for catalysis 265,273,288,289
More quantitative information on µs-ms time-scale motions in CypA with and without substrate was obtained through backbone 15N and side-chain 13C R2 relaxation

Figure 15. µs-ms time-scale motions in cyclophilin A during rest and turnover. When the enzyme is actively catalyzing cis/trans isomerization, a single global kex (2730 s-1) dominates for both 15N backbone (blue and red) and 13C methyl side-chain (black) resonances. Similar residues exhibit conformational exchange in the resting enzyme, but some residues are fit to a global kex of 1140 s-1 (red) and other residues to a kex of 2260 s-1 (blue). (A) The correlation between ∆ω values for the resting and working enzymes suggests similar processes, and thus, the “intrinsic dynamics” of CypA are important for catalysis. (B) The residues plotted in panel A are shown as colored balls on the structure of CypA (PDB 1RMH). This figure was generated in part by MOLMOL354 with data from ref 304.
dispersion experiments.304 Conformational exchange measured during turnover for both 15N and 13C probes could be fit with a global kex of 2730 s-1. This value corresponds very well with the sum of the rate constants of cis-to-trans and trans-to-cis isomerization (kex ) 2500 s-1), providing further support for intimate links between protein motion and catalysis in CypA.304 Many of the same regions in the free enzyme experience µs-ms time-scale motions similar to those observed with bound substrate304 (Figure 15). The majority of the residues could be fit globally to a kex of 1140 s-1, smaller than what is observed during turnover. Similar to what was observed in RNaseA and DHFR, there was a significant correlation between ∆ω and ∆δ (EScis - EStrans), suggesting that free CypA exists in a highly skewed and dynamic equilibrium between a “ground-state” and an “excited-state” conformation304 (Figure 15). Mutational analyses of residues experiencing µs-ms time-scale motions altered the populations of the major and minor substates without significantly affecting either kex or ∆ω values.304 This analysis included both active-site and distant residues, and while only the active-site mutations affected catalytic activity (kcat/Km), nearly all mutations reduced substrate affinity.304 This provides further support to the conformational selection hypothesis outlined above for RNaseA and DHFR. Substrate

binds to a minor protein conformation; reduction of the population of this conformation leads to a decrease in the apparent substrate binding affinity.
It is intriguing that most of the same dynamic processes detected during catalysis are also present in the free enzyme. However, this may not be the case for other enzymes. CypA catalyzes a one-substrate reaction, and its simplicity may not be representative of protein dynamics in more complex systems. Our own studies on DHFR demonstrate that µsms time-scale motions are very ligand specific, in marked contrast to what is observed in CypA.160,205 Detailed studies of additional systems will be needed to determine the general extent of ligand-specific and nonspecific µs-ms time-scale dynamics in enzymes.
3.5. Mesophilic and Thermophilic Enzymes: Adenylate Kinase and Ribonuclease HI
Adenylate kinase (AK) is a ubiquitous enzyme involved in controlling the cellular energy balance by catalyzing the interconversion between ATP/AMP and two ADP molecules.305 Over 20 crystal structures of the 23.6 kDa enzyme have been solved, and they reveal a very large conformational change as the enzyme progresses through its catalytic cycle.306,307 The enzyme can be divided into three major domains, the CORE, AMPbind, and LID domains (Figure 4). The AMPbind and LID domains close over the AMP- and ATP-binding sites, respectively, in response to ligand binding (Figure 4). We have already mentioned briefly the studies on the ps-ns time-scale motions of the enzyme from E.coli;169,172 similar motions have been reported for both the E.coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis apoenzymes.308 In the E. coli enzyme, there is loss of motion in the flexible AMPbind and LID domains upon binding the two-substrate mimic AP5A (P1,P5-bis(5′-adenosine)pentaphosphate).169,172 However, there is a corresponding increase in the ps-ns time-scale motions for two loops in the CORE domain that act as an “energetic counterweight” (Figure 4). These CORE domain loops are rigid in the free enzyme, but S2NH decreases with inhibitor bound.169,172
The µs-ms time-scale motions of mesophilic (E. coli) and thermophilic (Aquifex aeolicus) AKs have been compared during enzymatic turnover, using experiments similar to those performed for CypA.204 Conformational exchange was detected for residues throughout both proteins (Figure 16), and the relaxation dispersion data for the exchanging residues could be fit with a similar global kex ∼ 1600-1700 s-1.204 The observed correlation between ∆ω and ∆δ(E - E:AMP: AMPPNP) suggests that, in both enzymes, the AMPbind and LID domains open and close over the active-site pocket during catalytic turnover (Figure 16). However, the populations of the ground and excited substates were different for the mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes, resulting in different lid opening rates (kopen) at 303 K. In both cases, kopen compared favorably to kcat. For E. coli AK, the kopen derived from R2 relaxation dispersion experiments was 44 s-1 and kcat ∼ 30 s-1, whereas, for the A. aeolicus enzyme, kopen ∼ 286 s-1 and kcat ∼ 263 s-1. This implies that the rate-determining step in AK is lid opening, which is likely an important event in the release of product. Moreover, the differences in the rates for mesophilic and thermophilic AKs can be completely accounted for by slower lid opening in the A. aeolicus enzyme.204 At higher temperature, the thermophilic enzyme exhibits a higher kex (>10,000 s-1 at 333 K) and a corresponding increase in kcat.

Chemical Reviews, 2006, Vol. 106, No. 8 3071
Figure 16. µs-ms time-scale motions reporting on the closeopen conformational change in mesophilic E. coli (blue) and thermophilic A. aeolicus (red) adenylate kinase. (A) The dynamic chemical shift (∆ω) changes observed for the ADP (circle) and AMPPNP/AMP (triangle) complexes correlate to an open-close conformational change (∆δ). Exchange rate constants in AK correspond to kcat, suggesting that opening of the active-site pocket and product release are rate limiting and that kinetic differences between mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes arise solely due to different lid opening rates. (B) The amide nitrogens whose resonances were used to generate panel A are plotted onto E. coli AK (PDB 4AKE), colored red and blue, correspondingly, with magenta balls corresponding to amide nitrogens with both red and blue data points in panel A. The figure was generated in part by MOLMOL354 with data taken from ref 204.
In AK, as in many other enzymes, the chemical transformation step is not rate limiting. Conformational fluctuations in an enzyme are very often rate limiting, and the ratedetermining step frequently involves product release. NMR studies on other enzymes, such as the ribonuclease binase,302 triosephosphate isomerase,309,310 and OMP synthase,311 have also implicated protein dynamics in rate-determining ligand release.
Structures tend to be similar between mesophilic and thermophilic pairs, and important catalytic residues are conserved.312-314 This suggests that the chemical mechanisms are also very similar, and so, chemistry alone, especially within a static framework, cannot explain the kinetic differences between the enzymes. It has been suggested that homologous enzymes adjust their flexibility to perform

catalysis at their physiologically relevant temperatures.315,316 However, more complicated changes in protein dynamics than are observed in AKs may evolve. For instance, a comparison of relaxation parameters between mesophilic and thermophilic ribonuclease HI (RNaseHI) at 310 K demonstrated that more residues in the thermophilic enzyme experience conformational exchange317,318 (Figure 17). There are also regions in the polypeptide backbone that experience greater ps-ns time-scale motions in the mesophilic enzyme, and other regions where the opposite is true. A temperature titration of the Rex values reveals heightened activation energy barriers for the thermophilic RNaseHI.317 An increase in energy barrier height would shift the dynamics to a slower time scale, as observed for the thermophilic enzyme. At higher temperatures, these barriers would more readily be overcome, increasing enzyme dynamics that may be important for optimal catalysis.
The results for AK and RNaseHI suggest multiple paths to the same goal of balancing flexibility and function with stability. In AK, the differences in the µs-ms time-scale motions may be traced to the energy differences between the substates, but in RNaseHI, differences may also be attributed to the energy barrier connecting the substates. Further study of psychrophilic-mesophilic-thermophilic enzymes,316,319 or enzymes found in other extreme environments,320 can determine to what extent these pathways or alternative pathways determine the connections between flexibility and enzyme function. These mechanistic questions are not merely of academic interest, as many of these “extremozymes” have industrial uses,321,322 and NMR can play a role in the optimization of these important catalysts.
3.6. Protein Dynamics in Larger Enzymes
The results we have discussed so far have focused on fairly small enzyme systems (<25 kDa). Traditionally, NMR has been size-limited, owing partly to a decrease in sensitivity as R2 increases as a function of molecular weight. However, newer TROSY techniques are opening the methodology to larger enzyme systems.62,63,323-326 TROSY operates by selectively recording only the slowly decaying components of the NMR signal. For example, for a 1H-15N pair, the 1H

NMR signal is a doublet, with the two resonance lines representing 1H coupled to “spin up” and “spin down” 15N. The signals are normally collapsed by “decoupling”, and the relaxation rates for the two resonances are averaged. However, the multiplet components have different relaxation rates; TROSY experiments select exclusively the slower decaying resonance. This can lead to a decrease in signal intensity for smaller proteins, but the favorable relaxation rate more than compensates for this loss in larger proteins.62
The technique is especially suitable for proteins with molecular mass greater than 15-20 kDa at field strengths greater than 700 MHz (1H).
TROSY techniques have been applied to study both psns and µs-ms time scale motions of malate synthase G (MSG),64 an 82-kDa enzyme that catalyzes the Claisen condensation of glyoxylate with an acetyl group from acetylCoA to produce malate.327,328 MSG is a potential target for antimicrobial agents.328 The structure of MSG has been determined in complex with glyoxylate328 and in an abortive ternary complex with pyruvate (glyoxylate mimic) and acetyl-CoA (AcCoA)329 by X-ray crystallography, and more recently, the ligand-free structure has been solved by solution NMR.330 There are four major domains of the enzyme, including the “core” composed of a parallel, eight-stranded β-sheet surrounded by eight R-helices, an R-helical “clasp” in the N-terminus, an R/β domain appended to the core, and a C-terminus five-helix “plug”330 (Figure 18). A comparison between the apoenzymes and ligand-bound enzymes did not reveal any major conformational rearrangement upon binding substrate.330
NMR studies have focused on ps-ns and µs-ms sidechain motions of MSG. Several methyl groups with decreased S2axis values have been identified in the apoenzyme, including residues in the R/β domain (Val155, Ile309, and Val310), in the linker between the core and the C-terminal plug (Val556 and Leu581), and in the loops connecting the four domains (Leu91, Val92, Ile260, and Ile265).327 Many of these side chains are at the active-site binding interface, and not surprisingly, S2axis increases in the ternary E:pyruvate: AcCoA complex327 (Figure 18). This is partially compensated by small decreases in S2axis values for other methyl sites (Figure 18), although calculations suggest an overall loss of

53 J mol-1 K-1 in entropy from the free enzyme.327 Comparisons of the µs-ms time-scale motions in the free and ternary enzymes are not available, but backbone (15N) and side-chain (13C) R2 relaxation dispersion studies on the apoenzyme have also indicated that the binding pocket is flexible on this slower time scale.331 Rex contributions were observed throughout the enzyme, with the most significant conformational exchange occurring in the core and R/β domains, and the smallest µs-ms time-scale motions in the C-terminal domain and the N-terminal clasp331 (Figure 18). This is intriguing in light of the fact that the relative orientation of the domains does not change upon ligand binding, in contrast to what is observed in structurally and functionally similar enzymes.328,332 Transient sampling of higher energy conformations and/or altered protein dynamics may perform the same functional role in MSG as gross structural changes, required for substrate binding and/or product release, do in related enzymes.
TROSY methods have also been applied to integral membrane proteins.323,325,326 In particular, the solution structure and dynamics of the bacterial outer membrane enzyme PagP, which transfers a palmitate chain from a phospholipid to lipid A, have been studied in micelles (50-60 kDa).326 The core of the protein consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel with an amphipathic helix and disordered solvent exposed loops326 (Figure 19). The loops are exceptionally mobile on the ps-ns time scale, as evidenced by increased R1 values (Figure 19).326 15N R2 relaxation dispersion experiments also indicate that the loops, especially the large L1 loop connecting strands A and B, experience µsms time-scale motions333 (Figure 19). When the temperature is lowered, new HSQC peaks appear and directly confirm the presence of a minor conformer.333 The higher energy conformation may be important in substrate access or ligand regress, as discussed above for other enzymes.
The largest enzyme that has been studied by NMR is the 300-kDa cylindrical protease ClpP.65 ClpP functions as a double heptamer with the catalytic sites located in the interior (Figure 20). Proteins marked for degradation are unfolded and threaded through the axial pores by the chaperones ClpX and ClpA.334-336 However, the path by which products escape was not previously known. 13C methyl R2 relaxation dispersion experiments indicated that the side chains of Ile149 and

All residues displayed the same temperature dependence, from which an activation enthalpy and entropy of 13.1 kcal/mol and -3.6 cal mol-1 K-1, respectively, were derived.65 Ile149 and Ile151 are located at the interface between the two heptamer rings of ClpP, and it was suggested the observed µs-ms time-scale motions are involved in product release65 (Figure 20). To test this mechanism, disulfide bridges were introduced to bond the two rings together. Under reducing conditions, ClpP is functional, but under oxidizing conditions, activity is completely abrogated, even though peptide is retained by the enzyme.65 These results suggest that the higher energy conformer supplies an escape route for the degradation products without interfering with further substrate entrance, directly connecting protein dynamics to product release in ClpP.
Many enzymes are multidomain proteins composed of both regulatory and catalytic subunits. We have outlined how protein dynamics can affect events throughout the catalytic cycle, including substrate binding, chemical transformation, and product release. Considering the importance of protein dynamics to enzyme function, regulatory units may affect catalytic subunits not only structurally but also dynamically. Communication and interactions in multi-enzyme complexes (e.g. “substrate channeling”) are also critically dependent on motion.337,338 TROSY techniques, together with “isotopic segmental labeling” that can both reduce spectral complexity and provide focus on the protein domain of interest,339-342 promise to make studies of the dynamics of these complex enzyme systems tractable by NMR.
4. Conclusions
NMR relaxation techniques have been used to study multiple time-scale dynamics of enzymes in different phases of the catalytic cycle. These studies suggest that protein motion plays important roles in all aspects of catalysis. Catalysis and ligand exchange generally occur on the µsms time scale that corresponds to the time domain of protein conformational change, suggesting that conformational change

is intimately related to these enzymatic events. This has generally been taken as support for the “induced-fit” hypothesis; ligand binds to one conformation, and this interaction pushes the enzyme into an alternative conformation that forms more favorable interactions with the ligand.343 However, for this process to occur, the ligand must have some affinity for the initially encountered protein conformation, and it is not always apparent from apoenzyme structures how this might transpire. This is underscored by, for example, ligand binding to the cavity mutant of T4 lysozyme, where it is not at all clear how the ligand would form an initial favorable complex with the enzyme. Whereas the induced-fit mechanism assumes conformational homogeneity, conformational selection takes account of the fact that proteins may adopt an ensemble of conformations; i.e., they are heterogeneous in conformation.83,223-229 Thus, an enzyme may consist of a major conformer, comprising >90% of the molecules in the ensemble, yet it is one of the minor conformers that interacts with the ligand (Figure 9). Ligand binding then decreases ∆G for the complex, and the bound conformation becomes more highly populated in the ensemble. This implies that the enzyme exists as an ensemble of interconverting conformational states and that ligand binding merely changes the conformational equilibrium.228
Substrate binding, product release, and chemical transformation can all affect the conformational equilibrium.83 RNase A, for example, can exist in solution in at least two conformations, representing the free and bound forms of the enzyme.206,230 Substrate can bind to a protein conformation resembling the lowest energy conformation of the bound form, and product may be released from a higher energy conformation that is structurally similar to the lowest energy conformation of the free form. Similar processes are apparent in adenylate kinase (AK) where the product release rate constant corresponds to the rate constant for the lower-tohigher energy conformational transition determined by R2 relaxation dispersion.204 The model Michaelis complex for DHFR (E:NADP+:folate) is also in conformational equilibrium between a “closed” substrate conformation and a product “occluded” conformation.205 Our unpublished results suggest analogous processes are occurring throughout the catalytic cycle of DHFR.

An NMR Perspective on Enzyme Dynamics
Figure 21. Energy landscape of dihydrofolate reductase in the Michaelis model complex E:NADP+:folate. (A) The ground-state conformation of E:NADP+:folate is closed. Within the closed ground state, side chain coupling constant measurements reveal the existence of two substates that differ in the rotamer populations of certain aliphatic side chains. R2 relaxation dispersion experiments have also identified a higher energy occluded conformation. (B) Dynamic energy landscape of DHFR. The ground-state conformation of the Michaelis complex (E:DHF:NADPH) is closed. Following the chemical step, the energy landscape changes: the closed state in which hydride transfer occurs is now a higher energy state of the E:THF:NADP+ product, which relaxes rapidly to the new occluded ground state. Panel B is reproduced with permission from ref 205. Copyright 2005 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.
Enzymes thus represent dynamic energy landscapes.83 The binding of substrate, release of products, and substrate-toproduct conversion will affect the relative energies of the various substates. The energy landscape shifts in response to the presence of ligands, and these shifts, in turn, guide the enzyme further along its catalytic cycle.83 Mutations or allosteric inhibitors affecting the energy landscape will thus generally have a detrimental impact on catalysis.175,344
Larger barrier heights lead to longer time-scale motions. The ps-ns time-scale motions reflect crossing of the smaller barriers and are determined by the “ruggedness” of the energy landscape. Slower time-scale motions can be attributed to larger barriers and represent “true” conformational transitions between substates. In RNaseHI, the barriers in the energy landscape for the thermophilic enzyme are larger, and hence, motions are reduced on the ps-ns time scale but are increased on the µs-ms time scale compared to the case of the mesophilic protein.317 In DHFR, the energy landscape for the E:NADP+:folate complex consists of the ps-ns timescale ruggedness, the trans-gauche rotameric substates in the closed conformation, and a higher energy occluded conformation (Figure 21). The rotameric substates in DHFR may be important for transition-state stabilization. Following hydride transfer, the now higher-energy closed conformation must then collapse into a lower-energy occluded conformation in the E:THF:NADP+ product complex.
The results from NMR studies may hide even further complexity. NMR is an ensemble technique, and the observed higher energy conformations may themselves give

a time-averaged view of the energy landscape. Single molecule studies have shown that individual enzymes do not perform catalysis at identical rates, and turnover fluctuates even in the same enzyme molecule.345-353 The individual enzymes may be following different paths through the dynamic energy landscape, analogous to following different folding paths to the same globular structure, that are governed by Boltzmann probability and individual kinetic energies. This view also suggests that there is not a single transition state relevant to chemical transformation but that there are multiple paths to product. This scheme is much more complicated than the traditional one-dimensional reaction coordinate, but as discussed, this provides a framework for understanding diverse topics such as ligand exchange, allostery, protein stability in mesophiles/thermophiles, enthalpyentropy compensation, and kinetic heterogeneity.
It is now clear that we are moving past a static view of proteins and enzyme catalysis. NMR will undoubtedly continue to provide fundamental insight into enzyme dynamics and provide the necessary experimental evidence to test theories of catalysis.
