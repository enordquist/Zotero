Abstract

Hsp70s use ATP hydrolysis to disrupt protein-protein associations and to move macromolecules. One example is the Hsc70- mediated disassembly of the clathrin coats that form on vesicles during endocytosis. Here, we exploited the exceptional features of these coats to test three models—Brownian ratchet, power-stroke and entropic pulling—proposed to explain how Hsp70s transform their substrates. Our data rule out the ratchet and power-stroke models and instead support a collision-pressure mechanism whereby collisions between clathrin-coat walls and Hsc70s drive coats apart. Collision pressure is the complement to the pulling force described in the entropic pulling model. We also found that self-association augments collision pressure, thereby allowing disassembly of clathrin lattices that have been predicted to be resistant to disassembly. These results illuminate how Hsp70s generate the forces that transform their substrates.

Hsp70s inhibit the formation of nonfunctional protein complexes and aggregates by sequestering interactive (primarily hydrophobic) segments of both native and misfolded protein substrates 1 , 2 . The conformational changes that allow Hsp70s to alternately bind and release their substrates are understood 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 but do not explain how Hsp70s disassociate aggregates or complexes 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , or pull proteins into organelles 12 , 13 . In these reactions, Hsp70s move their substrates, either through translocation pores or away from other proteins. Under the power-stroke model, Hsp70, during ATP hydrolysis, undergoes a conformational change that pulls on its substrate 12 . Under the Brownian ratchet model, Hsp70 asymmetrically traps spontaneous fluctuations that move the substrate in a particular direction 14 , 15 . Finally, under the entropic pulling model 16 , 17 , Hsp70 recruitment to its substrate results in an Hsp70 bound to a floppy polypeptide abutting a structural wall (for example, an aggregate or translocation pore). Movement of Hsp70 away from the wall, dragging the polypeptide substrate with it, is thermodynamically favored because it increases Hsp70's freedom of motion and entropy.

Clathrin uncoating, in which constitutively expressed Hsc70 is recruited to coated vesicles by the J cochaperone auxilin and then drives coat disassembly into triskelia (trimers of clathrin heavy- and light-chain dimers) 2 , provides an exceptional system through which to study how Hsp70s alter their substrates. Clathrin-cage assembly and disassembly in vitro 18 can be precisely monitored in both single-molecule 19 , 20 and ensemble experiments 21 . Cage stability can be modulated by pH 22 . Structures of cages and other reaction components have been reported 3 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , and a single Hsc70-binding site at the clathrin heavy-chain (CHC) C terminus mediates disassembly 27 .

We set out to test models of Hsp70 force generation by exploiting these features. Our results do not support the power-stroke or Brownian-ratchet models but instead support the entropic pulling model. They also show that Hsp70 oligomerization, a ubiquitous phenomenon with no known active biological function 28 , 29 , 30 , augments the force that Hsp70s generate when acting on their substrates.
Results
The three models in the context of uncoating

Clathrin-cage disassembly is driven by Hsc70 binding to a sequence (QLMLT) in the flexible CHC C-terminal tail ten residues downstream of each of the three helices at the center of the triskelion under each cage vertex 23 , 27 ( Fig. 1a,b ). In previous structural studies, it has been proposed that Hsc70 does not induce but instead sterically locks in fluctuations that loosen the clathrin lattice until they accumulate to a point that disassembly ensues 23 . This Brownian/steric-wedge model can be tested by moving the Hsc70-binding site to relieve steric clashes between the Hsc70 and cage walls. If disassembly were to persist even as steric clashes are relieved, this mechanism would be less plausible.

The entropic pulling model emphasizes thermodynamics—the entropy change—in the reaction 16 , 17 , but the complementary molecular kinetic description is collision pressure, in which collisions and repulsion between Hsp70s and closely apposed structural walls impart momentum away from the walls 31 , 32 and to the Hsp70s. Such collisions necessarily generate equal and opposite momentum on the walls. Thus, Hsc70s bound to flexible tethers under each vertex would impart pressure against cage walls and consequently drive the triskelia apart. In contrast to the steric-wedge model, the collision-pressure mechanism suggests that moving the Hsc70-binding site away from the walls would slow but not stop disassembly and that moving this site by 10 or 25 amino acids (aa) would slow disassembly by ∼ 10- or ∼ 60-fold, respectively 17 ( Supplementary Note 1 ).

The collision-pressure and Brownian/steric-wedge models predict that any protein similar in size to Hsc70 and binding at the same location should drive disassembly, whereas the power-stroke model requires an Hsc70-specific conformational change. Therefore, in contrast to the steric wedge and collision-pressure models, the power-stroke mechanism suggests that if the Hsc70-binding site were replaced with an antibody-binding site, the antibody should not drive disassembly.

To test the mutually exclusive predictions of these models, we assembled cages from CHCs in which the Hsc70-binding site was at its wild-type (WT) position (0 aa), or 10 or 25 aa C-terminal to this position (+10 aa and +25 aa; Fig. 1c ). We also prepared cages with this site replaced with an antibody-binding site (a FLAG tag) at the WT position, or 10 or 25 aa C-terminal to this position (denoted 0-aa FLAG, +10-aa FLAG and +25-aa FLAG; Fig. 1c ).
Moving the Hsc70-binding site slows disassembly

We measured disassembly on the basis of light-scattering in a stopped-flow fluorometer ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), using cages reacted with varying concentrations of Hsc70. With 0-aa cages, reaction profiles ( Fig. 2a ) were similar to those seen by Rothnie et al ., who have used a similar approach 21 . The reaction of cages with 2 μM Hsc70 resulted in an initial ∼ 15% increase in scattering, which was followed by a drop to ∼ 20% of the initial level. The large drop was due to disassembly 21 , 24 . The nature of the initial smaller increase is unknown but was assigned by Rothnie et al . to the binding of the first Hsc70 to one of the three CHC termini in their sequential mechanism, in which three Hsc70s must bind all three sites in a triskelion before that triskelion is released from the cage. A subsequent single-molecule study has cast doubt over this mechanism by showing that disassembly begins when only one or even fewer 20 Hsc70s are bound for every two triskelia, and that Hsc70s continue to bind and accelerate disassembly even after disassembly had begun 19 .

We attempted to fit our data by using the sequential scheme described Rothnie et al . but concluded that neither the amplitude of the initial increase in scattering nor the rates of this initial increase or subsequent decrease could be accurately determined, because these parameters are coupled ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). We therefore used the simplest possible scheme: C + H → CH → T, where C, H and T correspond to cages, Hsc70 and triskelia, respectively ( Supplementary Note 2 ) to fit values for the rate of Hsc70 association ( k a ), the amplitude of scattering from the intermediate (CH) and the cage-disassembly rate ( k d ). However, because these parameters are coupled, we did not ascribe meaning to these values but instead derived a parameter that was independent of the amplitude of the intermediate and incorporated both the association and disassembly rates: k ov = 1/(1/([Hsc70] × k a )+1/ k d )), in which square brackets denote concentration. This equation corresponds to the overall rate of disassembly ( k 3 + = 0.105 μM −1 s −1 ) described by Bocking et al . 19 . Bocking et al . have concluded that this rate increases linearly with Hsc70 concentration. However, this conclusion is inconsistent with their data, which show large divergence from linearity at Hsc70 concentrations >1 μM (ref. 19 ), and also with our data ( Fig. 2d–f ) and those from Rothnie et al . 21 , which show hyperbolic kinetics. We therefore fitted overall rates at different Hsc70 concentrations to a hyperbolic equation ( Fig. 2d ). With 0-aa cages, we obtained a V max of 0.11 s −1 with an [Hsc70] 1/2 V max of 0.34 μM, and a rate of 0.065 s −1 at 0.5 μM Hsc70, a result similar to the estimate of 0.053 s −1 with 0.5 μM Hsc70 (a concentration at which divergence from their linear model was small) in Bocking et al .

With +10-aa and +25-aa cages, disassembly was, respectively, two- and four-fold slower than with 0 aa cages ( Fig. 2 ). Disassembly of cages missing the Hsc70-binding site was ∼ 20× slower ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), thus indicating that disassembly of +10-aa or +25-aa cages was predominately due to Hsc70 binding to the displaced site. The initial scattering increase became larger as the Hsc70-binding site was moved, reaching ∼ 70% of the starting value in reactions with +25-aa cages ( Fig. 2c ).

Our observation that disassembly slowed by only four-fold even when the Hsc70-binding site was moved 25 aa does not support the Brownian/steric-wedge model but is also inconsistent with the collision-pressure model, which predicts an ∼ 60-fold decrease when the binding site is moved to this extent. We wondered whether this result might be due to Hsc70 self-association 28 , because the collision-pressure model assumes identical numbers of Hsc70s binding to cages with different tether lengths. We tested this possibility with Hsc70ΔC, which is functional in disassembly but bears a C-terminal deletion that decreases self-association 33 . With Hsc70ΔC and 0-aa cages, the maximal disassembly rate was approximately two-fold slower, and the 1/2 V max concentration was approximately two-fold greater than that with Hsc70 ( Fig. 2g ). However, with +10-aa and +25-aa cages, disassembly with Hsc70ΔC was much slower than with Hsc70 ( Fig. 2h,i ), and we were not able to determine V max because the rates did not plateau over the tested concentration range. Instead, we compared rates at 2 μM Hsc70ΔC and obtained values of 0.051 s −1 , 0.0078 s −1 and 0.00080s −1 for the 0-aa, +10-aa and +25-aa cages, respectively ( Fig. 2g–i and Supplementary Table 1 ). Thus, with Hsc70ΔC, the rate decreases were in agreement with the collision-pressure model. With Hsc70ΔC, the initial scattering increase was also smaller than that with Hsc70, reaching a maximum of ∼ 40% (with +25-aa cages; Fig. 2i ) but reaching ∼ 70% with Hsc70 ( Fig. 2c ).
Anti-FLAG Fabs disassemble FLAG-tag cages

To test the power-stroke model, we evaluated the ability of anti-FLAG Fab to disassemble FLAG-tag cages. We used Fab (50 kDa) rather than IgG because Fab is similar in molecular weight to Hsc70 (70 kDa) or Hsc70ΔC (60 kDa) and because divalent binding may cross-link CHCs and inhibit disassembly ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). When the tag was at the same position as the WT Hsc70-binding site, Fab disassembled cages at rates similar to those of Hsc70 or Hsc70ΔC ( Fig. 2j ). However, when the tag was moved 10 or 25 aa downstream ( Fig. 2k.l ), the rates slowed approximately 8- or 40-fold, respectively, similarly to our observations for Hsc70ΔC and in agreement with the collision-pressure model. The amplitude of the initial increase in scattering with Fab was also similar to that observed with Hsc70ΔC. However, the rate of this increase was faster, reaching completion within 1–2 s with Fab but extending over 5–25 s with Hsc70ΔC. This result probably reflects that Hsc70 must first bind ATP and then auxilin, and is then transferred to clathrin in a step limited by an ATP-hydrolysis rate of ∼ 0.1 s –1 (ref. 34 ). The rate of the initial increase with Fab indicates a binding rate of 1 × 10 6 to 2 × 10 6 M −1 s −1 , values consistent with known antibody binding rates 35 .
Hsc70 markedly increases scattering by low-pH-stabilized cages

As the Hsc70-binding site was shifted, disassembly slowed, and the initial scattering increase became larger ( Fig. 2a–c ). We propose that this occurs because when disassembly is fast, the potential amplitude of this increase is obscured because, before reaching its maximum, scattering drops as disassembly ensues. However, kinetic coupling ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) precludes estimation of its maximum amplitude by fitting rate data. To measure this amplitude, we carried out reactions at pH 6.0, at which cages resist disassembly 23 . With Hsc70, we observed an ATP- and auxilin-dependent increase in scattering of ∼ 200% of the starting value ( Fig. 3a–c ). With Fab ( Fig. 3d–f ) or Hsc70ΔC ( Fig. 3g,h ) the maximal increase was only ∼ 50% and ∼ 70%, respectively.

Light-scattering by a protein is a function of its dimensions and mass. To determine whether the initial increases in scattering were due to increases in cage mass, we adapted a hollow-sphere model developed to analyze scattering from vesicles 36 . For Hsc70ΔC and Fab, this model accurately predicted the amplitude of the scattering increases to be ∼ 70% and ∼ 55%, respectively, assuming that each of these proteins binds 1:1 to their binding sites in a cage ( Fig. 3i ). However, the model predicts a scattering increase of only ∼ 80% for binding of Hsc70 at the same stoichiometry, thus suggesting that Hsc70 induces a larger increase in cage dimensions than does Hsc70ΔC or Fab; that a larger number of Hsc70s bind; or that Hsc70 causes cages to aggregate. We ruled out the last possibility because we saw no change in either the rate or amplitude of the Hsc70-driven scattering increase in experiments in which the cage concentration was varied ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).
Scattering increases are not due to increases in cage size

If only one Hsc70 were to bind the single Hsc70 site in each CHC, cage diameters would have to increase ∼ 30% to explain the three-fold increase in scattering observed in reactions at pH 6 with Hsc70 ( Fig. 3a–c ). However, Xing et al . 23 have observed that Hsc70ΔC binding decreases cage dimensions by 0.8% along one axis and increases them by 1.4% along the other two axes. Because Hsc70 might drive larger changes in size than Hsc70ΔC, we performed cryo-EM reconstructions of pH-6.0 cages with or without Hsc70 or Hsc70ΔC 23 . Our reconstructions and difference maps were similar to those published previously 23 ( Fig. 4a,b ), and the density due to Hsc70ΔC was attributable to envelopes of similar volume under each cage vertex. With the isosurface representation contoured at 2.5 σ , a common value used for highly symmetric structures, this envelope could accommodate only a single ∼ 25-kDa protein-binding domain (PBD) ( Fig. 4d–f ), thus suggesting that much of the Hsc70ΔC density was averaged out as a result of dynamic or static disorder. Cages with Hsc70 were similar in size to cages alone or with Hsc70ΔC ( Fig. 4a–c ), a result indicating that size changes cannot explain the large scattering increases observed when Hsc70 binds. Difference maps between cages with and without Hsc70 revealed an element positioned similarly to the density ascribed to Hsc70ΔC in the Hsc70ΔC cages ( Fig. 4f ). However, although Hsc70 is only ∼ 16% larger than Hsc70ΔC, this density was more than two-fold larger with Hsc70 than with Hsc70ΔC, thus suggesting either reduced disorder or binding of a larger number of molecules with Hsc70 than with Hsc70ΔC.

Multiple Hsc70s bind each CHC in low-pH-stabilized cages

Because cage expansion, aggregation or binding of one Hsc70 to each CHC in a cage was unable to explain the Hsc70-induced scattering increases at pH 6, we determined whether multiple Hsc70s might be binding each CHC by reacting Hsc70, Hsc70ΔC or Fab with cages at pH 6 and then pelleting the cages and their associated proteins ( Fig. 5a,b ). In agreement with the observed scattering and our model predictions ( Fig. 3i ), approximately one Fab per CHC bound to cages at all concentrations tested ( Fig. 5d ), whereas ∼ 0.5, ∼ 0.8 and ∼ 2 Hsc70ΔCs were bound at 1, 3, and 9 μM, respectively ( Fig. 5c ). However, Hsc70 was bound in molar excess of CHC, with ∼ 10 Hsc70s per CHC at 9 μM Hsc70 ( Fig. 5c ). Binding of such a large number of Hsc70s was dependent on auxilin, ATP and, critically, the presence of an Hsc70-binding site in the CHC ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). We conclude that the large scattering increases observed when Hsc70 was reacted with pH-6.0 cages reflect multiple Hsc70s binding per CHC, probably as a result of Hsc70 self-association, because we did not observe the same results for Hsc70ΔC.

Hsc70 self-association augments its disassembly force

The collision-pressure mechanism predicts that decreasing the number of cage-bound Hsc70s would reduce the net force that they generate against cage walls and slow the rate of disassembly. To test this possibility, we used Hsp110, a nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF) for Hsp70 (ref. 37 ). Hsp110 accelerates disassembly at low Hsc70 concentrations by detaching Hsc70 from released triskelia, and Hsc70 then can cycle back to cages 38 . At 20 nM Hsc70, low Hsp110 levels enhanced disassembly, but higher levels resulted in less enhancement or modest inhibition together with a decrease in the initial scattering increase ( Fig. 6a ). With 250 nM Hsc70, increasing Hsp110 progressively decreased the initial scattering increase and slowed disassembly ( Fig. 6b ). Thus, when Hsc70 is limiting, Hsp110 accelerates disassembly by releasing Hsc70 from triskelia, but at higher Hsc70 concentrations, Hsp110 inhibits disassembly by also unloading Hsc70s from cages.

If decreasing the number of Hsc70s bound to cages decreases the forces driving disassembly, then self-association, by increasing the number of Hsc70s, should increase these forces. This possibility may explain why Hsc70 was more effective than Hsc70ΔC in disassembling +10-aa and +25-aa cages, whereas both disassembled 0-aa cages ( Fig. 2 ), and why we observed gradual decreases in scattering with 0-aa cages in pH-6 reactions with Hsc70 ( Fig. 3a ) but not Hsc70ΔC ( Fig. 3g ), thus suggesting that only Hsc70 slowly disassembles these cages. To test this possibility, we used higher Hsc70ΔC and Hsc70 concentrations to increase self-association. When we reacted pH-6 cages with 5–42 μM Hsc70ΔC, scattering doubled ( Fig. 6c ), consistently with the scattering model's predictions ( Fig. 3i ) and data demonstrating that, at these concentrations, approximately two Hsc70ΔCs bind per CHC ( Fig. 5c ). With Hsc70, scattering increased but then dropped ( Fig. 6d ), thus revealing disassembly. EM of pH-6 cages reacted with excess Hsc70 or Hsc70ΔC confirmed that cages were disassembled by Hsc70 but not Hsc70ΔC, and that Hsc70 formed oligomers in such reactions, whereas Hsc70ΔC did not ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Hsc70, but not Hsc70ΔC, therefore disassembles pH-6 cages, probably because of the greater self-association activity of Hsc70. The decreased disassembly by Hsc70ΔC compared with Hsc70 was not due to weaker binding, as shown by observations that Hsc70ΔC competed effectively with Hsc70 for binding to cages ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ). The collision-pressure mechanism also predicts that increasing Hsc70 bulk can increase its disassembly activity. To test this possibility, we compared disassembly by histidine-tagged Hsc70 with or without anti-histidine Fab. Addition of Fab 1:1 with histidine-tagged Hsc70 accelerated disassembly ( Fig. 6e ) but had no effect on disassembly by untagged Hsc70 ( Fig. 6f ).
Hsc70 makes cages rigid but prone to catastrophic deformation

The collision-pressure model's predictions for Hsc70's effects on cage compressibility may be understood by analogy to balloons inflated to high versus low pressure. Just as gas-molecule collisions with a balloon's interior generate outwardly directed forces, bound Hsc70s may generate such forces on the interior walls of the cage. Cages with Hsc70s should therefore be less compressible than Hsc70-free cages when probed with a low force, just as high-pressure balloons are less compressible than low-pressure balloons ( Fig. 7a ). However, a high-pressure balloon is more prone to bursting—undergoing catastrophic deformation—when it is probed with a strong force, whereas a low-pressure balloon deforms rather than bursting ( Fig. 7a ). To test this possibility, we used AFM to measure the sizes and mean and maximum deformations of cages, cages with auxilin, and cages with auxilin and either Hsc70ΔC or Hsc70, at pH 6.0. In agreement with our cryo-EM data, the sizes of all of these were similar ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ; Supplementary Table 2 ). With a 100-pN tip force, Hsc70 decreased the mean compressibility from 7.6 ± 0.16 to 6.3 ± 0.16 nm ( Fig. 7b ), but with a 200-pN force, Hsc70 increased the compressibility from 8.9 ± 0.18 to 11.9 ± 0.32 nm ( Fig. 7c ). Whereas the distribution of deformations was approximately Gaussian without Hsc70, the addition of Hsc70 led to a non-Gaussian distribution and appearance of a population of large (>15 nm) deformations ( Fig. 7c ), thus indicating that catastrophic deformation events were more frequent with Hsc70. To test this possibility, we measured the maximum deformation for each cage at a 100-pN force. Without Hsc70, 8% of cages exhibited maximum deformations of >30 nm, with a mean of 46 ± 2.5 nm, but with Hsc70, 30% of the cages exhibited deformations >30 nm, with a mean of 66 ± 1.5 nm ( Fig. 7d ). With the smaller (<30 nm) deformations, Hsc70 had the opposite effect: the mean maximum deformations for this group were 15 ± 0.36 nm and 17 ± 0.33 nm with and without Hsc70, respectively. The effect of Hsc70 was therefore consistent with collision-pressure predictions: Hsc70 made cages less compressible when they were probed at low force but markedly increased the frequency of catastrophic deformations.

( a ) Collision-pressure model analogizes cages either alone or with Hsc70 to balloons inflated to low and high pressure, respectively. Internal pressure generated by Hsc70s makes cages less deformable but more prone to catastrophic deformation (bursting) especially as the probing force is increased. ( b ) Percentages of cages with or without Hsc70 exhibiting the indicated mean compressions with 100-pN force. (The mean compression for each cage was determined from 9–12 measurements obtained from probing each cage on a 3 × 3 or 4 × 4 grid, depending on cage size.) ( c ) As in b , but with a 200-pN tip force. ( d ) Percentages of cages exhibiting the indicated maximum compressions during probing. Average maximum compressions for cage populations with maximum compressions <30 nm or >30 nM are shown (statistics in Supplementary Table 2 ). Source data for the graphs are available online.

Discussion

Support for a power stroke has rested, in part, on the conclusion that a Brownian ratchet cannot generate the force necessary to unfold the proteins that Hsp70s pull through translocation pores 12 . This conclusion was undermined by evidence that J proteins deposit Hsp70s on translocating substrates but then disengage, thus leaving the Hsp70 without a platform against which to push during the pulling 15 , 39 . Our observations that Fab binding at the same position as Hsc70 causes disassembly, and that Fab bound to Hsc70 enhances Hsc70's disassembly activity, further fail to support a power stroke and instead favor a mechanism in which the mass/volume ratio of a protein at this position causes disassembly. These results support either the collision-pressure or the Brownian/steric-wedge mechanism. However, the latter is not supported by the observation that disassembly persists even if Hsc70 is displaced by 25 aa, a distance that should relieve any direct steric clashes. By the process of elimination, collision pressure is the sole viable mechanism. But there is also evidence supporting this mechanism, which predicts that interposition of 10 or 25 residues between Hsp70 and a wall should slow disassembly ∼ 10- and ∼ 60-fold, respectively ( Supplementary Note 1 ), in agreement with decreases observed with Hsc70ΔC or Fab. Our observation that Hsc70 makes cages more rigid but more likely to experience catastrophic deformations also supports this model. In addition, although our gel analyses and scattering data indicate that approximately two Hsc70ΔCs and multiple Hsc70s (per CHC) bind cages under conditions similar to those used for cryo-EM, the volume under the vertex attributable to the chaperones in the reconstructions accommodates only one or two PBDs for Hsc70ΔC or Hsc70, respectively. It is unlikely this scenario reflects most of the Hsc70s binding elsewhere on the cages, because binding of multiple Hsc70s requires an Hsc70-binding site in the CHC C termini ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Density for most of the Hsc70s is therefore probably averaged out as a result of static or dynamic disorder, consistently with Hsc70s being mobile and able to exert collision pressure on cage walls.

The maximum calculated Hsp70 entropic pulling/pushing force of ∼ 20 pN (refs. 16 , 17 ) may be compared with experimentally measured osmotic pressures of concentrated protein solutions, because osmotic pressure is the macroscopic product of microscopic collisions between proteins and membranes 31 , 32 : a 450 mg/ml solution of 67-kDa albumin generates 0.5 pN/nm 2 of osmotic pressure at pH 7.4 (ref. 40 ). If Hsc70 generates similar pressures, then an Hsc70 bound to the CHC tail under a cage vertex could generate a pushing force of ∼ 20 pN ( Supplementary Note 1 ). By comparison, the kinesin power stroke generates 5 pN (ref. 41 ) with a step size of 8 nm (ref. 42 ), whereas the force generated by an Hsp70 drops precipitously as it moves 1–2 nanometers away from a wall 16 , 17 . The work done by these systems is therefore similar, but the force mechanism is appropriately adapted to the function of each.

Whereas anti-FLAG Fabs disassemble FLAG-tag cages, they differ from Hsc70 in that they cannot actively cycle from released triskelia to cages. Auxilin loads Hsc70 on cages in preference to triskelia both because cages present a higher density and/or better positioning of binding sites for the multiple clathrin-binding motifs on the auxilin molecule 43 and because cage architecture places auxilin closer to Hsc70-binding sites 23 , 44 . Hsp110, the NEF in this system, stimulates disassembly when Hsc70 is limiting ( Fig. 6a ) by unloading Hsc70 from triskelia 38 , but when Hsc70 is not limiting, high concentrations of Hsp110 inhibit disassembly by also unloading Hsc70 from cages ( Fig. 6b ). Similarly, Hsp70-mediated protein-disaggregation reactions are usually optimally stimulated by low Hsp110 concentrations 9 , 45 , 46 , an observation that may be explained by invoking the role of geometry in the entropic pulling/pushing model. In this model, the role of the J cochaperone is not simply to load the Hsp70 onto substrate but to load it onto substrate at an optimal position: close to a wall, where entropic pulling/pushing forces are greatest ( Fig. 8 , step 1). Collisions and repulsion between the wall and Hsp70 push the two apart, but, as predicted by the entropic pulling/pushing model and validated by our observations of the effects of shifting the Hsc70-binding sites in the clathrin cage, these pushing forces diminish with distance ( Fig. 8 , step 2). The reaction may stall if this distal Hsp70 sterically blocks loading of another Hsp70 at the more forcefully productive position, near the wall. The role of the NEF in the cycle is to unload the Hsp70 from the nonproductive position (step 3), but high NEF concentrations can be inhibitory if they also begin to unload Hsp70s from productive positions. In addition, if the substrate is recalcitrant and does not yield to the force of single Hsp70s (for example, clathrin cages at pH 6 versus pH 6.8), then the Hsp70 will remain close to the J cochaperone, thus allowing the latter to exploit the self-association properties of the chaperone to load additional Hsp70s onto the first and augment the forces (step 1b). Although this model does not suggest that Hsp110 cannot contribute to disaggregation via other mechanisms 47 , it can account for the observed Hsp110 concentration dependence and can explain how the established functions of J cochaperones and NEFs in loading and unloading of substrates, respectively, in the Hsp70 chemical cycle, are harnessed in a mechanical cycle that generates the forces by which Hsp70s move and transform their substrates.
Figure 8: General model for the Hsp70 mechanochemical cycle.
figure 8

Step 1: J cochaperone loads Hsp70 (70) on substrate, close to a structural wall, where entropic pulling or pushing forces are strongest. Step 2: collisions and repulsion between Hsp70 and the wall push Hsp70 and the associated substrate away from the wall, but with increasing distance, the repulsive interactions, frequency of collisions and force diminish, so that movement stalls (the force ( F ) versus distance ( d ) exponential-decay curve is adapted from ref. 17 ). Step 3: a NEF unloads Hsp70 from the stalled position, thus allowing J to again load an Hsp70 close to the wall so that the cycle can continue. Step 1b: if the substrate does not yield to the force exerted by a single Hsp70, then the Hsp70 persists near the J cochaperone, thus allowing loading of additional Hsp70s onto the first and augmenting the force generated.

Methods
DNA constructs.

DNA encoding rat clathrin heavy chain 1 (CHC) was PCR-amplified from DNA obtained from the Kirchhausen laboratory 19 with primer pair 1/2, and cloned into pET28a+ (Novagen). The +10-aa and +25-aa CHC DNAs were constructed by deleting nucleotides encoding the QLMLT sequence by using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). This was accomplished through amplification with primer pair 3/4, then re-addition of the QLMLT coding sequence 10 or 25 aa downstream by using primer pairs 5/6 and 7/8, respectively. CHC FLAG, +10-aa FLAG and +25-aa FLAG DNAs were constructed by replacing the sequence encoding QLMLT in CHC, CHC +10 aa and CHC +25 aa with a sequence encoding DYKDDDDK (FLAG tag), by using primer pairs 9/10, 11/12 and 13/14, respectively (primer sequences in Supplementary Data Set 1 ). DNA encoding clathrin light chain A1 (CLCA1) was amplified from pPPA1-2 rat LCA1 with primer pair 15/16 and cloned into pBAT4 (EMBL).
Protein expression and purification.

BL21(DE3) cells (Agilent) with plasmid encoding histidine-tagged CHC were grown to an OD 600 of 1.0 at 30 °C in 2× YT, transferred to 12 °C, induced with IPTG to 1 mM and incubated for 24 h. Cells from 1 L culture were pelleted and resuspended in 50 mL 0.5M Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mM β-ME (lysis buffer) with one Roche protease-inhibitor-cocktail tablet. Cells were lysed by sonication and the addition of 2.5 mL 20% Triton X-100 and were centrifuged at 125,000 g for 30 min. Supernatants were loaded onto 20 mL of Ni–NTA agarose (Qiagen), washed with 200 mL lysis buffer and eluted with 100 mL of 0.4 M Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM β-ME and 200 mM imidazole. Protein was precipitated with an equal volume of saturated (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and fractionated on a Superpose 6 (GE Healthcare) column in 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA and 3 mM DTT (storage buffer). Pure proteins were concentrated by NH 4 SO 4 precipitation, dialyzed into storage buffer, flash frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at −80 °C. CLCA1 was coexpressed with histidine-tagged CHC, because expression of CLCA1 alone led to its degradation, and was purified by Ni–NTA agarose as described above. Copurified proteins were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min to precipitate CHC, which was removed by centrifugation. Pure CHC and CLCA1 were mixed 1:1 for use in subsequent experiments. Hsc70 and auxilin(547–910) were prepared as previously described 38 . Anti-FLAG Fab was obtained by digestion of anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma; cat. no. F-1804; lot SLBG5673V) with a mouse IgG1 Fab preparation kit (Thermo). Validation of this monoclonal antibody is provided in ref. 49 . For the experiments using anti-histidine Fab, clathrin was purified from clathrin-coated vesicles 24 from bovine brains obtained from a commercial slaughterhouse, auxilin(547–910) was prepared by thrombin cleavage of GST-auxilin(547–910) 25 , and bovine Hsc70 with an N-terminal decahistidine tag was used so that Hsc70 would be the only histidine-tagged protein in the reaction. Anti-histidine Fab was obtained by digestion of anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (Miltenyi cat. no. 130-095-212; antibody GG11-8F3.5.1) with a mouse IgG1 Fab preparation kit (Thermo). Validation of this antibody is provided on the manufacturer's website.
Clathrin polymerization.

CHC and CLCA1 were mixed 1:1 at 4.5 μM in storage buffer and dialyzed against 100 mM MES, pH 6.2, 1.5 mM MgAc 2 and 2 mM DTT (polymerization buffer) for 7 h, then dialyzed overnight against 20 mM imidazole, pH 6.8, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgAc 2 and 2 mM DTT, or 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM DTT (DTT was omitted from all experiments with Fab). After dialysis, the sample was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 10 min to remove aggregated material. EM of cages revealed that cages prepared from recombinant clathrin were indistinguishable from those prepared with clathrin purified from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles (data available upon request).
Stoichiometry of protein binding to cages.

Cages polymerized as described above were dialyzed overnight against 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM KPO 4 and 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4, diluted to 0.15 μM CHC and mixed with 0.23 μM histidine-Aux(547–910), 0.5 mM ATP and the indicated concentrations of Hsc70, Hsc70ΔC or anti-FLAG Fab. Reactions (200 μl) were centrifuged at 400,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet cages and associated proteins. Pellets were suspended in 75 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer and resolved by denaturing PAGE. Proteins were imaged with a Bio-Rad Criterion Stain Free Imager and quantified with Bio-Rad Image Lab 2.0 software by comparison to lanes in which defined amounts of each protein were loaded. Experiments in which cages were omitted were run side by side to determine the background pelleting of each protein in the absence of cages. Uncropped images of gels in Figure 5 are presented in Supplementary Data Set 2 .
Stopped-flow experiments.

Light-scattering experiments were carried out in an Applied Photosystems stopped-flow fluorometer with excitation/emission wavelengths of 395 nm. Cages corresponding to 0.3 μM CHC (unless otherwise indicated in figure legends) with 1 mM ATP and 0.45 μM auxilin in 20 mM imidazole, pH 6.8, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 25 mM KCl and 2 mM MgAc 2 or 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 25 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 were reacted with an equal volume of 0.04 μM to 8 μM Hsc70 in the same buffer. Background scattering determined from reactions without cages was subtracted from measured scattering values, which were normalized by dividing by the starting scattering value so that the initial scattering in all reactions was 1.0. Measures of scattering by varying concentrations of cages or triskelia showed that scattering was linear with cage or triskelia concentrations over the ranges used in these experiments ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). As indicated in the figure legends, auxilin and/or ATP were omitted from some reactions to control for the effects of these molecules. Removal of ATP (or substitution with ADP or ATP-γS), auxilin, the Hsc70 NBD, or Hsc70 ATP binding or hydrolysis activity severely slowed or abrogated disassembly ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ).
Atomic force and electron microscopy.

QNM peak-force AFM experiments were carried out on a multimode 8-nanoscope V instrument (Bruker) under pH-6.0 buffer, with an MSCT cantilever with a calibrated spring constant designed between 0.01 and 0.03 N/m and peak-force set points of 100–200 pN; 5-μl drops of fresh cages with or without auxilin, ATP, and Hsc70 or Hsc70ΔC were deposited on freshly peeled mica and imaged under the same buffer after routine optimization for biological AFM. Data were analyzed with instrument software (Nanoscope ver8.15, Bruker) and exported as ascii files for further analysis with Excel (Microsoft) and displayed with ImageJ (version 1.4x, NIH). Samples as described for AFM were absorbed for 20 s to a Formvar-carbon grid, rinsed and incubated 20 s with 1% uranyl acetate. Grids were wicked, air-dried and examined at 25,000× magnification in a JEOL JEM 1200EX-II.
Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions.

CHC and CLCA1 were mixed 1:1 at 4.5 μM in storage buffer, the clathrin-assembly domain of AP180 was added at 4.5 μM (GST-C58) 50 , and the samples were dialyzed against 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 10 mM (NH 4 )SO 4 , 25 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM DTT. After dialysis, the sample was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 10 min to remove aggregates. Cages were then incubated with 1 mM ATP, auxilin (1.3:1 molar ratio to CHC) and either Hsc70ΔC or Hsc70 (at a 10:1 molar ratio to CHC), and aliquots of each sample were applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil R 1.2/R 1.3 300 mesh grids) containing an additional continuous thin layer of carbon, blotted and frozen in liquid ethane. Images were acquired under minimal dose conditions with an FEI Tecnai G2 FEG200 electron microscope at 200 kV with a Gatan side-entry cryo-holder at a nominal magnification of 41000× and underfocus values from 2 to 8 μm with a 16-megapixel FEI Eagle CCD camera with a step size of 15 um; thus, the pixel size of the acquired images was 3.65 Å (representative images of the cages are shown in Supplementary Data Set 3 ). The contrast transfer function of each image was estimated with CTFFIND3 (ref. 51 ). Single particles were manually selected and extracted with XMIPP3 (ref. 52 ). Particles were classified with a free-pattern maximum-likelihood method (Relion 2D-classification) 53 . To evaluate the structural homogeneity of the different data sets, Relion 3D classifications were performed 54 , and the D6 particles were selected and used for the 3D reconstruction with projection matching from XMIPP 55 . A total of 3,468, 5,609 and 4,891 particles were used for the 3D reconstruction of cages, cages + Hsc70ΔC and cages + Hsc70, respectively. The resolutions obtained for the 3D reconstruction of the cages, cages + Hsc70ΔC and cages + Hsc70 were 28.5 Å, 28.5 Å and 28.7 Å, respectively 56 . For the subtraction maps, the volumes used were first normalized and filtered to the same resolution (30 Å), then scaled to approximately the same dimensions and finally subtracted with the 'vop subtract' option in the Chimera package 57 . The same procedure was used to subtract the clathrin D6 coat with Hsc70 and auxilin (EMD- 5118 (ref. 23 )) from the clathrin D6 coat (EMD- 5119 (ref. 44 )), as shown in Figure 4a,d . Chimera was also used for the visualization of the volumes and docking of the atomic structures.
Data fitting.

We followed Rothnie et al . 21 and used Dynafit—which fits reaction schemes as sets of simultaneous differential equations—to fit our light-scattering data. In Dynafit scripts, a question mark after a parameter value indicates that the value is to be varied during fitting. The sequential aspect of the scheme used by Rothnie et al . 21 to globally fit their data is expressed by having three steps for Hsc70–ATP binding to cages and three steps for the transformation of Hsp70–ATP to Hsp70–ADP, corresponding to sequential loading of an Hsc70 onto each CHC in a triskelion. It also contains five global adjustable parameters ( k a and k d , corresponding to the bimolecular association rate for Hsc70 binding to cages and the monomolecular rate of cage disassembly, respectively; k r , corresponding to the rate of ATP hydrolysis; and scattering amplitudes for the starting (CA) and intermediate (CAT) species); and three locally adjustable parameters: an offset (the scattering value of the end state), and the concentrations of the clathrin cages (CA) and Hsc70 (T) for each data set with different Hsc70 concentrations (i.e., a total of 21 adjustable parameters for the example shown with data for six different Hsc70 concentrations: one cage and one Hsc70 concentration is fixed to anchor the fitting). We obtained good fits to our data with this script (Rothnie et al . fit, Supplementary Note 2 ), but it required cage and Hsc70 concentrations to vary as much as 2× from their experimentally input values and therefore seemed unreasonable. When concentrations were fixed as experimental inputs, the quality of the fits was poor, especially at lower Hsc70 concentrations. We therefore used a script (Simplefit, Supplementary Note 2 ) corresponding to the simplest scheme that could still capture our reaction profiles and fitted our averaged data individually at each Hsc70 concentration (all reactant concentrations were fixed as experimental inputs). It contains only three adjustable parameters (k a and k d , as defined above, and the amplitude of the scattering of the intermediate (CAT) species), and it was used simply to allow extraction of the global rate (1/(1/k a × [Hsc70] + 1/k d )) of the reaction at different Hsc70 concentrations, because determination of this global rate was robust, but the three adjustable parameters were too tightly coupled ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) to allow for confident determinations of their values. Global disassembly rates at different Hsc70, Hsc70ΔC or Fab concentrations were then fitted with a Hill equation with the cooperativity parameter set to 1.0 to extract the maximal (V max ) disassembly rate and the Hsc70/Hsc70ΔC/Fab concentration at which rates were half-maximal, as described in Results. In cases in which velocities did not plateau at the concentrations tested (for example, with Hsc70ΔC and +10-aa or +25-aa cages in Figure 2h,i , we compared velocities at the highest (2 μM) Hsc70ΔC concentrations used). With Fab and 0-aa FLAG cages, disassembly appeared to be incomplete, so fitting was also carried out by fixing final scattering to correspond to complete disassembly (20% of starting intensity), thus resulting in the smaller V max and [Fab] 1/2 V max values reported in Figure 2j . With Fab and +10-aa FLAG or +25-aa FLAG cages, the initial binding and subsequent disassembly phases were well separated, thus allowing the separate bimolecular association (k a ) and single-exponential-decay (disassembly) rates (k u ) to be individually fitted, as presented in Figure 2k,l (again, values were fitted by either allowing the final scattering intensity to vary or fixing it at 20% of the initial value, thus resulting in two values for each parameter).
Statistics.

The minimal number of experimental repetitions was set so that the s.d. ranges for experimentally determined values (that were concluded to differ) were nonoverlapping, though in almost all cases the number of repeats (as specified in individual figure legends or Supplementary Table 3 ) exceeded the minimal number by several fold. A small number (<5%) of data from experimental replicates were excluded when the experimental outcome (for example, value of a rate determination) differed by >2.5 s.d. from the mean of experiments carried out under ostensibly identical conditions and when a reason for the variation (for example, bubbles in the stopped-flow apparatus or the aging of labile reagents) was clear.

Supplementary Figure 1 Standardization, specificity and controls for experiments measuring disassembly by light-scattering.

a: Standard curves for scattering by various concentrations of either clathrin cages (black squares) or triskelia (red circles) expressed as concentration of CHC. Error bars show +/- SD for 6 (cages) or 13 (triskelia) repetitions of one experiment each. Across the concentration ranges used in our experiments the amount of light scattering by either cages or triskelia is linear (R 2 for both fits >0.99). Panels b-e: Removal of auxilin, ATP, Hsc70 ATP binding or hydrolysis activity, or deletion of the Hsc70 NBD greatly slows or abrogates Hsc70 mediated cage disassembly . b: Blue trace shows a complete reaction with 2 μM Hsc70 as in fig. 2A . Black trace shows an identical reaction with ATP omitted. Red trace shows a reaction in which the Hsc70 was replaced with 2 μM PBD (missing the NBD). c. Blue trace as in b; black=auxilin omitted; red=ATP and auxilin omitted; c: Blue as in a; black=ATPγS replaces ATP; red= ADP replaces ATP. Experimental: All reactions in b-d were carried out on the same day with the same set of cages, with each reaction condition repeated 4-11 times (trace thickness corresponds to +S.E.). The blue trace is identical in all plots but data for different reaction conditions was plotted separately for clarity as the reaction profiles otherwise overlap. e: Blue trace is complete reaction with WT Hsc70; red trace is with Hsc70 mutant that cannot bind ATP (G201E/G202D; Morgan, J.R. et al. A role for an Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor in the regulation of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. J Neurosci 33, 8009 (2013)); black trace is for ATP hydrolysis deficient mutant (E175S; Jiang, J. et al. Structural basis of J cochaperone binding and regulation of Hsp70. Mol Cell 28, 422 (2007)). Trace thickness shows +/- s.e. for 8-15 repetitions of 1-3 independent experiments. Panels f, g: Rapid disassembly of cages in which the canonical Hsc70 binding site is moved is not due to Hsc70 binding at non-canonical sites . f: Light scattering vs. time plotted for disassembly reactions with 2 μM Hsc70 and either cages in which the Hsc70 binding site was moved by 25AA (red; average of 11 replicates with trace thickness giving +/- s.e.) or in which it was eliminated (black; average of 9 replicates with +25AA FLAG tag cages). g: As in f, but using 2 μM Hsc70ΔC (averages of 7 and 10 replicates, respectively). The residual Hsc70-mediated disassembly seen with cages in which the Hsc70 site is replaced with a FLAG-tag appears to be primarily due to Hsc70 binding weakly to other sites on the tails, as we found that complete deletion of the tails markedly slowed disassembly even further than simply removing the Hsc70 binding site by mutation (data not shown, available on request). h : Anti-FLAG Fabs can’t dissociate WT cages . WT cages reacted with 2 μM Hsc70 (black trace; 5 replicates averaged) or 2 μM Fab (red trace; 7 replicates averaged). i: Auxilin stabilizes clathrin cage against disassembly . +10AA FLAG-tag Clathrin cages with auxilin in 1.3x excess of CHC were reacted with anti-FLAG Fab as described in fig. 2K (black trace), or in the absence of auxilin (red trace). Effects on auxilin on cage stability and contributions to disassembly are difficult to parse as it also makes an essential contribution to disassembly by recruiting the Hsc70 to the cage. By using FLAG-tag cages and anti-FLAG Fab we can remove the recruitment contribution and measure just auxilin’s contribution to cage stability. It is seen that the Fab disassemble the FLAG-tag cages more slowly in the presence of auxilin than without it, indicating that auxilin binding stabilizes cages and makes them more resistant to disassembly.
Supplementary Figure 2 Tight coupling limits fitting of microscopic reaction parameters from ensemble experiments that measure disassembly by light-scattering.

A: Fit (magenta) of a reaction profile (blue) for one experiment using the ‘Simplefit’ script ( Supplementary Information ). The obtained values of the variables (k a =Hsc70 binding rate; k d =cage disassembly rate; A 1 =scattering amplitude of the transient Hsc70:cage complex) were used to calculate the overall rate of disassembly (k ov ) and the time to 50% reaction complete (t 1/2 ) according to the equation: k ov =1/(1/([Hsc70]*k a )+1/k d ). B: As in A, but k d was fixed at 2x the value in A. Note the large differences in k a and A 1 between panels A and B, but the very similar value for k ov and t 1/2 for both fits. While the fit in A is better, both fits are quite good. This is because a reaction characterized by “fast Hsc70 binding (k a ), slow disassembly (k d ) and a small scattering amplitude for the transient cage:Hsc70 complex (A1)” will generate a profile very similar to a “slow binding, fast disassembly, large transient scattering amplitude increase” reaction. In practice, we found that experimental variation was greater than the differences in the quality of fits shown above so that microscopic rate parameters like k a , k d or A 1 could not be accurately determined from such data. However, the k ov values were relatively insensitive to this coupling.
Supplementary Figure 3 Bivalent anti-FLAG antibodies are ineffective at disassembling FLAG-tag cages.

A. Light scattering vs. time in disassembly reactions with +0AA FLAG cages run as in fig. 2J but with the indicated concentrations of anti-FLAG IgG rather than Fab. Traces are averages from 7-9 repetitions. B: The same data as in A, but plotted with error bars giving +/- s.e. range for each experiment (error bars removed in A for clarity due to data overlap). C. Plot of the 1st 15 seconds of the reactions to better resolve the initial antibody binding step. Note that the amplitude of the scattering increase (~40%) is similar to that seen with Fab ( fig. 2J-K ), and is therefore consistent with bivalent binding of the antibody since monovalent binding would result in binding of similar numbers of Ab and Fab molecules and with a larger scattering increase for the former due to its larger MW. D: Gel analysis confirms that anti-FLAG IgG binds cages bivalently. Plot of IgG/CHC ratios vs. [IgG] (at 1, 3 and 9 μM; errors are +/- s.e. for n=3) shows that 0.45-0.65 IgG molecules per CHC bind to cages, while 0.8-1.2 Fab molecules per CHC are seen to bind in identical experiments shown in figure 5 .
Supplementary Figure 4 The large Hsc70-induced increase in scattering at pH 6.0 is not due to cage aggregation, because the amplitude and rate of the scattering increase is insensitive to cage concentration.

Hsc70 could induce large increases in scattering by causing cages to aggregate. Since aggregation would be at least a 2 nd -order reaction, its rate should be sensitive to cage concentration. A. Scattering vs. time in pH 6.0 disassembly reactions with [Hsc70] at 2 μM and clathrin cages at the indicated concentrations (expressed in molar concentration of CHC with data plotted representing averages +s.e. of 10, 19, 15 and 14 replicates at 38, 75, 150 and 300 nM, respectively) and with scattering normalized so that the starting level in the reaction with 150 nM cages is 1.0. B. Data from A replotted so that the starting level of scattering in all the reactions is normalized to 1.0.
Supplementary Figure 5 Binding of large numbers of Hsc70s per CHC in pH 6–stabilized cages requires ATP, auxilin and an Hsc70-binding site in the CHC tails.

Plot of the # of Hsc70s per CHC pelleting with cages in absence of ATP, auxilin or an Hsc70 binding site (FLAG-tag cages; error is +se for 2 analyses of one experiment). Residual Hsc70 binding to cages in which the Hsc70 binding site is replaced with a FLAG-tag appears to be primarily due to Hsc70 binding weakly to other sites on the tails, as we found that complete deletion of the tails reduced binding (as assessed by the amount of 70 that pellets with cages) even more (to a level not meaningfully different than seen in the absence of cages; data not shown, available on request) than does altering the Hsc70 binding site by mutation. The nature of the 'non-specific' sites at which 70's bind to such cages is unknown, but such binding is consistent with the known promiscuous binding specificity of Hsc70 and the conclusion (Bocking, T., Aguet, F., Harrison, S.C. & Kirchhausen, T. Single-molecule analysis of a molecular disassemblase reveals the mechanism of Hsc70-driven clathrin uncoating. Nat Struct Mol Biol 18, 295-301 (2011)), that, even with WT cages, approximately half of the Hsc70 molecules that associate with cages bind at 'non-specific' sites that are ineffective for disassembly.
Supplementary Figure 6 Hsc70ΔC competes for Hsc70 binding to cages and inhibits cage disassembly by Hsc70 at low pH.

Reduced disassembly activity and scattering increases with Hsc70ΔC vs. Hsc70 could be due to weaker binding of Hsc70ΔC to cages, rather than reduced self-association. If so then adding excess Hsc70ΔC to reactions with Hsc70 shouldn't inhibit disassembly by the latter since Hsc70ΔC shouldn't effectively compete with Hsc70 for cage binding. Conversely, if Hsc70ΔC and Hsc70 bind cages with similar affinity, but Hsc70ΔC doesn't disassemble as effectively once bound, then Hsc70ΔC should compete with and inhibit Hsc70 disassembly. To test this we carried out disassembly at pH 6.3 and 1 μM Hsc70, conditions under which disassembly is slow and depends on Hsc70 self-association. A . Cage disassembly reactions carried out at pH 6.3 with 1 μM Hsc70 and with 0 (black; average of 5 replicates), 3 μM (red; average of 8 replicates with trace thickness showing +/- se), or 9 μM (blue; average of 8 replicates) Hsc70ΔCterm. Hsc70ΔCterm at 3- and 9x excess over Hsc70 is observed to reduce disassembly rates by ~2x and ~4x, respectively. B . SDS PAGE analysis of pellet fractions of 1mM Hsc70, 0.23 μM Auxilin, 0.15 μM (lanes 1-6) or 0 μM (lanes 7-12) cages (concentrations of cages expressed as [CHC]) and with Hsc70ΔC at 1 (lanes 2, 8), 2 (lanes 3, 9), 4 (lanes 4, 10), 8 (lanes 5, 11) or 16 (lanes 6, 12) μM. Hsc70ΔC reduces the amount of Hsc70 that pellets with the cages. This experiment was independently performed 2x with similar results.
Supplementary Figure 7 Hsc70, but not Hsc70ΔC, disassembles cages and forms filamentous oligomers at pH 6.0.

Cages were mixed with ATP and either Hsc70ΔC or Hsc70 as described for cryo-EM, but then incubated for 30 minutes to allow disassembly to occur and then negatively stained for EM. In the Hsc70ΔC reaction, cages were still present against a background of excess Hsc70ΔC (panel A). In reactions with Hsc70 almost no cages could be seen (panel B), though clearly obvious triskelia were not visible because the spindly triskelia are likely obscured by Hsc70 molecules in 10-fold molar excess of CHC. Long Hsc70 oligomers were abundant (a higher magnification view of these is shown in panel C), with each unit of the oligomer estimated as large enough to accommodate 1-2 Hsc70 molecules. In panels A and B a model of a reconstructed cage is inset to provide a scale marker.
Supplementary Figure 8 AFM analysis of clathrin cages.

A. Left panel: QNM AFM at 4nm pixel resolution and 100 pN tip force of clathrin-auxilin cages and under buffer (pH 6.0) reveals characteristic polygonal surface structure. Top right panel: 3D height view of a field of clathrin-auxilin cages. Lower right panel: Nanoscale intra-cage compressibility profiles of the same field. The shared X-Y scale bar of 100 nm and Z-color bar representation are for the height (100 nm) and the compression (30 nm). The white threshold lines in the right panels demarcate 35 nm height level around each observed cage to identify cage tops for the computation of the observed maximal and mean compression for each cage. B. QNM AFM of fields of cages with the indicated associated proteins. The top panel plots cage height while the lower panel plots compression (shared Z scale of 100 and 50 nm for height & compression, respectively). Note the wide distribution of compression profiles in the +Hsc70 panel where cages display both very large and small compressions, while the distribution of compression sizes in the other panels is more uniform. C. Height distributions of cages with the indicated associated proteins (200 pN tip force). D. Left panel: Distribution of mean and maximum compression values for cages with the indicated proteins (200 pN tip force). Mean compression corresponds the average of the compression observed when each cage was sampled with either a 3x3 or 4x4 grid (9 or 16 measurements respectively, depending on cage size). Maximum compression corresponds to the largest compression measured during AFM probing of each cage.
