I. INTRODUCTION
Proteins are synthesized in cells by a stepwise process in which
amino acids are added, one by one, from the NH2-tennini of the
chains (Bishop et al., 1960; Dintzis, 1961; Canfield and Anfinsen,
1963; Naughton and Dintzis, 1962). The folding of such nascent
chains can occur spontaneously without the need for any additional
information beyond that contained in the amino acid sequence and
its surroundings; the same is true of “structureless” unaggregated
polypeptides produced by denaturation of native molecules. The
experimental evidence that supports this conclusion has been re-
viewed in some detail elsewhere (Epstein e t al., 1963; Anfinsen,
1966, 1973; Wetlaufer and Ristow, 1973). The term “protein fold-
ing” refers to the processes involved in the conversion of an
ensemble of newly synthesized (or denatured) polypeptide chain
conformations to the unique three-dimensional conformation of the

native protein. When present, disulfide bonds serve to stabilize the
native conformation by reducing the structural fluctuations of alter-
native (denatured) forms (Schellman, 1955; Flory, 1956; Scheraga,
1963). In some cases, it has been found that the attainment of the
final native conformation depends on the presence of specific
ligands, frequently metal ions or prosthetic groups (although with
many enzymes these may be the substrate molecules themselves).
The presence of ligands does not necessarily lead to a significantly
different conformation of the folded protein, but helps to stabilize
the native form (Schechter et al., 1969; Taniuchi et al., 1969). It is
currently believed that the three-dimensional structure of the native
protein in a given environment (solvent, pH, ionic strength, presence
of other components, temperature, etc.) is the one in which the
Gibbs free energy of the whole system is a minimum with respect to
all degrees of freedom, i.e., that the native conformation is deter-
mined by the various interatomic interactions and hence by the
amino acid sequence, in a given environment. Whether or not this
“local” minimum in the free energy hyperspace is the global one is
at present an unsettled question.
Since it seems quite reasonable, on the basis of the available
experimental data, to accept the hypothesis of spontaneous folding to
a unique structure, it is of interest to consider the way in which such
a conversion from “one” to “three” dimensions occurs, and the na-
ture and magnitude of the interactions necessary to determine a spe-
cific structure. It has been suggested (Levinthal, 1968) that the
structure of a native protein might occasionally represent a unique
metastable state, not necessarily the one of lowest free energy. Such
a view would require that the folding of the chain occur by means of
a specific pathway which could lead to the metastable state only by
following an ordered sequence of events. One suggestion (Phillips,
1967; Chantrenne, 1961; Dunnill, 1965, 1967) proposes that the
chain folds as it is synthesized from the NH,- to the COOH-terminus.
Both stereochemical considerations and experiments on protein fold-
ing in solution make these ideas unlikely. Despite the possible
presence of high energetic barriers between conformational states,
the conformational space seems to be sufficiently large for pathways
around these barriers to exist, enabling the flexible polypeptide
chain to attain its most stable conformation (Hantgan et al., 1974).
To be more precise, one should distinguish between proteins that
consist of a single chain and those containing more than one, non-
covalently bonded chain (subunits). In the former case, the amino
acid sequence is presumably such that no decrease in free energy

from intermolecular interactions is possible at low temperature, and
the protein is stable in a single-chain (folded) form. In other cases,
the amino acid sequence has evolved (to achieve a particular biologi-
cal advantage) so that favorable intermolecular interactions (in addi-
tion to the intramolecular ones) can decrease the free energy of the
system by forming multisubunit (folded) aggregates, and even larger
organized structures.’
Evidence is now accumulating to suggest that nearest-neighbor,
short-range interactions play the dominant role in determining the
conformational preferences of the backbones of the various amino
acids, but that next-nearest neighbor (medium-range) interactions
and, to a lesser extent, long-range interactions involving the rest of
the protein chain are required to provide the incremental free energy
to stabilize the backbone of the native structure (Scheraga, 1973b,
1974a,b). The basis for this view comes from helix-probability pro-
files of denatured proteins and their correlation with helical regions
in native proteins, from the ability to predict with some success the
location of helix, extended structures, and p-turns in native proteins,
from conformational energy calculations on short oligopeptides, and
from experiments on the folding of protein fragments and sets of
complementary protein fragments. In contrast, the conformations of
the side chains of a native protein may be influenced more by long-,
rather than by short-range, interactions, Thus, it is thought that
short-range interactions lead to one or more backbone nucleation
sites’ along the chain, where there is a tendency to form specific
structures resembling the native conformations; these various sites
acquire additional stability from medium-range interactions and are
’ It may be noted that even a single-chain protein can undergo a decrease in free
energy, for example, by heating to form an aggregated complex. Several possibilities
then exist. If the native protein is the more stable one at the lower temperature, the
denatured aggregate may either revert spontaneously to the native protein, or be
prevented from doing so by kinetic barriers, when the temperature is lowered. Alter-
natively, if the denatured aggregate is the more stable form at the lower temperature,
kinetic barriers could prevent the denaturation of the native protein at a low tempera-
ture. In any case, it is postulated that a reasonable amount of conformation space is
accessible in going from the newly synthesized chain to the folded, native structure,
without interference from intervening barriers, but that such barriers may exist to
prevent the conversion of the protein from the native to an aggregated denatured form
(conversion to an unaggregated denatured form upon heating is postulated to be
reversible when the temperature is lowered).
The term “nucleation site” is used here to designate a portion of the amino acid
sequence in which the “native format” or conformation can form, i.e., a region in
which a specific local backbone conformation has a tendency to form because of short-
and medium-range interactions. However, it becomes stabilized in the specific con-
