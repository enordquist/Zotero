SUMMARY
Efﬁcient targeting of Hsp70 chaperones to substrate proteins depends on J-domain cochaperones, which in synergism with substrates trigger ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70s and concomitant substrate trapping. We present the crystal structure of the J-domain of Escherichia coli DnaJ in complex with the E. coli Hsp70 DnaK. The J-domain interacts not only with DnaK’s nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) but also with its substrate-binding domain (SBD) and packs against the highly conserved interdomain linker. Mutational replacement of contacts between J-domain and SBD strongly reduces the ability of substrates to stimulate ATP hydrolysis in the presence of DnaJ and compromises viability at heat shock temperatures. Our data demonstrate that the J-domain and the substrate do not deliver completely independent signals for ATP hydrolysis, but the J-domain, in addition to its direct inﬂuence on Hsp70s catalytic center, makes Hsp70 more responsive for the hydrolysis-inducing signal of the substrate, resulting in efﬁcient substrate trapping.
INTRODUCTION
The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) constitute the central hub of the cellular protein quality surveillance network, assisting numerous protein-folding processes and cooperating with all major cellular chaperone systems (Mayer and Bukau, 2005). Processes involving Hsp70s include folding of newly synthesized polypeptides and their trafﬁcking across membranes; prevention of protein aggregation, solubilization of protein aggregates, and their subsequent refolding; assembly and disassembly of oligomeric protein structures; control of activity of many regulatory proteins; and protein degradation by the proteasome and autophagy (Kettern et al., 2010; Meimaridou et al., 2009). Not surprisingly, Hsp70s are linked to numerous diseases, notably cancer, neurodegeneration, and infections (Calderwood et al., 2006; Fontaine et al., 2016; Ghazaei, 2017; Mayer, 2005; Radons,

2016; Shonhai et al., 2011), and in recent years became a target for drug development (Zuiderweg et al., 2017).
The enormous versatility of Hsp70 chaperones relies on the transient interaction of their C-terminal substrate polypeptidebinding domain (SBD) with a short degenerative sequence motif found frequently in virtually all proteins (Ru€diger et al., 1997). This interaction is regulated through an intricate allosteric mechanism between their N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and their SBD, resulting in ultrahigh afﬁnity through a non-equilibrium binding mode (De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014; Mayer and Kityk, 2015; Zuiderweg et al., 2013). In the ATP-bound state, afﬁnity for polypeptides is low but peptide association and dissociation rates are high. Upon ATP hydrolysis, afﬁnity of polypeptides is increased 10- to 50-fold, while peptide association and dissociation rates are decreased 100- and more than 1,000-fold, respectively (Figure 1A). The structures of the ATP- and ADPbound conformations rationalized these differences (Figure 1B). Ultrahigh afﬁnity is achieved when polypeptides associate with high rates to the ATP-bound state and concomitant ATP hydrolysis traps the substrate protein by transition to the ADP-bound state with low substrate dissociation rates. However, the intrinsic ATP hydrolysis rate of Hsp70 is very low and requires timely stimulation by the substrate itself in synergism with J-domain proteins (JDPs) (Karzai and McMacken, 1996; Laufen et al., 1999). Although Hsp70s are paradigm chaperones, in the absence of JDPs, they generally fail in the most basic chaperone function: the prevention of protein aggregation. Thus, efﬁcient interaction of Hsp70s with substrates depends entirely on JDP co-chaperones, which act as targeting factors for Hsp70s.
The number of JDPs present in each cell has increased tremendously in the course of evolution (Kampinga and Craig, 2010). JDPs are multi-domain proteins that are divided in three classes according to their domain composition. All JDPs contain the name-giving J-domain, a helical hairpin structure of 70–75 residues, which is at the N terminus of class A and class B JDPs but can be anywhere in class C proteins. Class A JDPs share all domains of the prototypic Escherichia coli DnaJ: the N-terminal J-domain is followed by a glycine/phenylalanine (G/F)-rich ﬂexible region of $30 residues, two homologous b sandwich domains, with a Zn2+-ﬁnger domain inserted into the ﬁrst of the two, and a C-terminal dimerization domain. Class B JDPs contain all domains of class A proteins except for the Zn2+ ﬁnger. Class C JDPs only have the J-domain in common and can have a wide variety of other domains or functional

motifs. Class A and class B JDPs are considered general cochaperones that interact with unfolded, misfolded, or aggregated proteins and transfer them to Hsp70. Class C proteins are believed to be more speciﬁc for a small subset of substrates or are located at places like the ribosomal exit tunnel or translocation pores where polypeptides emerge to be bound by Hsp70. Genetic and biochemical data demonstrated that the J-domain is necessary and sufﬁcient for functional interaction with Hsp70s (Karzai and McMacken, 1996; Wall et al., 1994). Therefore, the J-domain-Hsp70 interaction is at the heart of the multitude of functions of Hsp70 systems.
Here, we present the crystal structure of the J-domain of E. coli DnaJ in complex with the ATP-bound open conformation of the E. coli Hsp70 DnaK. Our structure reveals the molecular mechanism for the synergistic action of J-domain and substrate in stimulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70 and trapping substrates.
RESULTS
Overcoming the Constrains of Transient J-DomainHsp70 Interactions To overcome the main obstacle to structural investigations of the J-domain-Hsp70 interaction, the transient nature of this interaction, we fused the ﬁrst 105 amino acids of DnaJ, comprising the J-domain and the G/F-rich region, via a three-residue linker to the N terminus of DnaK (further referred to as JD-DnaK) (Figure S1A). The unstructured 33-residue G/F-rich region (Szyperski et al., 1994) bridges more than 100 A˚ and allows the J-domain to reach any position in DnaK, since in the ATP-bound conformation, no part of DnaK is more than 60 A˚ away from its N terminus (Kityk et al., 2012). Furthermore, the J-domain and G/F-rich region are sufﬁcient to replace full-length DnaJ and its close homolog, CbpA, in E. coli, allowing the DdnaJ DcbpA strain to grow at 14.5C and 39.5C (Kelley and Georgopoulos, 1997), downregulate the heat shock response (Wall et al., 1995), and support

bacteriophage l replication (Wall et al., 1994). The J-domain in the chimeric protein stimulated ATPase activity 20 times more efﬁciently than equimolar concentrations of DnaJ(1–105) stimulate DnaKwt when added in trans, consistent with the expectation that the fusion construct provides J-domain function at a much higher local concentration (Figures S1B and S1C). Thus, the J-domain of JD-DnaK functionally interacts with the Hsp70 part of the fusion construct. Of note, full-length DnaJ, added at the high concentrations used in our quenchedﬂow single-turnover ATPase assays (10 mM), was able to stimulate DnaKwt to ATPase rates similar to those as observed for our JDDnaK construct. Because full-length DnaJ is known to mimic a substrate in the absence of other protein substrates, thereby providing the J-domain and a substrate signal for ATP hydrolysis (Laufen et al., 1999), our construct also might provide J-domain and substrate function, presumably through the G/F-rich linker. For crystallization, we introduced three additional modiﬁcations into JD-DnaK to stabilize the ATP state of the protein. First, we replaced Thr199 (DnaK numbering throughout) with alanine, which abrogates ATPase activity without affecting the allosteric mechanism (Barthel et al., 2001) (Figure S1A). Second, we covalently ﬁxed the a-helical lid of the SBD (SBDa) to the NBD via a disulﬁde bridge formed between cysteines introduced at positions 47 and 529, which stabilizes the physiologically relevant open conformation of DnaK (Kityk et al., 2012). Third, we replaced the last 30 residues of DnaK, known to be unstructured (Zhu et al., 1996), by 5 histidine residues. This construct, DnaJ(1–105)-DnaK(2–606)E47C,T199A,F529C-H5 (short JD-DnaKcryst), was oxidized to form a disulﬁde bridge and crystallized.
Overall Structure of the J-Domain-DnaK Complex Phases were obtained by molecular replacement using the structure of full-length DnaK (Kityk et al., 2012), residues 3–65 of the J-domain were built manually, and the complex reﬁned at 3.25 A˚ resolution (Table 1). The J-domain (3–65) and DnaK (2–604) are well deﬁned in the electron density, whereas no electron density was observed for the G/F region (Figures 1C and S1D). The structure of DnaK in the JD-DnaKcryst construct closely resembles the structure of DnaK$ATP solved previously (Kityk et al., 2012; Qi et al., 2013) with small changes close to the bound J-domain (Figures 2A and 2B). The DnaK part consists of the

NBD in complex with Mg2+-ATP and the SBD in the open conformation with a-helical lid (SBDa) and b sandwich domain (SBDb) separated from each other and docked onto the NBD. The highly conserved interdomain linker, which is important for ATP hydrolysis (Vogel et al., 2006b), is inserted into the lower crevice of the NBD. The J-domain consists of four a helices (I–IV) and is similar to the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures of DnaJ’s J-domain (Figure 2C). The J-domain binds to DnaK at the interface formed between NBD and SBDb (Figure 1C), and contacts formed between J-domain and DnaK, covering an interface area of 923 A˚ 2, are fully consistent with genetic, biochemical, and structural data available (Figures 2D and 2E), including a recent molecular modeling study (Malinverni et al., 2017).
Interactions of the J-Domain with the NBD and the Universally Conserved Linker The universally conserved HPD motif (His33-Pro34-Asp35), which is essential for stimulation of the ATPase activity in all

J-domain/Hsp70 pairs tested so far (Campbell et al., 1997; Kelley and Georgopoulos, 1997; Tsai and Douglas, 1996; Wall
et al., 1994), protrudes toward the interdomain linker of DnaK (Figure 1C). His33JD, Tyr25JD, and Met30JD form hydrophobic contacts with the linker residues Leu390DnaK and Leu392DnaK (Figure 3A). In addition, His33JD/NE2 is at hydrogen-bond distance to the backbone carbonyl of Leu391DnaK, Arg36JD/NH1 and NH2 form polar contacts with the backbone carbonyls of Lys387DnaK and Val389DnaK (Figure 3B), and Asp35JD/OD2 interacts with Arg167DnaK/NH1. Notably, Arg167DnaK, Leu390DnaK, and Leu392DnaK were previously suggested to be involved in DnaK-DnaJ interactions and Leu391DnaK in allostery in DnaK
(Kumar et al., 2011; Laufen et al., 1999; Mayer et al., 1999; Suh et al., 1998), and Tyr25JD and Arg36JD are important for DnaJ function in vivo (Genevaux et al., 2002). Additionally, Asp35JD/OD2 interacts with Gln378DnaK/NE2 in the NBD. Gln378 had not been implicated in DnaK-DnaJ interactions before. Thus, we replaced Gln378DnaK with alanine and determined the efﬁciency of DnaJ and a substrate to stimulate the
ATPase activity of the mutant protein. At the concentrations employed, the low basal ATPase rate of DnaKwt (0.0007 sÀ1) was stimulated 11.7-fold by DnaJ, 3.7-fold by the physiological substrate heat shock transcription factor s32, and 23-fold in the presence of both (Figure 3C). The basal ATPase activity of DnaK-Q378A was stimulated 2.9-fold by s32 but only 3-fold by
DnaJ and 5-fold when both co-factors were added, suggesting that Gln378DnaK is important for the interaction with DnaJ. Moreover, DnaK-Q378A was less efﬁcient than DnaKwt in refolding
chemically denatured luciferase in vitro (Figure 3D) and supported growth of a DdnaK strain at 40C less well when expressed a equal levels (Figures 3E and S2), suggesting that Gln378DnaK is important for DnaK’s chaperone activity in vitro
and in vivo.
Interactions of the J-Domain with the SBD Coordinates
Substrate Signal
Two polar/electrostatic and hydrophobic contact interfaces between the J-domain and DnaK ensure correct positioning of the J-domain at the NBD-SBD interface of DnaK (Figure S3). The ﬁrst interface is formed between helix II of the J-domain and lobe II of the NBD, involving Arg22JD/NH2-Glu206DnaK/OE1, Arg22JD/NH2-Glu217DnaK/OE1, Lys26JD/NZ-Glu217DnaK/OE1, and Arg27JD/NH2-Asp211DnaK/OD2 (Figure 4A). These residues
were implicated previously in DnaK-DnaJ interactions (Ahmad et al., 2011; Ga€ssler et al., 1998). The second contact interface is formed between the HPD motif and helix III of the J-domain and the SBDb of DnaK. This interface involves two polar contacts, Lys48JD/NZ-Asp477DnaK/OD1 and Lys51JD/NZ-Thr420DnaK/ OG1, and two hydrophobic contacts, Pro34JD-Pro419DnaK and Phe47JD-Pro419DnaK (Figures 3A, 3B, and 4B). To our knowledge, such an interaction has never been suggested before. However, Pro34JD and Phe47JD were shown to be important in vivo (Genevaux et al., 2002), and replacement of Pro419DnaK inﬂu-
ences substrate binding (Burkholder et al., 1996). We analyzed the importance of the remaining contacts for DnaK functions in vivo. In contrast to DnaK-T420A, DnaK-D477A was not able
to complement the temperature-sensitivity phenotype of the DdnaK strain when expressed at equal levels (Figures 4C and

S2). Consistently, a DdnaJ DcbpA strain harboring DnaJ-K48A or DnaJ-K48E exhibited growth defects at 40C (Figure S4A). These data suggest that the Asp477DnaK-Lys48JD contact, but not the Thr420DnaK-Lys51JD contact, is critical for the DnaK-DnaJ system in vivo. Of note, Lys51JD/NZ may also form contacts with Glu55JD/OE1 and OE2, which may weaken the Thr420DnaKLys51JD contact, suggesting a reason why its contribution to
the J-domain/DnaK interaction is small. However, the mutant
J-domain (DnaJ(1–75)-K51A) stimulated ATPase activity of wild-
type DnaK in synergism with a substrate peptide, comprising the DnaK recognition sequence within s32 (Rodriguez et al.,
2008), less efﬁciently than the wild-type J-domain of DnaJ (Figure S4B), suggesting that Lys51JD nevertheless contributes to
the interaction with DnaK. In contrast, DnaJ(1–75)-K48A did not
signiﬁcantly stimulate ATPase activity under these conditions
compared with stimulation of the peptide alone, indicating that

the Lys48JD-Asp477DnaK interaction is much more important. Similarly, the replacement of Lys26 and Arg36 of DnaJ(1–75), two other sites with polar contacts with DnaK (see above), with alanine also compromised J-domain function in single-turnover ATPase assays, indicating that these contacts are also much more important for the J-domain DnaK interaction than the Lys51JD-Thr420DnaK interaction (Figure S4B).
In vitro, DnaK-D477A refolded chemically denatured luciferase less efﬁciently than DnaKwt (Figure 4D). Individually, DnaJ and s32 stimulated the ATPase activity of DnaK-D477A only 1.7-fold and together 5.3-fold, which is signiﬁcantly lower than the stimulation of DnaKwt (Figure 4E). The decreased stimulation of DnaK-D477A’s ATPase activity by s32 relative to DnaKwt was unexpected, because Asp477 is more than 15 A˚ away from the substrate-binding cleft. Indeed, afﬁnity measurements revealed that DnaK-D477A has a 2.3-fold lower afﬁnity for the substrate

than DnaKwt (Figure 4F). However, the reduced afﬁnity of DnaKD477A for substrates was not responsible for the reduced synergistic stimulation of its ATPase activity. We compared the ATPase activity of DnaK-D477A in the presence of 20 nM DnaJ and increasing concentrations of s32 with the ATPase activity of DnaKwt and DnaK-M404A, a DnaK variant with an afﬁnity for substrates comparable to DnaK-D477A (Mayer et al., 2000). Despite a 2.8-fold lower afﬁnity for substrates, DnaK-M404A’s ATPase activity was as responsive to stimulation with increasing concentrations of s32 in the presence of DnaJ as DnaKwt’s ATPase activity (Figure 4G). In contrast, the ATPase activity of DnaK-D477A was stimulated much less efﬁciently, suggesting that Asp477 is indeed required for efﬁcient synergistic stimulation of ATPase activity by DnaJ and a substrate.
The backbone amide and carbonyl of Asp477 form hydrogen bonds with the amide and carbonyl of His485, which is contiguous to Leu484, a residue previously demonstrated to be an essential part of the signal transduction pathway from the substrate to the catalytic center for ATP hydrolysis (Kityk et al., 2015). Consistently, increasing concentrations of s32 also stimulated the ATP hydrolysis rate of DnaKwt less efﬁciently in the presence of DnaJ-K48A than in the presence of DnaJwt, demonstrating that disruption of the Lys48JD-Asp477DnaK interaction handicaps signal transduction from the substrate to the catalytic center in DnaKwt.
Residues Involved in the J-domain-Hsp70 Interaction Are Evolutionarily Conserved To answer the question whether the J-domain-Hsp70 interface is conserved in evolution we performed blast searches in

combination with multiple sequence alignments. We used E. coli DnaJ, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ydj1, and human DnaJA1 (Hdj2), as examples for class A JDPs, E. coli CbpA, S. cerevisiae Sis1, and human DnaJB1 (Hdj1) as examples of class B JDPs in a BLAST query against the UNIPROT90 (DnaJ, Ydj1, CbpA, and Sis1) database of clusters of 90% mutually identical protein sequences or against the database of vertebrate protein sequences (DnaJA1 and DnaJB1) on the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) EBI server. We retrieved 200 sequences for each query and performed a Clustal U alignment. After removal of incomplete sequences, we retained 200 (DnaJ), 198 (Ydj1), 187 (DnaJA1), 189 (CbpA), 200 (Sis1), and 183 (DnaJB1) sequences and analyzed the conservation of the residues indicated. Except for Lys51JD, which is not essential, all sites involved in the interaction of the J-domain with DnaK are conserved in JDPs from bacteria to humans (Figure 5, top). Similarly, the sequences of E. coli DnaK, S. cerevisiae Ssa1, and human Hsc70 were used as query against the UNIPROT90 and vertebrate database and the retrieved sequences (200 each) used in Clustal U alignments (Figure 5A, bottom). These alignments suggest that all J-domains interact with Hsp70s in a similar way. To test this hypothesis, we replaced Glu218, Gln376, and Asp479 in human Hsc70 (corresponding to Glu217, Gln378, and Asp477 in E. coli DnaK) with alanine and determined the single-turnover ATPase rates of wild-type and mutant proteins in the absence and presence of the human JDP Hdj1 (Figure 5B). Whereas the replacement of these residues in human Hsc70 did not affect basal ATPase activity, stimulation of ATPase activity by Hdj1 was signiﬁcantly lower, demonstrating that these residues are also important for functional interaction of the J-domain of human Hdj1 with human Hsc70.

In addition, we performed an alignment using all Hsp70 sequences found in the genomes of E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens, including the more distant relatives. Most sites in DnaK contacted by the J-domain are conserved in canonical Hsp70 proteins, but not in Hsp70 homologs that do not interact with JDPs, as the Hsp110s and Hsp70 components of the ribosome-associated complex (Figure S5). We also performed a similar alignment of all JDPs of E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and the class A and class B JDPs of humans. These alignments show some deviations between paralogs within the same organism (Figure S5), possibly tuning the interaction within the JDP network or allowing for specialized Hsp70-JDP pairs (Kluck et al., 2002; Pukszta et al., 2010; Schlenstedt et al., 1995; Silberg et al., 1998).
DISCUSSION
The structure we present of the J-domain in complex with Hsp70 in the ATP-bound open conformation explains a host of genetic, biochemical, and biophysical data. It conﬁrms previously proposed contacts of the J-domain with Hsp70’s NBD and interdomain linker, reveals previously unsuspected but mechanistically important interactions between the J-domain and the SBDb of Hsp70, and assigns a functional role for the universally

conserved HPD motif of the J-domain and the interdomain linker in Hsp70s. Our structure provides the basis for understanding how JDPs in synergism with substrate proteins stimulate ATP hydrolysis in Hsp70s and thus enables Hsp70s to rapidly trap misfolded proteins. Since the discovery that the paradigm JDP DnaJ stimulates the ATPase activity of DnaK (Liberek et al., 1991), many attempts have been made to solve the molecular mechanism of this interaction (Ahmad et al., 2011; Ga€ssler et al., 1998; Genevaux et al., 2002; Greene et al., 1998; Kumar et al., 2011; Smock et al., 2010; Suh et al., 1998, 1999). Residues identiﬁed in these studies to be affected by interaction are in close proximity in our structure, and residues found to be functionally important are either at the interface between the J-domain and Hsp70 or on the pathway to the catalytic ATPase center (Figure 2). The most recent attempt to derive a model for the J-domain-Hsp70 interaction used a combination of coarse-grain and atomistic models and evolutionary sequence analysis (Malinverni et al., 2017). The coevolutionary analysis in this study predicted three interaction pairs: Asn187DnaK-Lys23JD, Asp208DnaK-Lys26JD, and Thr189DnaKArg19JD. However, these residues do not form contacts in our structure. In fact, they are $10, 6, and 16 A˚ apart from each other, respectively. These residues might be important for initial contacts of the J-domain with DnaK, before attaining the ﬁnal position. Alternatively, coevolution of these residues may have different reasons. In addition, interactions between

and 211, which in our structure interact with Arg22JD and Arg27JD.

His422DnaK-Glu75JD and Gln424DnaK-Lys51JD were proposed. Glu75JD is not resolved in our structure. The distance between Gln424DnaK and Lys51JD is 14 A˚ in our structure, precluding interaction. Our mutagenesis data suggest that Lys51JD is not important for the DnaK-DnaJ interaction. Moreover, a Gln424to-cysteine replacement had no functional defects in vitro and in vivo and allowed DnaJ and ATP-dependent crosslinking of the protein substrate s32 to DnaK using a benzophenone crosslinker speciﬁcally attached to this cysteine in position 424 (Laufen et al., 1999). A possible explanation why coevolution analysis failed to reveal the pairs of residues interacting in our structure could be that these residues are highly conserved from bacteria to humans, and the number of deviations may be too small to yield a statistically signiﬁcant coupling.
It could be argued that by tethering the J-domain to the N terminus of DnaK, a nonphysiological interaction was forced. However, our functional characterization of the fusion construct (Figure S1) and our mutational analysis of DnaK (Figures 3 and 4) and J-domain (Figure S4) single-amino-acid replacement variants strongly argue that our structure represents the physiologically relevant interaction.

Our structure is in conﬂict with the crystal structure of the J-domain of auxilin in complex with the NBD of bovine Hsc70 (Jiang et al., 2007). Based on a genetic study (Suh et al., 1998), which suggested a direct interaction between Asp35 of DnaJ’s HPD motif and Arg167 in DnaK, Jiang and colleagues replaced Asp876 of the HPD motif in the J-domain of auxilin and Arg171 (corresponding to Arg167 of DnaK) in the NBD of Hsc70 with cysteines and tethered the J-domain to the NBD by a disulﬁde bridge. However, this structure could not provide a mechanism of J-domain function. As compared to our structure, the J-domain points in a diametrically opposite direction (Figure S6). The only commonality between our structure and the structure of Jiang et al. is the fact that the two residues used to introduce a disulﬁde bridge indeed interact with each other. However, an aspartatearginine interaction bridges $8 A˚ between the Ca atoms of the two residues, whereas the distance between the Ca atoms of a disulﬁde bridge is only $5 A˚ . This might be the reason why steric constraints prevented the J-domain to dock onto its natural docking site. Furthermore, the SBD of the Hsp70 was missing in the previous structure. In our structure, the J-domain interacts with the SBD as well as part of the mechanism of J-domain-substrate synergism, as demonstrated by us. The high conservation of interacting residues (Figure 5A) suggests that throughout evolution, J-domains dock onto Hsp70s in a very similar way and that the molecular mechanism of the J-domain-triggered ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70s is conserved as well.

Figure 6. Model for the Synergistic Stimula-

tion of the ATPase Activity of DnaK by DnaJ

and Substrate as Basis for Efﬁcient Trap-

ping of Substrates by Hsp70 Chaperones

(A) After ATP binding, the SBDb docks onto the

rotated lobes of the NBD by interaction between

Lys414 and Asp329 and between Asp481 with

Arg167 and Ile168, preventing back rotation to an

optimal position for ATP hydrolysis. In the absence

of substrate and a J-domain, basal ATPase activity

is very low (path 1). Mutating Lys414 or Asp481

increases ATPase activity by 25- to 80-fold (Kityk

et al., 2015). The addition of substrate (path 2) leads

to dissociation of the SBDb from the NBD through a

signal propagated through the SBDb to the NBD

(hatched arrows) (Zhuravleva et al., 2012), stimu-

lating ATPase activity, albeit by only 2- to 5-fold due

to complete release of the SBDb, which allows too

much freedom to the lobes of the NBD (green

arrows) and dissociation of the linker from the

lower crevice (blue arrow). The inefﬁcient stimula-

tion of ATPase activity traps substrates inefﬁciently

(transparent blue substrate symbol on DnaK), and

B

C

some substrates may dissociate before closure of

the substrate-binding pocket (arrow with trans-

parent blue substrate symbol). In the simultaneous

presence of DnaJ and a substrate (path 3), the

J-domain binds at the interface between SBDb and

NBD, stimulates ATPase activity directly through

the interaction network from the linker to the cata-

lytic center and indirectly by making DnaK more

sensitive to the substrate signal (solid arrows in the

SBDb), and prevents dissociation of SBDb and

linker, leading to a very high ATPase rate and

effective trapping of the substrate.

This hypothesis is supported by a mutational study using the J-domain of polyomavirus large T-antigen (Whalen et al., 2005). These authors identiﬁed several residues which compromise T antigen function in vivo and stimulation of the ATPase activity of Hsc70 in vitro. In a homology model of polyomavirus J-domain onto the J-domain of DnaJ in our structure and of human Hsc70 on DnaK in our structure, 5 of the 6 identiﬁed T-antigen residues would be within interaction distance to Hsc70, requiring only minor adjustments by rotation around single bonds. The remaining amino acid replacements (A33G) in T antigen would be expected to destabilize the J-domain, since in our model, it forms hydrophobic interaction with Leu19 of the J-domain. In addition, Ala33 is in the middle of helix II, and replacement by glycine is expected to break the helix. Thus, our structure is also consistent with a mutagenesis analysis of polyomavirus large T antigen in mammalian cells, suggesting conservation of the mechanistic principal of J-domain-Hsp70 interaction. Moreover, overlaying the J-domain of auxilin on the J-domain of DnaJ and homology modeling human Hsc70 onto DnaK reveals that auxilin could interact

with Hsc70 in a way similar to that of the J-domain of DnaJ with DnaK. In fact, mutations used by Jiang and colleagues to support their structure would also affect interaction in such a model. Our single-turnover ATPase data of human Hsc70 in the presence of the human JDP Hdj1 (Figure 5) support our claim that the interaction between the J-domain of DnaJ and DnaK revealed by our structure is evolutionarily conserved.
Our J-domain-DnaK structure allows us to propose a molecular mechanism of how JDPs trigger ATP hydrolysis of Hsp70 chaperones (Figure 6). Hsp70s possess very low basal ATPase activity, because ATP binding rotates the two lobes of the NBD into a position incompatible with g-phosphate cleavage and SBDb docking prevents back rotation of the NBD lobes (Kityk et al., 2012, 2015). Substrate binding perturbs the NBD-SBDb interface of Hsp70, releasing the structural constraints of the NBD, as suggested by NMR data (Zhuravleva et al., 2012), but increases the ATPase activity only moderately, since the catalytic residues often bypass the optimal position for hydrolysis due to the high rotational freedom of the NBD lobes. Full stimulation of ATPase activity is achieved

234 Molecular Cell 69, 227–237, January 18, 2018

in the presence of both substrate and J-domain. The J-domain makes signal transmission from the substrate-binding cleft to the NBD more efﬁcient and thus favors substrate-induced destabilization of the NBD-SBDb interface and initiation of the back rotation of the NBD lobes (Figure 6B). Concomitantly, substrate-induced conformational changes in the SBDb are transmitted to the J-domain (Figure S7; Movie S1), leading through the contacts of the HPD motif to a readjustment of the linker in the NBD crevice, and thereby arrest the NBD lobes and catalytic residues in a position optimal for ATP hydrolysis. In addition, the HPD motif accesses a hydrogen bond network that ends at the catalytic Glu171DnaK and Lys70DnaK (Figure 6C; Movie S2). Thus, the J-domain couples two signals to trigger ATP hydrolysis with concomitant trapping of the substrate. In this way, the Hsp70-JDP machinery achieves ultrahigh afﬁnity, with a non-equilibrium KD that is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the high-afﬁnity ADP-bound equilibrium state (De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014), and the high association rates necessary to efﬁciently compete with protein aggregation.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
For in vivo complementation assays E. coli BB1994 (DdnaK52 strain BB1553; Bukau and Walker, 1990; + lacIq plasmid pDM1.1; Lanzer and Bujard, 1988) or E. coli WKG190 (DdnaJ DcbpA strain; Kelley and Georgopoulos, 1997) were used.
METHOD DETAILS
Plasmid construction For the construction of an expression plasmid for JD-DnaK and JD-DnaKcryst the coding sequence of DnaJ(1-105) was ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primer JD_5 and JD-GF_3 (Table S1) and cloned into the EcoRI and BglII restriction sites of the arabinose-inducible expression plasmids pMPM-A4 (Mayer, 1995) containing the coding sequences for DnaKwt and DnaK(1-606)-E47C,T199A,F529C-His5 (Kityk et al., 2012). The dnaK genes in the resulting plasmids were completed by amplifying the dnaK sequence using primers dnaK-NdeI_5 and dnaK_936- (Table S1) and the plasmids pMPM-A4-dnaKwt and pMPM-A4-dnaK(1-606)-E47C,T199A,F529C-His5 as templates and insertion into the NdeI and BglII restriction sites. The expression plasmids for DnaJ(1-75) and DnaJ(1-105) were constructed by PCR ampliﬁcation of the respective dnaJ sequences using primers dnaJ_5, dnaJ(1-75)_3 and dnaJ(1-105)_3 and a wild-type dnaJ containing plasmid as template and insertion into the vector pMPM-A4-EcSUMO. Expression plasmids for mutant proteins were constructed by site directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1991) using the oligonucleotides listed in Table S1. DnaJ(1-75)-K26A was constructed by inserting the annealed primers K26A_s and K26A_as into the BlpI and RsrII restriction sites of pMPM-A4-EcSUMO-dnaJ(1-75). For complementation of the DdnaJ DcbpA strain WGK190 the coding sequences for DnaJwt and mutant proteins were cloned into pMPM-A6 (Mayer, 1995). For the complementation of the DdnaK52 strain mutant dnaK genes were cloned into pUHE21-2fdD12 (Buchberger et al., 1994). The coding sequences of all constructs were completely sequenced.
Protein puriﬁcation Puriﬁcation of JD-DnaK fusion proteins, DnaKwt and its variants – JD-DnaK fusion proteins, DnaKwt and its mutant variants were puriﬁed as native proteins with an N-terminal His-SUMO tag (DnaK variants) or a C-terminal His-tag (JD-DnaK fusion proteins) after overproduction in DdnaK52 cells (BB1553; Bukau and Walker, 1990). Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF), subjected to lysis by Microﬂuidizer Emulsi Flex C5 (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada), and afterward applied onto a column with Ni-IDA resin (Macherey-Nagel, Du€ren, Germany). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of lysis buffer and 10 column volumes of ATP buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP), and proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20mM Tris/HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 250 mM imidazol). In the case of His-SUMO-fused variants, the proteins were treated with Ulp1 protease to remove the His-SUMO tag from DnaK. Subsequently, the protein mixture was subjected again to a Ni-IDA column and the ﬂow-through fraction containing tag-free DnaK was collected. Nucleotides bound to DnaK were removed by treating the samples with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (AP; 2U AP per mg DnaK) at room temperature overnight during dialysis into the nucleotide removal buffer (50mM Tris/HCL, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM NaN3, 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). To remove alkaline phosphatase, DnaK was loaded onto an anion exchange column (Resource Q, GE Healthcare), equilibrated in low salt buffer (40 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 MgCl2), and eluted with a linear KCl gradient (0.1–1 M) of 10 column volumes (CV).
Puriﬁcation of DnaJwt and DnaJ-K48A – DnaJwt and DnaJ-K48A were puriﬁed as native proteins after overproduction in DdnaJ DcbpA E. coli cells (WKG190; Kelley and Georgopoulos, 1997). Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8, 10 mM DTT, 0.6% (w/v) Brij 58, 1 mM PMSF, 0.8 mg/ml Lysozyme) and lysed by Microﬂuidizer Emulsi Flex C5. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min and 1 volume of buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7, 5 mM DTT,
Molecular Cell 69, 227–237.e1–e4, January 18, 2018 e2

1 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Brij 58) was added to the supernatant. DnaJ was precipitated by addition of (NH4)2SO4 to a ﬁnal concentration of 65% (w/v) and the precipitate pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 30 min). The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in 220 mL buffer B (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Brij 58, 2 M Urea) and dialyzed against 5 L buffer B. DnaJ was loaded onto a cation exchange column (SP-Sepharose, equilibrated with buffer B), washed with buffer B and eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 666 mM KCl (15 CV). DnaJ containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 5 L buffer C (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 M Urea, 0.1% (w/v) Brij 58, 5 mM DTT, 50 mM KCl) and the sample was loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated in buffer C. The column was ﬁrst washed with 1 column volume (CV) buffer C supplemented with 1 M KCl, and then with 2 CV of buffer C. DnaJ was eluted with a linear gradient (0%–50%, 1 CV) of buffer D (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 M Urea, 0.1% (w/v) Brij 58, 5 mM DTT, 50 mM KCl, 600 mM KH2PO4) and 2 CV mL of 50% buffer D. The DnaJ containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 2 L buffer E (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mM KCl).
DnaJ(1-105) and DnaJ(1-75) and variants were expressed in pMPM-A4 (Mayer, 1995) and puriﬁed as native proteins with an N-terminal His-SUMO tag. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF), subjected to lysis by Microﬂuidizer Emulsi Flex C5 (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada), and afterward applied onto a column with Ni-IDA resin (Macherey-Nagel, Du€ren, Germany). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of lysis buffer and proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20mM Tris/HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 250 mM imidazol). The proteins were treated with Ulp1 protease to remove the His-SUMO tag and dialyzed against the storage buffer (40 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol). Subsequently, the protein mixture was subjected again to a Ni-IDA column and the ﬂow-through fraction containing tag-free DnaJ(1-105) or DnaJ(1-75) was collected.
Wild-type and mutant Hsc70 were produced recombinantly in E. coli BL21(DE3) pCODON+ as His6Smt3-fusion using expression plasmid pCA528-hsHSPA8 (Andre´ asson et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2017). Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/ HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF), subjected to lysis by Microﬂuidizer Emulsi Flex C5 (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada), and afterward applied onto a column with Ni-IDA resin (Macherey-Nagel, Du€ren, Germany). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of the lysis buffer and 10 column volumes of the ATP-buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP). Subsequently the proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20mM Tris/HCl pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 250 mM imidazol) and subjected to Ulp1 treatment to remove His-SUMO tag. The proteins were then dialyzed against the storage buffer (40 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol) and applied again onto Ni-IDA resin to yield a tag-free Hsc70 in the ﬂow-through fraction.
Hdj1 was production in E. coli WGK190 from the plasmid pUHE21-DNAJB1 (Ga€ssler et al., 2001) and puriﬁed using the same protocol as described above for E. coli DnaJ.
Protein crystallization, data collection and reﬁnement To stabilize the open conformation of the JD-DnaK-E47CDnaK-T199ADnaK-F529CDnaK fusion construct, the protein was oxidized in the presence of 5 mM ATP as described earlier (Kityk et al., 2012) and subsequently dialyzed against HKMG buffer (40 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol). To separate the intermolecular crosslinking products from intramolecular ones, the protein was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in HNKM buffer (40 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.6, 80 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2). Afterward, the protein was concentrated to 18 mg/ml and subjected to crystallization.
JD-DnaKcryst was crystallized at 291 K with sitting drop vapor diffusion technique. The reservoir composition was 9% w/v PEG 8000, 0.1 M calcium acetate, and 0.1 M imidazole pH 6.5. Reservoir volume was 90 ml. The crystallization drop contained 200 nL protein solution mixed with 100 nL reservoir solution. Crystals were visible after 20 h and harvested and ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen after 3 days using 20% glycerol as cryo-protectant. Diffraction data were collected from one crystal at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) beamline ID23 at 100 K at a wavelength of 0.873 A˚ .
Structure determination and reﬁnement – Diffraction data was integrated using XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and merged and scaled using AIMLESS (Evans, 2006). Phases were obtained by molecular replacement with PHASER (McCoy et al., 2007) using the structure of full-length DnaK (PBD: 4B9Q; Kityk et al., 2012) as search model. The structural model was iteratively built in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) alternating with cycles of reﬁnement in PHENIX (Afonine et al., 2012). The asymmetric unit contains one JD-DnaKcryst molecule. Molprobity (Chen et al., 2010) was used to assess the quality of the structure and indicated that 98.5% of residues were within favored Ramachandran regions. No residues were identiﬁed as Ramachandran outliers. The data collection and reﬁnement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Crystal contacts and the interface between DnaK and DnaJ were analyzed using PISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). DnaJ (residues R19 and K23) is involved in only one small crystal contact of 100 A˚ 2 interface size with a DnaK molecule related by symmetry operation –X+1, Y+1, Z.
Single turn-over ATPase assay The ATPase activities of DnaKwt and DnaK mutant proteins were determined under single turnover conditions. The DnaK-ATP complexes (ﬁnal volume 50 mL) were formed by mixing DnaK (ﬁnal concentration 30 mM) and 2 mL of ATP-mix (20 mM ATP, 12 mCi [a32P]-ATP) in reaction buffer A (25 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl 10 mM MgCl2 and leaving the mixture for 2 minutes on ice. The complex was isolated at 4C by gel ﬁltration on Sephadex G-50 (GE Healthcare) columns, pre-saturated with 1 mL of a BSA solution (1 mg/ml) and pre-equilibrated with 3 column volumes of buffer A. Twenty fractions (2 drops/fraction) were collected. The ﬁrst four fractions containing radioactivity as detected by a Geiger counter were pooled, divided into 6.5 mL aliquots, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at À80C. For the ATPase activity determination DnaK-ATP complexes were thawed in a water bath

at 30C and, after withdrawal of 0.5 mL for the 0 time point, mixed with 44 mL reaction buffer containing either no cofactors or 20-50 nM DnaJ (depending on the experiment) or 0.25 to 1 mM s32 or both. At different time points a 2 mL aliquot was spotted onto a PEI Cellulose TLC plate. Developing the plates in the TLC solution (400 mM LiCl, 10% acetic acid) separated ADP from ATP. Dried plates were exposed to FI-screens overnight and relative amounts of ATP and ADP were quantiﬁed by Fuji FLA 2000 Phosphoimager.
For JD-DnaK fusion protein and for DnaKwt in the presence of high concentration of DnaJ quenched-ﬂow instrument KinTek RQF-3 was used. DnaK (10 mM) was ﬁrst mixed with ATP (8 mM) than aged for 1 s and subsequently mixed with HKM buffer without proteins or including DnaJ (10 mM) at room temperature. At preset time points the reaction was quenched by diluting the mixture with 3 volumes of TLC solution. 2 mL of the quenched reaction were spotted onto a PEI Cellulose TLC plate, with subsequent nucleotides separation as described above.
Luciferase refolding assay Fireﬂy luciferase (10 mM) was denatured in unfolding buffer (30 mM Tris/acetate pH 7.5, 6 M guanidinium$HCl) for 10 min at 30C and subsequently diluted 125-fold (ﬁnal concentration 80 nM) into refolding buffer (25 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.6, 100 mM KAc, 10 mM MgAc2, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM DTT), containing DnaK (800 nM), DnaJ (40 nM) and GrpE (400 nM) at 30C. At different time points 1 mL of the reaction mixture was diluted into 124 mL of assay buffer (100 mM KxHyPO4 pH 7.6, 25 mM glycyl-glycine, 100 mM KAc, 15 mM MgAc2, 5 mM ATP) and subsequently mixed with 125 mL of luciferin (160 mM) in a Biolumat (Berthold). Upon mixing chemical luminescence was measured for 5 s.
In vivo complementation assay E. coli BB1994 (DdnaK strain) or E. coli WKG 190 (DdnaJ DcbpA strain) were transformed with plasmids containing IPTG-inducible dnaK alleles or L-arabinose-inducible dnaJ alleles, respectively, which harbored the mutations of interest. Tenfold serial dilutions of a 100-fold diluted overnight culture were spotted (10 mL) onto LB-agar plates, containing 50 mM IPTG or 6.6 mM L-arabinose, and appropriate antibiotics. Plates were incubated overnight at 30C and 40C. Protein expression levels at 40C were veriﬁed by immune blotting using a DnaK-speciﬁc Rabbit antiserum 47119 received from B. Bukau.
Substrate afﬁnity determination The dissociation equilibrium constants for the DnaK-substrate complexes were determined by ﬂuorescence intensity measurements. IAANS-labeled s32-Q132-Q144-C peptide (100 nM) was mixed in HKM buffer (25 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2) and incubated with increasing concentrations of DnaKwt or DnaK-D477A (in the range of 0.6 nM – 10 mM) at 30C for at least 30 min. Subsequently, the ﬂuorescence intensity was measured on a ClarioStar plate reader (excitation ﬁlter: 360-20; emission ﬁlter: 450-10). In order to calculate KD values the obtained results were ﬁtted by the quadratic solution of the law of mass action. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All biochemical assays were performed at least 3 times independently. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software). Statistical signiﬁcance was estimated by ANOVA tests as indicated in ﬁgure legends.
