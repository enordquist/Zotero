a b s t r a c t To determine how intracellular Ca2ϩ and membrane voltage regulate the gating of large conductance Ca2ϩ-activated Kϩ (BK) channels, we examined the steady-state and kinetic properties of mSlo1 ionic and gating currents in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ over a wide range of voltage. The activation of unliganded mSlo1 channels can be accounted for by allosteric coupling between voltage sensor activation and the closed (C) to open (O) conformational change (Horrigan, F.T., and R.W. Aldrich. 1999. J. Gen. Physiol. 114:305–336; Horrigan, F.T., J. Cui, and R.W. Aldrich. 1999. J. Gen. Physiol. 114:277–304). In 0 Ca2ϩ, the steady-state gating charge-voltage (QSS-V) relationship is shallower and shifted to more negative voltages than the conductance-voltage (GK-V) relationship. Calcium alters the relationship between Q-V and G-V, shifting both to more negative voltages such that they almost superimpose in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. This change reﬂects a differential effect of Ca2ϩ on voltage sensor activation and channel opening. Ca2ϩ has only a small effect on the fast component of ON gating current, indicating that Ca2ϩ binding has little effect on voltage sensor activation when channels are closed. In contrast, open probability measured at very negative voltages (less than Ϫ80 mV) increases more than 1,000-fold in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, demonstrating that Ca2ϩ increases the C-O equilibrium constant under conditions where voltage sensors are not activated. Thus, Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor activation act almost independently, to enhance channel opening. This dual-allosteric mechanism can reproduce the steady-state behavior of mSlo1 over a wide range of conditions, with the assumption that activation of individual Ca2ϩ sensors or voltage sensors additively affect the energy of the C-O transition and that a weak interaction between Ca2ϩ sensors and voltage sensors occurs independent of channel opening. By contrast, macroscopic IK kinetics indicate that Ca2ϩ and voltage dependencies of C-O transition rates are complex, leading us to propose that the C-O conformational change may be described by a complex energy landscape.

INTRODUCTION
Ion channels activate by sensing stimuli such as membrane voltage or ligand binding and transducing this information into conformational changes that open the channel pore. Thus, a key question to understanding ion channel function is how the protein domains involved in sensing stimuli (sensors) and opening the pore (gates) communicate. We addressed this question in mSlo1 large conductance Ca2ϩ-activated Kϩ (BK) channels by measuring ionic and gating currents over a wide range of voltage and [Ca2ϩ] (for abbreviations and parameters used in this paper, see Table I).
To characterize sensor–gate interaction ideally, one would like to monitor both sensor and gate activity and determine what effect the state of one has on the functional properties of the other. However, this approach

is problematic for many channels because the kinetics and equilibrium properties of sensor activation and channel opening are too similar to allow one process to be studied while the other remains in a ﬁxed state. In addition, for cases in which certain combinations of sensor and gate conformation are prohibited, the conditions under which interactions can be probed will be restricted. For instance, channel opening in many voltage-gated channels cannot be studied when voltage sensors are in a nonactivated state (Islas and Sigworth, 1999).
Large conductance BK channels possess many advantages as a system for studying interactions between sensors and gates. First, voltage- and ligand-dependent gating mechanisms can be studied in the same channel. Second, the mechanisms of voltage sensor activation, Ca2ϩ-binding, and channel opening appear simple and reasonably represented as two-state processes. The homotetrameric nature of the channel and the absence of inactivation also help to limit the potential complexity of interactions between sensors and gates. Third, closed to open state transition kinetics in Slo1 channels are

slow relative to voltage sensor activation and Ca2ϩ-binding (Cox et al., 1997a; Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999). This simpliﬁes the analysis of

macroscopic IK kinetics and allows sensor function to be examined while channels are maintained in either an open or closed conformation. Fourth, voltage sensors and Ca2ϩ sensors appear to interact with channel opening through allosteric mechanisms such that no combination of sensor and gate conformation is prohibited. Finally, the sensitivity of BK channels to both Ca2ϩ and voltage allows the manipulation of channel function in ways that facilitate analysis of sensor–gate interaction.
In the present study, we address several features of BK channel gating that are readily explained by allosteric models. Our ability to test this mechanism and to characterize sensor–gate interaction in BK channels depends on isolating subsets of transitions under extreme conditions and measuring both ionic and gating currents. For example, we show that the effect of Ca2ϩ-binding on channel opening is best characterized when the C-O equilibrium constant is reduced by forcing voltage sensors into a resting state at extreme negative voltages. Conversely, some effects of channel opening on voltage sensor activation are best detected when the open conformation is stabilized by high [Ca2ϩ]. The observed properties of Ca2ϩ- and voltage-dependent transitions and their relationship to each other deﬁne how Ca2ϩ and voltage interact to determine mSlo1 channel activity.
The BK Channel Gating Mechanism
Because the response of BK channels to Ca2ϩ and voltage is complex, it is useful to present our results in the framework of a plausible general model. BK channel gating involves voltage sensor activation, Ca2ϩ binding, channel opening, and some interaction among these three processes. Previous analysis of ionic and gating currents from mSlo1 in 0 Ca2ϩ ([Ca2ϩ] Ͻ 1 nM) showed that voltage sensor activation promotes channel opening through an allosteric mechanism, illustrated in Fig. 1 A, Scheme I (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999). In Scheme I, voltage sensors in each of the four identical subunits can undergo transitions between resting (R) and activated (A) conformations. In addition, the channel can undergo a transition between closed (C) and open (O) conformations. Voltage sensor activation and channel opening interact through an allosteric mechanism, represented by a factor D, such that the C-O equilibrium constant increases D-fold for each voltage sensor activated, and the R-A equilibrium constant increases D-fold when the channel opens.
A key feature of an allosteric interaction is that the two processes involved inﬂuence each other but are not coupled obligatorily. That is, channels can open even if voltage sensors are not activated and voltage sensors can activate whether channels are closed or open. Therefore, Scheme I speciﬁes a 10-state gating scheme (Fig. 1 B, Scheme I*) with 5 closed and 5 open states representing

268 Coupling of Voltage Sensor, Ca2ϩ Binding, and Channel Opening

the C and O conformations with 0–4 activated voltage sensors. Similar schemes have been proposed to describe the activation of other voltage-dependent channels (Marks and Jones, 1992; Rios et al., 1993; McCormack et al., 1994), and the basic ﬁnding that channels undergo both independent and concerted (or cooperative) transitions is well established (Sigworth, 1994; Zagotta et al., 1994). The kinetic and equilibrium properties of mSlo1 channels allow us to study these transitions in isolation (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999), an advantage that will be exploited here to determine the mechanism of Ca2ϩ action.
Several lines of evidence indicate that Ca2ϩ-binding also inﬂuences channel opening through an allosteric mechanism. The voltage-dependent activation of unliganded channels shows that Ca2ϩ-binding is not obligatory for channel opening or for voltage sensor activation (Cui et al., 1997; Nimigean and Magleby, 2000; Talukder and Aldrich, 2000). Similarly, macroscopic IK relaxation kinetics are altered by Ca2ϩ in a saturable manner, indicating that Ca2ϩ binding is not a rate-limiting step in channel activation. The kinetic and steadystate properties of mSlo1 activation in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ exhibit similar voltage dependencies (Cox et al., 1997a; Cui et al., 1997; Rothberg and Magleby, 2000), suggesting that a similar gating scheme with altered rate constants might account for the activation of unliganded and Ca2ϩ-bound channels. In line with this prediction, single channel data from native BK channels in high Ca2ϩ are consistent with a two-tiered gating scheme for Ca2ϩ-bound channels similar to Scheme I* (Rothberg and Magleby, 1999). Moreover, an allosteric model of Ca2ϩ action reproduces many features of macroscopic mSlo1 IK over a wide range of Ca2ϩ despite the use of a simpliﬁed voltage-gating mechanism (Cox et al., 1997a; Cui et al., 1997).

Figure 1. Slo1 gating mechanisms. (A) The unliganded gating mechanism (Scheme I) involves an allosteric interaction between channel opening (C-O) and voltage sensor activation (R-A). L is the C-O equilibrium constant when all voltage sensors are in the resting (R) state. J is the R-A equilibrium constant when channels are closed. D is the allosteric interaction factor such that the C-O equilibrium constant increases D-fold for each voltage sensor activated, and the R-A equilibrium constant increases D-fold when the channel opens. (B) Scheme I speciﬁes a 10-state gating scheme (Scheme I*) with the indicated equilibrium constants. Subscripts for closed and open states denote 0–4 activated voltage sensors. (C) A general allosteric gating mechanism (Scheme II) includes a Ca2ϩ binding transition (X-XCa) for each subunit with an equilibrium constant K ϭ [Ca2ϩ]/KD when channels are closed and voltage sensors are not activated. Allosteric interactions of Ca2ϩ binding with channel opening and voltage sensor activation are determined by allosteric factors C and E, respectively, as described in the text.

A General Allosteric Model of BK Channel Gating
Any BK channel gating scheme that incorporates four identical subunits and accounts for the effects of both Ca2ϩ and voltage must necessarily contain a large number of states (Cox et al., 1997a). In addition to the four voltage sensors, each channel presumably contains at least four high afﬁnity Ca2ϩ binding sites, since doseresponse relationships describing the effect of micro molar Ca2ϩ on steady-state open probability require Hill coefﬁcients greater than three (Cox et al., 1997a; Rothberg and Magleby, 2000). To describe a channel that can be open or closed with any number (0–4) of Ca2ϩ-bound and voltage sensors activated requires a minimum of 50 states, divided into two interconnected tiers of open and closed states (Horrigan et al., 1999; Rothberg and Magleby, 1999; Cox and Aldrich, 2000; Cui and Aldrich, 2000; Rothberg and Magleby, 2000).
Despite the apparent complexity of a large gating

Figure 2. Mechanisms of interaction between voltage sensors and Ca2ϩ-binding sites. (A1) If the binding of Ca2ϩ to a single subunit affects voltage sensors equally then voltage sensor equilibrium constants in all four subunits will increase E-fold to JE as indicated. (A2) In Scheme II, we assume Ca2ϩ binding only affects the voltage sensor in the same subunit. Consequently, the A2 mechanism predicts more states than the A1 mechanism. (B) For example, when a channel has two Ca2ϩ-bound (open circles) and two voltage sensors activated (open squares), the A2 mechanism speciﬁes three states depending on the relative location of Ca2ϩ and activated voltage sensors. That the states are functionally distinct can be seen by comparing the different Ca2ϩbinding equilibria for the unoccupied binding sites (K,K), (K,KE), and (KE,KE). Equilibrium constants for voltage sensor activation are also different. By contrast, the A1 mechanism speciﬁes a single state with equilibrium constants KE2 for Ca2ϩ binding and JE2 for voltage sensor activation (not depicted).

scheme, the mechanism underlying such a model and the parameters required to describe it may be relatively simple as illustrated by Fig. 1 C, Scheme II. The homotetrameric nature of the mSlo1 channel implies that high afﬁnity binding sites are identical. Thus, in Scheme II, Ca2ϩ binds to these subunits with identical equilibrium constants K. The independence of the binding sites is an initial simplifying assumption. As in Scheme I, the gating of unliganded channels is speciﬁed by an allosteric interaction between voltage sensor activation (R-A) and channel opening (C-O). Similarly, Ca2ϩ is coupled to channel gating through allosteric interactions represented by the factors C and E that connect the Ca2ϩ-binding transitions to the C-O and R-A voltage sensor transitions respectively. The steady-state properties of this model are fully described by three allosteric factors (C, D, E) and three equilibrium constants (J, K, L):

Scheme II highlights an important strategy used in

our analysis: to deﬁne the simplest mechanism—

rather than the gating scheme with the fewest kinetic

states—that can account for the data. The simplest or

most physically plausible mechanism often does not

produce the fewest states. The number of states speci-

ﬁed by Scheme II is determined by the nature of interactions between C-O, R-A, and X-XCa2ϩ transi-

tions. Interactions of channel opening with voltage

sensors and Ca2ϩ binding sites are the most easily de-

ﬁned. If the C-O transition is concerted, channel

opening should affect individual subunits equally.

Therefore, by energy conservation, each bound Ca2ϩ

or activated voltage sensor must have an additive ef-

fect on the energy of the C-O transition, increasing

the C-O equilibrium constant C- or D-fold, respectively. By contrast, interactions between the X-XCa2ϩ

and R-A transitions in Scheme II do not involve a con-

Under extreme conditions that limit Ca2ϩ-binding, voltage sensor activation, or channel opening, the number of interactions that govern mSlo1 gating is reduced and Scheme II is reduced to the following subschemes.

certed transition and several mechanisms can be postulated, each resulting in a different number of functionally distinct states.
In cases where no interaction between Ca2ϩ binding sites and voltage sensors exist, Scheme II will deﬁne a gating scheme with the minimum 50 states and PO can be described by Eq. 1 with E ϭ 1 (Cox and Aldrich, 2000; Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001). A 50-state scheme is also generated if Ca2ϩ binding to one subunit affects voltage sensors in all subunits equally and the activation of a voltage sensor affects all Ca2ϩ-binding sites equally (Fig. 2 A1). However, this would require a complex mechanism for coordinated communication among subunits independent of their relative positions in the tetramer. The equation describing such a mechanism is more complex than Eq. 1 (Cui and Aldrich, 2000). We will instead make the simplifying assumption that Ca2ϩ binding sites and voltage sensors can only interact within the same subunit (Fig. 2 A2). This assumption, although mechanistically and mathematically simpler, increases

the number of states to 70 because interactions between voltage sensors and Ca2ϩ binding sites now depend on their relative location within the tetramer, and some combinations of i-activated voltage sensors and j-occupied binding sites are no longer energetically equivalent. For example, a channel with two activated voltage sensors and two Ca2ϩ bound can exist in three distinct states depending on whether Ca2ϩ and activated voltage sensors are in the same or different subunits (Fig. 2 B). More general gating schemes that distinguish the relative Ca2ϩ occupancy and/or voltage sensor conformation in adjacent and diagonally opposed subunits result in even more than 70 states (Cox et al., 1997a) but, like the 50-state model, require additional mechanisms to account for interactions between or among voltage sensors and Ca2ϩ binding sites in different subunits.
The general allosteric model (Scheme II) illustrates some questions and strategies that motivated this study. Does the allosteric effect of Ca2ϩ on BK channel activation occur via effects on voltage sensor activation, chan-

nel opening or both? In terms of Scheme II, the answer to this fundamental question reduces to the evaluation and comparison of the interaction factors C and E. To accomplish this and to characterize Ca2ϩ-binding, voltage sensor activation, and channel opening transitions, we studied mSlo1 gating under a range of conditions that allow us to isolate subsets of the interactions in Scheme II. Fig. 3 shows the sub-schemes that describe mSlo1 for various conditions that are approximated in our results. The unliganded (sub-Scheme IIa) or Ca2ϩsaturated (sub-Scheme IIb) conditions were approximated in sub-nanomolar or 70–100 ␮M Ca2ϩ respectively. Voltage sensors were forced into resting (subScheme IIc) or activated (sub-Scheme IId) states at extreme negative or positive voltages. Finally, by taking advantage of the relatively slow C-O transition kinetics, we studied gating while channels remain brieﬂy in a closed (sub-Scheme IIe) or open (sub-Scheme IIf) conformation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Channel Expression
Experiments were performed with the mbr5 clone of the mouse homologue of the Slo1 gene (mSlo1) (Butler et al., 1993) expressed in Xenopus oocytes or HEK 293 cells. The clone was modiﬁed to facilitate mutagenesis and was propagated and cRNA transcribed as described previously (Cox et al., 1997b). Xenopus oocytes were injected 3–7 d before recording with ‫ف‬0.5–5 ng or ‫ف‬50 ng of cRNA for ionic current or gating current experiments respectively (50 nl, 0.01–1 ng/nl). mSlo1 was also subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (SR␣, provided by Dr. A.P. Braun, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada) containing the SV-40 promoter. HEK 293 cells expressing the large T-antigen of the SV-40 virus were cotransfected with mSlo1 and green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP, as a marker) using LipofectAMINE (GIBCO BRL/ Life Technologies, Inc.) 3 d before recording.
Electrophysiology
Currents were recorded using the patch clamp technique in the inside out conﬁguration (Hamill et al., 1981). Upon excision, patches were transferred to a separate chamber and washed with at least 20ϫ volumes of internal solution. Kϩ currents were recorded with internal solutions containing (in mM) 110 KMeSO3, 20 HEPES, and an external (pipette) solution containing 104 KMeSO3, 6 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 20 HEPES. Gating currents were recorded with internal solutions containing 135 N-methyl-d-glucamine(NMDG)-MeSO3, 20 HEPES, and an external solution containing 125 tetraethylammonium(TEA)-MeSO3, 6 TEA-Cl, 2 MgCl2, 20 HEPES. Internal solutions contained 40 ␮M (ϩ)-18crown-6-tetracarboxylic acid (18C6TA) to chelate con-

taminant Ba2ϩ (Diaz et al., 1996; Neyton, 1996; Cox et al., 1997b). “0 Ca2ϩ” solutions contained 2 mM EGTA reducing free Ca2ϩ to an estimated 0.8 nM based on the presence of ‫ف‬10 ␮M contaminant Ca2ϩ (Cox et al., 1997b). Ca2ϩ solutions were buffered with 2 or 5 mM HEDTA and CaCl2, and free Ca2ϩ was measured with a Ca2ϩ-electrode (Orion Research, Inc.). Total ClϪ was adjusted to 10 mM with HCl. The pH of all solutions was adjusted to 7.2. Solutions were prepared and experiments performed at 20ЊC (approximately Ϯ1ЊC).
Electrodes were pulled from thick walled 1010 glass (World Precision Instruments), coated with wax (KERR sticky wax) to minimize electrode capacitance (‫ف‬1 pF), and ﬁre-polished before use. Pipette access resistance measured in the bath solution (0.5–1.5 M⍀) was used as an estimate of series resistance (Rs) to correct the pipette voltage (Vp) at which IK was recorded. The corrected pipette voltage, Vm, was used in determining membrane conductance (GK) from tail current measurements and in plotting the voltage dependence of GK or the time constant of IK relaxation (␶[IK]). Series resistance error was Ͻ15 mV for all data presented and Ͻ10 mV for ␶(IK) measurements.
Data were acquired with an Axopatch 200B ampliﬁer (Axon Instruments, Inc.) set in patch mode with the Axopatch’s internal 4-pole Bessel ﬁlter set at 100 kHz. Currents were subsequently ﬁltered by an 8-pole Bessel ﬁlter (Frequency Devices, Inc.) at 20 kHz (Ig) or 50 kHz (IK) and sampled at 100 kHz with a 16 bit A/D converter (Instrutech ITC-16). Macroscopic currents were recorded at a relatively low gain (1–2 mV/pA) to avoid saturation of capacitive transients in response to voltage steps that often exceeded 300 mV. In addition, for gating currents, the voltage command was ﬁltered at 20 kHz to limit the speed of fast capacitive transients so that they could be sampled accurately and subtracted. Gating current records were typically signal averaged in response to at least eight voltage pulses. A P/4 protocol was used for leak subtraction (Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1974) except at voltages less than the holding potential where a P/8 protocol was used to avoid channel activation during the leak pulses. The holding potential was adjusted from Ϫ80 mV in 0 Ca2ϩ to Ϫ120 mV in 1,000 ␮M Ca2ϩ.
A Macintosh-based computer system was used in combination with Pulse Control acquisition software (Herrington and Bookman, 1995) and Igor Pro for graphing and data analysis (WaveMetrics, Inc.). A Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used to perform nonlinear least-squared ﬁts. Error estimates for ﬁt parameters are given as Ϯ SD.

form population of channels opening with very low
probability (Horrigan et al., 1999). Normalized open probability (PO/POMAX ϭ NPO/
NPOMAX) was determined by combining NPO measurements with an estimate of NPOMAX obtained from the macroscopic GK-V relationship in the same patch (NPOMAX ϭ GKMAX/gK, where gK is the single channel conductance). Patches that were used to measure
single channel activity at negative voltages often produced currents that were too large to measure (Ͼ20
nA) at voltages that activate mSlo1 channels maxi-
mally. In these cases, Gmax was estimated by ﬁtting the macroscopic GK-V with a Boltzmann function

{1 ϩ exp[Ϫz(V Ϫ Vh)/kT]} raised to a power n (e.g., Fig. 4 C1), where z and n were determined at each [Ca2ϩ] from other patches where the entire GK-V relationship was measured.
For voltages Ͼ60 mV from the reversal potential (0 mV), single channel amplitudes were large enough that false opening events due to noise were not detected using 20 kHz ﬁltering. The prevalence of false events was assessed by evaluating the number of current transients from the closed level that exceed the 1/2 amplitude criterion in a direction opposite to that of channel opening. When determining PO-V relationships over a large voltage range, currents were digitally ﬁltered at 5 kHz before determining NPO such that false events were not observed at 20 or Ϫ20 mV. For V Ͼ 60 mV no difference in NPO was observed with 5 or 20 kHz ﬁltering. However, for V Ͻ Ϫ60 mV a decrease in NPO was observed at 5 kHz, reﬂecting the brevity of open times at these voltages. The largest decreases (‫ف‬30%) were observed at the most negative voltages in 0 Ca2ϩ and little change was observed for [Ca2ϩ] Ͼ 1 ␮M. Thus, PO in low Ca2ϩ may be underestimated. To minimize this effect, dose-response relationships used to quantify the effect of Ca2ϩ on channel activation (Fig. 9) were determined from NPO at V Ͻ Ϫ80 mV using 20 kHz ﬁltering.
Shifts in Voltage-dependent Parameters
Patch to patch variations in the half-activation voltage (Vh) of GK-V and Q-V relationships are observed for mSlo1 (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999) and hSlo1 (Stefani et al., 1997), possibly due to differences in the redox state of channels (DiChiara and Reinhart, 1997; Tang et al., 2001). Such shifts do not appreciably alter the shape of voltage-dependent relationships but make comparison of data between different experiments difﬁcult and cause broadening in averaged voltage-dependent relationships. To compensate for this effect, Vh was determined for each patch and compared with the mean for all experiments (ϽVhϾ) at the same [Ca2ϩ]. Data from individual experiments were then shifted along the voltage-axis by ⌬Vh ϭ (ϽVhϾ Ϫ Vh) before averaging. This procedure yields average relationships that accurately represent the shape of individual GK-V and Q-V relationships.
Admittance Analysis
Admittance analysis was performed as described previously (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999). Brieﬂy, in gating current solutions, the membrane was clamped with a sinusoidal voltage command (868 Hz, 60 mV peak to peak) superimposed on a 1 s voltage-ramp. The voltage command and current signal were both ﬁltered at 20 kHz and current was sampled at 18-␮s intervals (64

samples/period). Admittance was determined for each cycle of the sinusoid. Gating capacitance (Cg[V]) was determined as the voltage-dependent component of patch admittance appearing at a phase angle of 90Њ relative to the command voltage (after correction for instrumentation phase delays).
RESULTS
Effects of Ca2ϩ on mSlo1 Ionic Currents
The basic effects of micromolar Ca2ϩ on BK channel gating are shown in Fig. 4, which compares macroscopic IK recorded from mSlo1 channels in the presence of internal solutions containing 0 Ca2ϩ or 70–100 ␮M Ca2ϩ, which correspond approximately to unliganded (subScheme IIa) or Ca2ϩ-saturated (sub-Scheme IIb) conditions, respectively. 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ may be insufﬁcient to completely saturate high afﬁnity Ca2ϩ binding sites, which we estimate later to have KDs on the order of 1 and 10 ␮M for open and closed channels, respectively (Cox et al., 1997a). However, concentrations of Ca2ϩ or other divalent cations in the 100 ␮M to 100 mM range produce distinct effects on channel gating that have been attributed to nonselective, low-afﬁnity (millimolar) binding sites (Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001). As a compromise, 70–100 ␮M Ca2ϩ was used throughout this study to approximate the Ca2ϩ-saturated condition for high afﬁnity binding sites while minimizing possible contributions from low afﬁnity sites.
Fig. 4 A compares IK evoked at different voltages in 0 or 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. Ca2ϩ increases the steady-state open probability (PO) such that conductance-voltage (GK-V) relationships shift to more negative voltages (Fig. 4 C1). The records in Fig. 4 A indicate that Ca2ϩ speeds IK activation during the pulse and slows deactivation at Ϫ80 mV after the pulse. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 4 B, where currents evoked by pulses to 160 mV in 0 and 100 ␮M Ca2ϩ from the same patch have been superimposed and normalized. Activation and deactivation kinetics are well ﬁt by exponential functions following a brief delay (dashed lines) (Horrigan et al., 1999). The time constants (␶[IK]) of such ﬁts over a wide range of voltages in 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ are plotted in Fig. 4 D1.
Figs. 4, C1 and D1, show that Ca2ϩ shifts the GK-V and ␶(IK)-V relationships along the voltage axis with little change in shape, suggesting that unliganded and ligand-bound channels gate by similar mechanisms. Indeed, Scheme II reduces, in saturating Ca2ϩ (Fig. 3, sub-Scheme IIb), to a 10-state gating scheme (Fig. 4 E, sub-Scheme IIb*) analogous to the unliganded scheme (Fig. 1, Scheme I*)(Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999). Despite this general similarity, signiﬁcant changes in the shape of GK-V and ␶(IK)-V relationships are observed when the plots obtained in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ are shifted by 135 mV to align them with the 0 Ca2ϩ

data (Fig. 4, C2 and D2). Such differences are expected if mSlo1 gating is governed by multiple voltage-dependent processes (e.g., C-O and R-A transitions).
In general, Ca2ϩ will shift the GK-V and ␶(IK)-V relationships without changing their shape only if the rate constants in the unliganded scheme (Fig. 1, Scheme I*) at any voltage V are identical to those for the Ca2ϩsaturated scheme (Fig. 4 E, sub-Scheme IIb*) at V-⌬V. Since the horizontal (R-A) transitions are more voltage dependent than the vertical (C-O) transitions, this condition can only be satisﬁed if voltage sensor activation is more Ca2ϩ dependent than channel opening. In fact we will show that the opposite is true. Therefore, the relationship between the horizontal and vertical transitions in Schemes I* and IIb* is altered by Ca2ϩ in a manner that cannot be compensated for by voltage, producing a change in the shape of the GK-V and ␶(IK)-V relations.
Effects of Ca2ϩ on Gating Current
The data in Fig. 4 are insufﬁcient to determine if Ca2ϩ effects channel opening (C-O) or voltage sensor acti-

vation (R-A) because IK kinetics and steady-state activation are generally dependent on both processes
(Horrigan et al., 1999). To help address this question mSlo1 gating currents (Ig) were compared in 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. As the following analysis indicates (Figs. 5–7), the Ca2ϩ sensitivity of Ig can be attributed mainly to an effect on channel opening and the interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor acti-
vation is weak. Ig evoked by 1-ms pulses to 160 mV in 0 or 70 ␮M

tial function (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999), whereas the 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ trace has an obvious slow component
(see also Fig. 5 D). In addition, OFF gating currents (IgOFF) recorded at Ϫ80 mV after the pulse are slowed substantially in the presence of Ca2ϩ.
Since Ca2ϩ affects gating current and shifts the voltage dependence of GK and ␶(IK), it might appear reasonable to conclude that Ca2ϩ acts by promoting volt-

of Qp versus pulse duration determined from A and ﬁt with double exponential functions. The 160-mV trace (᭢) was ob-

are plotted. Individual Q-Vs were nor-
malized based on ﬁts to Boltzmann func-
tions. Boltzmann ﬁts to the cumulative data are shown (0 Ca2ϩ: z ϭ 0.59, Vh ϭ 150 mV, 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ: z ϭ 1.19, Vh ϭ 40 mV). G-Vs (mean Ϯ SEM) were mea-

age sensor activation (Diaz et al., 1998). However, a closer examination of gating charge movement reveals that this is not the case. Although gating currents provide a direct assay of voltage sensor activation, they are also inﬂuenced by channel opening. Indeed, we have shown previously that mSlo1 Ig exhibits multiple kinetic components reﬂecting C-C, O-O, and C-O transitions in Scheme I* (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999). These components must be isolated before conclusions can be drawn about the mechanism of Ca2ϩ action.
The Ca2ϩ Dependence of Slow Gating Charge Movement
IgON evoked during a pulse to 160 mV in 0 Ca2ϩ (Fig. 5 A) consists of a prominent fast component, represent-

ing voltage sensor activation while channels are closed, and an additional component that is ‫ف‬100-fold slower.
The relaxation of the slow component, like IK activation, is limited by the speed of channel opening (Horri-
gan and Aldrich, 1999) and therefore should exhibit a Ca2ϩ and voltage dependence similar to that of ␶(IK) (Fig. 4 B). To examine the slow component in detail, Ig was measured in response to pulses of different duration to 160 mV in 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (Fig. 5 B).
The total charge moved during each pulse (QP) was determined by integrating IgOFF and is plotted versus pulse duration in Fig. 5 C. These QP time courses, which indicate the kinetics of ON charge movement,
are ﬁt with double exponential functions (solid lines).
Prominent slow components are observed in both 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ representing 43% and 47% of the

Figure 7. Ca2؉ has little effect on fast
gating charge movement. The fast com-
ponents of IgON evoked at 160 mV in 0 Ca2ϩ (A) and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (B) are determined by ﬁtting the ﬁrst 100 ␮s of
the decay with exponential functions (dashed lines; 0 Ca: ␶gfast ϭ 69.7 ␮s, 70 ␮M Ca: ␶gfast ϭ 73.6 ␮s). Fast charge movement (Qfast) was estimated by integrating under the exponential ﬁts
(shaded areas in A and B). Qfast-V relationships (mean Ϯ SEM) are plotted on
linear (C) and semilog (D) scales for 0 Ca2ϩ (solid symbols, n ϭ 10) and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (open symbol, n ϭ 7). To deter-
mine mean Qfast, normalized Qfast-V relationships from individual experi-
ments were shifted along the voltageaxis by ⌬Vh ϭ ϽVhϾ-Vh to align their half-activation voltages (Vh) to the mean (0 Ca2ϩ: ϽVhϾ ϭ 155 mV; 70 ␮M Ca: ϽVhϾ ϭ 135 mV). Then the shifted data were averaged in 25 mV bins (see
materials and methods). The mean
Qfast-Vs are ﬁt by Boltzmann functions (lines) where the valence z ϭ 0.58 e was
constrained to the mean voltage sensor
charge determined from ﬁts to individual Qfast-Vs in 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. (E) Mean ␶gfast-V relationships were determined in 60 mV bins after individual ␶gfast-V relationships were normalized to peak ␶gfast and shifted by ⌬Vh (as determined from Qfast-V relationships in C). The curves are ﬁt with functions of the form ␶gfast ϭ [␣0eϪz␣/kT ϩ ␤0eϪz␤/kT]Ϫ1 where z␣ϭ 0.33 e, z␤ ϭ Ϫ0.22 e and 0 Ca: ␣0 ϭ 1,020 sϪ1, ␤0 ϭ 32,500 sϪ1; 70 Ca: ␣0 ϭ 1,220 sϪ1, ␤0 ϭ 25,500 sϪ1. (F) Cg-V relationships measured with admittance analysis in 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ for a single patch indicate a Ca2ϩ-dependent
shift in the voltage dependence of fast
charge movement. The membrane was clamped with a sinusoidal voltage command (868 Hz, 60 mV peak to peak) superimposed on a 1-s voltage-ramp from Ϫ200 to 160 mV. Cg was determined for each cycle of the sin wave. The Cg-V relationships were ﬁt with the derivative of Boltzmann functions: Cg ϭ A*z((1 ϩ eϪz(V Ϫ Vh)/kT)/(kTez(V Ϫ Vh)/kT))2 over voltage intervals where most channels are closed (0 Ca, Ϫ160 to 100 mV; 70 Ca, Ϫ160 to Ϫ10 mV). The 0 Ca2ϩ data were ﬁt ﬁrst (A ϭ 1,390, z ϭ 0.61 e, Vh ϭ 108 mV) and the 70 Ca2ϩ data were ﬁt with identical amplitude and charge (A, z) while Vh was reduced to 75 mV.

steady-state charge movement, respectively. Time-deriv-
atives of the ﬁts to Qp superimpose with IgON (Fig. 5 D) demonstrating that Ig kinetics reﬂect large slow components of ON charge movement.
Slow charge movement is evident as a distinct component of IgON in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (dashed line – Fig. 5 D) but not in 0 Ca2ϩ because its time constant (␶gSLOW) is decreased from 4.2 ms in 0 Ca2ϩ to 0.85 ms in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ
(Fig. 5 C). This ﬁvefold change in kinetics produces a
ﬁvefold increase in slow gating current amplitude in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. The marked Ca2ϩ-sensitivity of ␶gSLOW is consistent with the ability of Ca2ϩ to speed IK activation (Fig. 4 A).

The Voltage Dependence of Slow Gating Charge Movement in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ
The properties of slow charge movement in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ are examined in more detail in Fig. 6. Families of Ig evoked after pulses of different duration to various voltages are shown in Fig. 6 A. Time courses of ON charge movement (Qp) determined from these data are plotted in Fig. 6 B and ﬁt with double exponential functions. The time constant of the slow component is plotted against voltage in Fig. 6 C together with ␶gSLOW at negative voltages, determined from the slow component of OFF charge movement (Horrigan and Aldrich,

277 Horrigan and Aldrich

1999) (see also Fig. 13 C). Also shown are the mean time constants of IK relaxation (␶[IK]) in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. At both positive and negative voltages the voltage dependencies of ␶gSLOW and ␶(IK) are identical (Fig. 6 C, compare solid and dashed lines), supporting the idea that slow charge movement is limited by channel opening. However, ␶gSLOW is approximately fourfold slower than ␶(IK) at positive voltages and twofold slower at negative voltages. Differences between ␶(IK) and ␶gSLOW were also reported previously in 0 Ca2ϩ and may reﬂect the different ionic conditions used to measure IK and Ig (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999).
Ca2ϩ Alters the Relationship between Q-V and G-V
The QP-V curves in Fig. 6 D compare the voltage dependence of charge movement for pulses of different duration (from Fig. 6 B). The Q-V determined with brief 0.25 ms pulses (Qp(0.25)) reﬂects fast charge movement. The voltage dependence of fast charge movement was also determined over a wider voltage range by integrating the fast component of IgON (Qfast, Fig. 6 D) (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999). The steady-state QSS-V relationship determined with a 20 ms pulse (Qp(20), Fig. 6 D) is steeper and shifted to more negative voltages than Qfast-V. This difference reﬂects the voltage dependence of slow charge movement and contrasts with results in 0 Ca2ϩ where QSS-V and Qfast-V curves are similar in shape (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999).
The steady-state Q-V and G-V relationships in 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ are compared in Fig. 6 E and indicate that Ca2ϩ-binding changes the relationship between charge movement and open probability. In 0 Ca2ϩ the Q-V is shallower and activates at more negative voltages than the G-V, exhibiting an approximate fourth-power relationship between the two, as in many voltage-dependent channels (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999). In 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, however, the Q-V and G-V almost superimpose. Calcium has changed the coupling between charge movement and channel opening so that less charge moves, on average, at voltages where most channels are closed. That is, Ca2ϩ allows channels to open when fewer voltage sensors have been activated.
The Effects of Ca2ϩ on Voltage Sensor Activation
To determine whether Ca2ϩ affects voltage sensor activation directly, we compared the fast components of gating charge movement in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ (Fig. 7). This analysis shows that the interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor activation is weak.
Because voltage sensor movement in BK channels is rapid compared with channel opening and closing, the fast component of ON or OFF gating current (Igfast) assays voltage sensor movement while channels remain in either a closed or open conformation (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999) corresponding to sub-Schemes IIe and

IIf, respectively (Fig. 3). For example, IK activates with a delay of ‫ف‬100 ␮s after a voltage step (0 Ca2ϩ, 20ЊC) (Horrigan et al., 1999). During this period, Ig reﬂects voltage sensor activation while channels are closed. If voltage sensor activation is a two state process as in Scheme II, then the initial decay of Ig should be exponential, reﬂecting the R to A transition (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999). Therefore, Igfast at positive voltages was isolated by ﬁtting the ﬁrst 100 ␮s of IgON with an exponential function (Fig. 7, A and B, dashed lines). Because channels are closed, the Ca2ϩ dependence of Igfast must reﬂect a direct interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor movement that is independent of the ability of Ca2ϩ to alter channel opening.
Ca2ϩIncreases the Equilibrium Constant for Voltage Sensor Activation
The amount of fast charge movement (Qfast) was estimated by integrating the area under the exponential ﬁt to Igfast, corresponding to the shaded regions in Fig. 7, A and B. Normalized Qfast (mean Ϯ SEM) is plotted against voltage on linear and log scales in Fig. 7, C and D, respectively for 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. The mean half-activation voltage (ϽVh(Qfast)Ͼ) determined by ﬁtting Boltzmann functions to individual Q-V records was shifted by Ϫ20 mV from 155 Ϯ 7 mV in 0 Ca2ϩ (n ϭ 10) to 135 Ϯ 8 mV in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (n ϭ 8), whereas the shape of the curves represented by the voltage sensor charge zJ was not appreciably altered (0 Ca2ϩ: zJ ϭ 0.59 Ϯ 0.03 e; 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ: zJ ϭ 0.57 Ϯ 0.03 e).
Because of the considerable patch-to-patch variation in Vh(Qfast), individual Qfast-V curves were aligned to the mean half-activation voltage in 0 or 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ before averaging (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999)(see materials and methods). The resulting plots (Fig. 7, C and D) are well ﬁt by Boltzmann functions (solid lines) with identical valence (0.58 e) but different half-activation voltages, implying a small increase in the equilibrium constant for voltage sensor activation upon Ca2ϩ binding, as predicted by Scheme II when E Ͼ 1. The good ﬁt by Boltzmann functions is also consistent with the assumption that voltage sensor activation can be described by a single R-A transition and that voltage sensors act independently when channels are closed.
Ca2ϩ Slows Voltage Sensor Deactivation
The kinetics of fast charge movement are altered slightly by Ca2ϩ, consistent with a small increase in the equilibrium constant for voltage sensor activation. The mean Igfast time constants (␶gfast) from Fig. 7, A and B, and similar experiments are plotted versus voltage in Fig. 7 E. At negative voltages, ␶gfast was determined by ﬁtting the fast component of IgOFF evoked after brief pulses (0.06–0.25 ms) that activate voltage sensors while most channels remain closed. The ␶gfast-V rela-

tionships were ﬁt (Fig. 7 E, solid lines) with bellshaped functions ␶gfast ϭ (␣ ϩ ␤)Ϫ1 as predicted for a two-state model of voltage sensor activation where ␣ ϭ ␣0exp(Ϫz␣/kT) and ␤ ϭ ␤0exp(Ϫz␤/kT) represent the forward and backward rate constants for voltage
sensor activation when channels are closed. The par-
tial charges associated with these rate constants (z␣, z␤) were determined from the best ﬁt to the 0 Ca2ϩdata when zL ϭ |z␣| ϩ |z␤| was constrained to 0.55 e (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999). Attempts to constrain zL ϭ 0.58 e as for the Qfast-V ﬁts produced ␶gfast-V ﬁts that were too steep (unpublished data). Ca2ϩ shifts the peak of the ␶gfast-V ﬁt by Ϫ20 mV, consistent with the shift in Qfast-V. Ca2ϩ mainly reduces the backward rate for voltage sensor activation, and therefore increases ␶gfast at negative voltages, but has little effect on ␶gfast at positive voltages where the forward rate predominates
(e.g., Fig. 7, A and B, at 160 mV).
279 Horrigan and Aldrich

Quantifying the Interaction between Ca2ϩ-binding and Voltage Sensor Activation
Fig. 7, A–E, show that Ca2ϩ has a small direct effect on voltage sensor movement. However, Qfast-V relationships in 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ were rarely obtained from the same patch because Ig is small and extensive signal averaging was required. Thus, the change in mean Vh(Qfast) (⌬ϽVh(Qfast)Ͼ ϭ (ϽVh(Qfast)[0 Ca]Ͼ Ϫ ϽVh(Qfast)[70 Ca]Ͼ) ϭ 20 mV) may not represent accurately the Qfast-V shift in individual experiments.
A more accurate estimate of the Qfast-V shift (Ϫ33 mV) was obtained using admittance analysis. Admittance analysis provides an alternative method for selectively measuring fast gating charge movement (Fernandez et al., 1982). When the membrane is clamped with a sinusoidal voltage command, a nonlinear gating capacitance (Cg) proportional to dQfast/dV

can be determined (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999) (see
materials and methods). This technique provides a rapid assay of Qfast(V) such that the effects of 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ can be compared in the same patch. Fig. 7 F shows the Cg-V relationship is altered by Ca2ϩ. To estimate the Qfast-V relationships for closed channels, the Cg-V traces were ﬁt by the derivative of Boltzmann functions with respect to voltage over a voltage
range where PO is small (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999). The 0 Ca2ϩ ﬁt determined for V Ͻ 100 mV (solid line) was shifted along the voltage-axis by Ϫ32 mV to ﬁt the 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ data from the same patch for V Ͻ Ϫ10
mV. Similar analysis in several different experiments indicate a mean Qfast-V shift of Ϫ33 Ϯ 4 mV (mean Ϯ SEM, n ϭ 6).

The Energetic Relationship between Ca2ϩ-binding and Voltage Sensor Activation

A Ϫ33 mV shift in Qfast(V) upon Ca2ϩ binding can be accounted for by Scheme II if the allosteric factor E is assigned a value of 2.1 (zJ ϭ 0.58 e). Thus, Ca2ϩ-binding increases the R-A equilibrium constant 2.1-fold, altering
the energetics of voltage sensor activation by 0.45 kcal
mole. This represents a lower limit for the interaction energy because 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ may not be sufﬁcient to completely saturate Ca2ϩ binding sites and the saturat-
ing shift in Qfast(V) may therefore be underestimated.

Effects of Ca2ϩ on Voltage Sensor Activation Cannot Account for the Shift in PO-V

To determine whether the Ca2ϩ-dependent shift in
the half-activation voltage of the PO-V relationship (⌬Vh[PO]) can be accounted for by an effect of Ca2ϩ on voltage sensor activation, we examined the behavior of
Scheme II when there is no direct interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and channel opening (i.e., C ϭ 1). If we set E ϭ 2.1 to account for the Ϫ33 mV shift in the Qfast-V relationship produced by 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ then the model predicts ⌬Vh(PO) ϭ Ϫ19 mV, only 11% of the observed value (⌬Vh[PO] ϭ Ϫ166 mV, Fig. 4 C). Even if E is inﬁnite, Scheme II cannot reproduce a Ϫ166 mV shift when C ϭ 1. If E is large then Ca2ϩ binding will ef-
fectively lock voltage sensors in the activated conformation (i.e., JE ϾϾ 1) such that in saturating [Ca2ϩ] the
channel can only occupy a single closed and open state with a C-O equilibrium constant of LC4D4, hence:

VhEϰ (PO) represents, for any zL, L0,D, and C in saturating Ca2ϩ, the lower limit of Vh(PO) as E becomes large.

Given the parameters (zL, L0,D) used previously (0.4 e, 2 ϫ 10Ϫ6, 17) (Horrigan et al., 1999) or in the present study (0.3 e, 0.98 ϫ 10Ϫ6, 25), Eq. 2 predicts VhEϰ (PO) ϭ 81 or 113 mV, respectively, when C ϭ 1 as compared with the observed Vh(PO) ϭ 20 Ϯ 8 mV in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. Thus, interaction of Ca2ϩ binding with voltage sensor activation is insufﬁcient to account for the observed ⌬Vh(PO), even if E is large. We conclude that Ca2ϩ binding must affect the C-O transition directly (i.e., C Ͼ 1).
Effects of Ca2ϩ on the C-O Transition
The weak Ca2ϩ-sensitivity of fast charge movement and data presented in Figs. 8 and 9 show that the primary mechanism of Ca2ϩ action involves direct interaction between Ca2ϩ-binding and the C-O transition.
The ability of Ca2ϩ to speed IK activation, slow deactivation, increase open probability (Fig. 4), and produce analogous effects on the kinetics and amplitude of slow charge movement (Figs. 5 and 6) are consistent with Ca2ϩ causing a change in the rate-limiting C-O transition. However, Ca2ϩ may alter this transition through two different pathways: a direct interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and channel opening (Fig. 8 A, solid arrow) (C-factor), or an indirect interaction (Fig. 8 A, dashed arrows) involving a Ca2ϩ-dependent increase in voltage sensor activation (E-factor) that, in turn, promotes channel opening (D-factor). To isolate the direct interaction we measured open probability (PO) at very negative voltages in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ.
Ca2ϩ Increases PO when Voltage Sensors Are Not Activated
At sufﬁciently negative voltages, voltage sensors should remain in the resting (R) state even when Ca2ϩ is bound. The Qfast-V relationships in Fig. 7, C and D, show that the fraction of activated voltage sensors is small (Ͻ10Ϫ2) for V Ͻ 0 mV in 0 or 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. With voltage sensors effectively locked in the R conformation, Scheme II reduces to sub-Scheme IIc (Fig. 3), which speciﬁes a 10 state Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC)-type gating scheme (Fig. 8 B, sub-Scheme IIc*). Under this extreme condition, channels can open in a Ca2ϩ-dependent manner only through direct interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and the C-O transition. At negative voltages PO is highly Ca2ϩ sensitive (Figs. 8 and 9), conﬁrming that a strong interaction exists between Ca2ϩ binding and channel opening and providing a direct estimate of the allosteric factor C that embodies this interaction.
Fig. 8 C compares IK recorded at Ϫ120 mV from a single patch in various [Ca2ϩ]. The corresponding amplitude histograms are superimposed in Fig. 8 D. Although the patch contains hundreds of mSlo1 channels, PO is low in the absence of Ca2ϩ and activity is observed as the infrequent and brief opening of single channels.

Data for PO Ͻ 10Ϫ2 were obtained from amplitude histograms as in A but were ﬁltered at 5 kHz such that openings near the Kϩ reversal potential could
be distinguished from noise based on a half-amplitude criterion (see materials and methods). The data were ﬁt (solid lines) by Scheme

(C) A dose-response relationship for the effect of Ca2ϩon PO at negative voltages is obtained by plotting the log-ratio of NPO in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ (log[Ro]) versus [Ca2ϩ] for several experiments (symbols). NPO(V) was determined from exponential ﬁts to the data with z ϭ 0.3 e as in A. Log(RO) from A (᭹) spans the entire [Ca2ϩ] range and is ﬁt (dashed line) by Eq. 4 (C ϭ 7.8, KD ϭ 8.2 ␮M). (D) The mean log(RO)-[Ca2ϩ] relationship is ﬁt (solid line) by Eq. 4 (C ϭ 7.4, KD ϭ 9.3 ␮M) and compared with the half activation voltage (Vh) of PO (open symbols). Solid lines in C and D represent predictions of Scheme II for log(RO) and VH(PO), respectively, using the Fit B parameters in Table II (C ϭ 8, KD ϭ 11 ␮M; Table II, Fit B). The change in VH(PO) from 100–1,000 ␮M Ca2ϩ can be reproduced (dotted line) if Scheme II is modiﬁed to include an additional low af-
ﬁnity binding site in each subunit that interacts with the C-O transition through an allosteric mechanism analogous to that embodied by
the C-factor in Scheme II. The parameters for the low afﬁnity site (KDLow ϭ 2.33 mM, CLow ϭ 3.53) were taken from Zhang et al. (2001). However, this model predicts a marked increase of RO in 100–1,000 ␮M Ca2ϩ (dashed line) that is inconsistent with the data.

Application of Ca2ϩ causes a large increase in open
probability, resulting in multichannel openings. NPO increases 2,130-fold, from 6.1 ϫ 10Ϫ4 in 0 Ca2ϩ to 1.3 in 100 ␮M Ca2ϩ. Histograms in Fig. 8 E demonstrate for a different patch at Ϫ160 mV that the increase in NPO saturates above 100 ␮M Ca2ϩ.
To characterize the interaction between Ca2ϩ-bind-
ing and channel opening in detail, and to conﬁrm that
the PO increase in Fig. 8 C can be described by subScheme IIc, channel activity was measured over a range of negative voltages and [Ca2ϩ]. Fig. 9 A plots NPO versus voltage for the patch in Fig. 8 C at many [Ca2ϩ].
The NPO-V relations become weakly voltage dependent at negative potentials, consistent with the assumption
that voltage sensors are not activated under these con-

ditions (Horrigan et al., 1999). This limiting behavior is
also seen in Fig. 9 B, which plots log(PO) over a wider voltage range at different [Ca2ϩ] from many experiments (mean Ϯ SEM).
Fig. 9, A and B, show that PO increases Ͼ1,000-fold in response to Ca2ϩ at negative potentials. Thus Ca2ϩ
binding strongly affects channel opening through a
pathway that does not involve voltage sensor activation.
Sub-Scheme IIc predicts:

--------------L----(---1----+-----K----C-----)--4-------------L(1 + KC)4 + (1 + K)4

.

Because PO at extreme negative voltages is small (Ͻ10Ϫ2), even in saturating [Ca2ϩ], this expression can
be approximated:

Since the C-O equilibrium constant (L) is the only
voltage-dependent parameter in sub-Scheme IIc, the
voltage dependence of PO should be identical to that of L and independent of [Ca2ϩ]. Consistent with this
prediction, the NPO-V relations in Fig. 9 A at all [Ca2ϩ] can be ﬁt reasonably by exponential func-
tions (dashed lines) with identical voltage dependen-
cies (e-fold per 84 mV) reﬂecting the partial charge of L (zL ϭ 0.3 e).

Determining the Parameters Associated with Ca2ϩ-dependent Activation (KD, C)
The parameters that deﬁne sub-Scheme IIc (L, KD, C) are well determined by the properties of PO at extreme negative voltages. L can be measured directly in 0 Ca2ϩ where Eq. 3 reduces to PO ϭ L. Then KD and C can be determined from the Ca2ϩ dependence of PO (Eq. 3). However, for some experiments (e.g., Fig. 9 A), PO could not be determined because macroscopic currents were large and the number of channels in the patch (N) could not be estimated accurately. Errors in the estimation of N in other experiments may contribute to the variability in PO at negative voltages in Fig. 9 B. Therefore, to evaluate KD and C independent of N, we determined the ratio (RO) of NPO in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ where (based on Eq. 3):

R0([Ca2ϩ]) = -N----P---N-0---[-P-V---0-,-[-[--VC---,--a0---2-]-ϩ----]--]-

RO is independent of L as well as N and therefore depends only on Ca2ϩ binding (KD) and its interaction
with channel opening (C). Fig. 9 C plots RO on a log scale versus [Ca2ϩ] for sev-
eral experiments. RO is highly reproducible and well
ﬁt by Eq. 4 (solid line). According to Eq. 4, RO increases from a minimum of 1 in 0 Ca2ϩ to a maximum of C4 in saturating Ca2ϩ([Ca2ϩ]sat). Thus, C can be determined from the saturating value of RO (C ϭ [RO([Ca2ϩ]sat)]Ϫ4). The dashed line in Fig. 9 C is the ﬁt (C ϭ 7.8 Ϯ 0.1, KD ϭ 8.2 Ϯ 0.5 ␮M) to the data from
Fig. 9 A (solid symbols), representing the only single experiment to span the entire [Ca2ϩ] range. A solid
line represents the parameters used in the ﬁnal model
(C ϭ 8, KD ϭ 11 ␮M). The best ﬁt to mean log(RO) yielded C ϭ 7.4 Ϯ 0.1 and KD ϭ 9.3 Ϯ 0.4 ␮M (Fig. 9 D,
solid line).

The Energetic Relationship between Ca2ϩ Binding and Channel Opening
The ability of Ca2ϩ to increase PO at extreme negative voltages shows that Ca2ϩ binding affects channel opening directly and provides an estimate of the interaction energy between these two processes. A C-fold increase in C-O equilibrium constant where C ϭ 8 indicates that the free energy difference between closed and open increases 1.25 kcal molϪ1 for each Ca2ϩ bound (⌬⌬GCO ϭ 0.6 ln[C]) or 5.0 kcal molϪ1 for the Ca2ϩ-saturated condition.
The Ca2ϩ Dependence of Vh(PO)
Another measure of BK channel gating commonly used to characterize Ca2ϩ sensitivity is the half-activation voltage of the PO-V relationship (Vh[PO]) (Moczydlowski and Latorre, 1983). Fig. 9 D plots mean values of Vh(PO) and log(RO) against [Ca2ϩ]. For certain gating schemes, a simple relationship between Vh(PO) and log(RO) is expected. For instance, a voltage-dependent MWC scheme (sub-Scheme IIc) predicts ⌬Vh(PO[Ca2ϩ]) ϭ Ϫ(kT/zL) ln(RO) where ⌬Vh(PO[Ca2ϩ]) ϭ Vh(PO[Ca2ϩ]) Ϫ Vh(PO[0]). That is, changes in Vh(PO) and log(RO) should be directly proportional. However, this prediction is not generally valid for Scheme II. And, although the two doseresponse curves in Fig. 9 D are similar in shape, differences are evident. First, Vh(PO) is more Ca2ϩ-sensitive than log(RO). That is, when the two curves are scaled as in Fig. 9 D to give identical Y-axis excursions between 0 and 100 ␮M Ca2ϩ, Vh(PO)-[Ca2ϩ] is left-shifted relative to log(RO)-[Ca2ϩ]. Such a difference is predicted by Scheme II (Fig. 9 D, solid line) because Vh(PO), unlike RO, is measured under conditions where voltage sensors are activated, thereby producing an E-fold increase in Ca2ϩafﬁnity. Another difference between the doseresponse curves in Fig. 9 D is that log(RO) saturates for [Ca2ϩ] Ն 100 ␮M, as predicted by Eq. 4, whereas Vh(PO) has a biphasic appearance, beginning to saturate around 100 ␮M Ca2ϩ but continuing to change by more than 30 mV between 100 and 1,000 ␮M Ca2ϩ. The failure of Vh(PO) to saturate has been noted previously (Moczydlowski and Latorre, 1983; Cox et al., 1997a; Cui et al., 1997; Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997) and can be accounted for by the action of Ca2ϩ at distinct high afﬁnity (micromolar) and low afﬁnity (millimolar) binding sites (dotted line Fig. 9 D) (Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001).
The apparent saturation of log(RO) in 100–1,000 ␮M Ca2ϩ is consistent with RO reﬂecting the action of Ca2ϩ at high afﬁnity binding sites. The differential effect of 100–1,000 ␮M Ca2ϩ on Vh(PO) and log(RO) has implications for the mechanism of Ca2ϩ action at low afﬁnity binding sites that will be discussed below.

nels illustrate the changes in equilibria induced by Ca2ϩ binding. By increasing the C-O equilibrium constants Ca2ϩ has
the effect of changing the primary acti-
vation pathway, accounting in part for
the altered relationship between Q-V
and G-V.

Scheme II Reproduces the Ca2ϩ and Voltage Dependence of PO
Thus far we have examined the gating of mSlo1 channels under extreme conditions to isolate interactions involved in Ca2ϩ-dependent activation and to test a general allosteric gating mechanism (Scheme II). Our results show that the interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and channel opening is strong and independent of voltage sensor activation. The interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor activation is weak and independent of channel opening.
Together with previous analysis of the voltage-dependent gating of unliganded channels (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999) these results support Scheme II. However, an important test of the model is its ability to describe the combined effects of Ca2ϩ and voltage over a broad range of conditions. In general, the Ca2ϩ and voltage dependence of PO will depend on all the parameters in Scheme II (Eq. 1). Thus, by ﬁtting PO(V,[Ca2ϩ]) it is theoretically possible to test the model
283 Horrigan and Aldrich

and deﬁne its parameters. Excellent ﬁts to the PO-V relationships for [Ca2ϩ] Յ 100 ␮M were obtained (Fig. 10 A) when L0 and zL were set to 2 ϫ 10Ϫ6 and 0.4 e, respectively, based on previous estimates (Horrigan et al.,
1999) and all other parameters were allowed to vary (Ta-
ble II, Fit A). However several parameters in addition to
L0 and zL are poorly constrained by this procedure and the ability of Eq. 1 to ﬁt PO is an inadequate test of Scheme II. Although the values of zJ (0.55 e), Vh(J) (154 mV), and D (18.4) obtained from the ﬁt are similar to those estimated previously from 0 Ca2ϩ data (zJ ϭ 0.55 e, Vh(J) ϭ 145 mV, and D ϭ 17) (Horrigan et al., 1999), the values of C (2.4) and KD (32 ␮M) are inconsistent with the log(RO)-[Ca2ϩ] relationship (Fig. 10 B, Fit A). And the value of E (31) predicts a Ϫ158 mV shift in the QFast-V relationship upon Ca2ϩ binding, much larger than the observed Ϫ33 mV shift in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ.
One reason why the PO ﬁt fails to constrain L0, zL, C, KD is that it places little weight on the data at extreme negative voltages where PO is small. These parameters

are better constrained by ﬁtting log(PO). Obviously the ﬁt also excludes information available from gating cur-

rents. The ﬁnal parameters assigned to Scheme II (Table II, Fit B) are a compromise determined by constraining many of the parameters within a restricted range and then ﬁtting both PO and log(PO) simultaneously in an attempt to weigh equally the data at extreme negative voltage and near Vh(PO). Fig. 10 C plots PO (Fig. 10 C1) and log(PO) (Fig. 10 C2) together with the predictions of Scheme II (lines). The parameters were restricted as follows:

on a ﬁt to the RO-[Ca2ϩ] data where C was ﬁxed and KD
allowed to vary (Fig. 9 C). C was chosen as the maximum
value judged consistent with the amplitude range of RO
because higher C consistently produced better ﬁts to PO(V,[Ca2ϩ]) by least-squares criteria. In addition, since C and E both contribute to the Ca2ϩ-dependent shift in
Vh(PO), higher values of C allowed E to be reduced to a
value (2.4) consistent with gating current measurements
(see below). Allowing KD to vary during the PO-V ﬁts consistently produced higher values (15–16 ␮M) than indicated by the RO-[Ca2ϩ] data (11 ␮M). This may reﬂect the contribution of low afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding sites esti-
mated by Zhang et al. (2001) to shift Vh(PO) by Ϫ7 mV in 100 ␮M Ca2ϩ. When PO-V data in 100, 70, 21, and 10 ␮M Ca2ϩ were shifted by Ϫ7, Ϫ5, Ϫ2, Ϫ1 mV to correct

binding and channel opening is sufﬁcient to account for the Ca2ϩ-dependent shift in Vh(PO) (Fig. 9 D).
We also attempted to ﬁt the data with E ϭ 1 (Table II,
Fit C) to determine whether weak interaction between Ca2ϩ binding sites and voltage sensors is necessary for ob-
taining an adequate ﬁt. In this case, increasing C from 8 to 11 was sufﬁcient to reproduce the Ca2ϩ-dependent shift
in Vh(PO) (unpublished data). However, such an increase in C is inconsistent with the Ca2ϩ dependence of RO, predicting a larger increase in RO than is actually observed (Fig. 10 B, Fit C). Thus, a small but signiﬁcant interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor activation is required to account for the Ca2ϩ dependence of PO.
The parameters used to ﬁt steady-state PO (Table II, Fit B) also account for the change in shape and shift of
the steady-state Q-V relation along the voltage axis in response to 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ as shown in Fig. 10 D. Ca2ϩ al-

Thus, the predominant activation pathway is altered by Ca2ϩ as illustrated in Fig. 10 E.

(C) A double pulse experiment in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ shows that peak Ig evoked by the second pulse (P2) is larger than that evoked by the ﬁrst pulse (P1) when the interpulse interval is brief. This behavior is consistent with the predicted difference between QC and QO as illustrated by the numbered arrows in (D) corresponding to the pulse intervals in C.

The ﬁrst prediction cannot be tested directly because we observe the binding of Ca2ϩ indirectly via its effects on channel function. As discussed later, the differential sensitivity of ␶(IK) to Ca2ϩ observed at extreme positive and negative voltages is consistent with an increase in Ca2ϩ binding afﬁnity upon channel opening. Technical factors prevent detailed comparison of gating charge movement in open versus closed channels. However several lines of evidence (below) conﬁrm that channel opening affects voltage sensor movement in a manner predicted by Scheme II.
Channel Opening Promotes Voltage Sensor Activation
The change in relationship between QSS-V and PO-V (Fig. 10 D) reﬂects in large part a marked steepening of QSS-V in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. This increase in apparent voltage dependence seems surprising given that the shape of the PO-V and Qfast-V relationships are relatively unaf-
285 Horrigan and Aldrich

fected by Ca2ϩ (Figs. 4 C2 and 7 C). However, the steepening of QSS-V is explained by the change in voltage sensor activation that is predicted to accompany chan-
nel opening.
According to Scheme II, the steady-state charge dis-
tribution for closed channels (QC; approximated by Qfast in Fig. 7) is determined by the R-A equilibrium constant (J in 0 Ca2ϩ; JE in saturating Ca2ϩ) and by the
charge associated with voltage sensor activation (zJ):

in 0 Ca2ϩ:

QC = 4zJ

-----J----1+J

in saturating Ca2ϩ:

QC = 4zJ

-----J---E------1 + JE

When channels open, charge associated with the C-O transition (zL) moves and the R-A equilibrium constant increases D-fold, producing an open channel charge distribution:

in 0 Ca2ϩ: in saturating Ca2ϩ:

QO = zL + 4zJ

-----D-----J----1 + DJ

increases signiﬁcantly during P2. A maximal increase in
peak IgON of 55% is observed together with a 43% increase in Qfast using an interpulse interval of 0.5 ms.
The increase in Qfast observed during the second pulse can be understood in terms of the relationship

Channel opening increases the R-A equilibrium con-
stant, thus shifting the QO-V to more negative voltages than QC-V with little change in shape (Fig. 11, A and B).
The steady-state charge distribution (QSS) can be expressed in general as a sum of QC and QO, weighted by open probability:

between QO and QC illustrated in Fig. 11 D. Initially, channels are closed at Ϫ80 mV, so Qfast during P1 is determined by the voltage dependence of QC, and a pulse to 120 mV moves less than half of the total charge rap-
idly (Fig. 11 D, arrow 1). However, a 5-ms pulse to 120 mV in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ is sufﬁcient to activate mSlo1 chan-

move as channels open. This slow component of QON can
be described in terms of a transition between QC and QO (Fig. 11 D, arrow 2). After P1, repolarization to Ϫ80 mV

QSS = QC
QSS deviates from QC only at high voltages where PO becomes signiﬁcant and, even then, the QSS-V relationship is only slightly steeper than QC-V (Fig. 11 A). In the presence of 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, however, the relationship between QC, QO, and PO changes (Fig. 11 B). The PO-V relation shifts to more negative voltages while QC-V and QO-V are relatively unaffected. Consequently, PO increases at voltages where QC is small (QC ϽϽ 1) and Eq. 6 can be approximated:

moves voltage sensors rapidly back to their resting state while many channels remain open (Fig. 11 D, arrow 3) and channels subsequently close. With an interpulse interval of 3 ms or more, most channels are closed at the beginning of P2, so Ig evoked by P1 and P2 are identical. However, as the interpulse interval is reduced, some channels remain open at the beginning of P2 and an increase in Qfast is observed because a step from Ϫ80 to 120 mV produces a greater increase in QO (Fig. 11 D, arrow 4) than it does in QC (arrow 1). That is, P2 evokes charge movement among open states (O-O), whereas P1 only

QSS = P0Q0

evokes charge movement among closed states (C-C). If all channels remain open and all voltage sensors are

In addition, Scheme II predicts QO will increase at more negative voltages than PO and is relatively constant over the voltage-range where PO increases most steeply. Thus QSS is roughly proportional to PO. That QSS in 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ is proportional to QC and PO respectively accounts for the marked change in shape of the QSS-V relationship upon application of Ca2ϩ.
Although the QSS-V relationship does not reveal the voltage dependence of QO in detail, the observation that QSS-V and PO-V superimpose in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (Fig. 10 D) is consistent with QO increasing over a more negative voltage range than PO, as predicted by Scheme II. Additional evidence presented below deﬁnes the QO-V relationship in more detail.

deactivated during the interpulse interval, then a 2.5-
fold increase in Qfast would be expected during P2 (Fig. 11 D, compare arrows 1 and 4). However, with a 0.5-ms
interpulse interval only 37% of channels should remain open (PO ϭ 0.375) based on IK deactivation kinetics (␶[IK] ϭ 0.51 Ϯ 0.04 ms at Ϫ80 mV). In addition, 92% of the voltage sensors will reach the resting state (PR ϭ 0.92) based on the time constant of voltage sensor deactivation in open channels (␶ ϭ 0.2 ms at Ϫ80 mV, see
Fig. 13). Therefore, a 49% increase in Qfast is predicted for P2 similar to the observed 43% increase (Qfast[P2] ϭ [QO(ϩ120) Ϫ QO(Ϫ80)] PO PR ϩ [QC(ϩ120) Ϫ QC(Ϫ80))] (1 Ϫ PO) ϭ [(2.5)(0.375)(0.92) ϩ (1 Ϫ 0.375)]Qfast[P1] ϭ 1.49 Qfast[P1]).

Thus, in theory, QO can be determined in a modelindependent manner at any voltage and [Ca2ϩ] by mea-
suring PO and QC (i.e., Qfast). However, several experimental factors limit the conditions under which Eq. 10
can be evaluated accurately. First, at high voltages and/ or [Ca2ϩ] the PO of BK channels approaches unity (Rothberg and Magleby, 2000), such that the ﬁrst term
of Eq. 10 becomes large and sensitive to errors in PO. That our experiments measure normalized open prob-
ability (PO/POMAX) rather than absolute PO introduces an additional systematic error when PO approaches POMAX. Second, the method of estimating QC is model dependent. The voltage dependence of QC can be determined from the Qfast-V relationship (Fig. 7), if we assume, as in Scheme II, that Qfast represents the movement of four independent and identical voltage sen-
sors. In this case the maximal amplitude of QC is 4zJ, where zJ, the voltage sensor charge, can be determined by ﬁtting the Qfast-V relationship to the Boltzmann distribution.
QO can be determined in a model-independent manner that is insensitive to the use of normalized PO if we restrict our analysis to conditions where both PO and QC are small. If PO ϽϽ 1, Eq. 10 reduces to:

According to Scheme II, QO should increase to roughly half of its maximal value before QC or PO become signiﬁcant (i.e., Ͼ10Ϫ1)(see Fig. 11, A and B). Thus, over
a range of negative voltages, the QO-V relationship can be determined solely from the voltage dependence of
PO. Since Eq. 11 is insensitive to the scaling of PO, normalized PO or NPO can be used without introducing additional errors. Since Eq. 11 is independent of QC, evaluation of QO is not restricted to those [Ca2ϩ] where gating currents have been measured.
Fig. 12 A plots ϽqaϾ determined from mean PO in 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (Fig. 9 B). The ϽqaϾ-V relations are bell-shaped and are expected to approximate the QO-V relation only at negative voltages where QC and PO are small and Eq. 11 is valid (i.e., V Ͻ ‫ف‬0 in 0 Ca2ϩ, V Ͻ Ϫ50 in 70 ␮M Ca). The QO-V relationships are estimated (Fig. 12 A, solid lines) by ﬁtting the foot of the ϽqaϾ-V curves with functions of the form:

Q0 = q0 + q1B[V],

(12)

is a Boltzmann func-

tion characterized by a half-activation voltage (Vh) and gating valence (z), whereas q0 and q1 represent the amplitudes of the voltage-independent and voltage-depen-

dent components of QO, respectively. The prediction of Scheme II (Eq. 5) can be expressed in terms of Eq. 12

when q0 ϭ zL, q1 ϭ 4zJ, z ϭ zJ and Vh ϭ (kT/zJ)ln(DJ0) in 0 Ca2ϩ or Vh ϭ (kT/zJ)ln(DEJ0) in saturating Ca2ϩ.
ϽqaϾ is very sensitive to experimental discontinuities in
the PO-V relationship. Consequently, increased variation in ϽqaϾ is observed near the potassium reversal potential
(0 mV), where PO was not measured, and near the peak of the ϽqaϾ-V relationship corresponding to the transi-
tion between microscopic and macroscopic PO measure-
ments. These local regions of increased variability can

strongly inﬂuence QO-V ﬁts, especially the estimated amplitude of QO (q1 in Eq. 12). Therefore, to limit the effects of local variation, the ϽqaϾ-V relationships were ﬁt ﬁrst with approximating functions (Fig. 12, A and

B, dashed lines) to provide smoothly varying curves

through the data. The QO-V relationships were then determined from the foot of these curves rather than from

individual data points. The approximating functions

represent the derivative with respect to voltage of ﬁts to

the mean log(PO)-V data (Fig. 9 B, solid lines) using a 10-state gating scheme (Scheme I*, Fig. 1 B) where all

the parameters (L0, zL, J0, zJ, D) were allowed to vary freely at each [Ca2ϩ]. In this case, Scheme I was used

simply to reproduce the shapes of the log(PO)-V and ϽqaϾ-V relations; the parameters have no mechanistic
meaning. Although ﬁts produced in this way appear to

be excellent, it is possible that the use of a particular ap-

proximating function biases the QO-V ﬁts. Similar QO-V curves were obtained when the approximation func-

tion was determined by smoothing spline interpolation

(Reinsch, 1967)(unpublished data). However, this alter-

native method required subjective adjustment of smooth-

ing parameters at each [Ca2ϩ], thus ﬁts to Scheme I*

based on least squares criteria were more consistent.

QO Conﬁrms That Channel Opening and Ca2ϩ Binding Increase the Voltage Sensor Equilibrium
As predicted by Scheme II, the QO-V relationship is similar in shape to the QC-V relationship but shifted to more negative voltages, consistent with an increase in the R-A equilibrium constant upon channel opening. In 0 Ca2ϩ, QO-V is characterized by a valence z ϭ 0.60 e (Fig. 12 A) indistinguishable from that estimated for the QC-V relationship (zJ ϭ 0.59 Ϯ 0.03 e, 0 Ca2ϩ; zJ ϭ 0.57 Ϯ 0.03 e, 70 Ca2ϩ). The amplitude of the voltage-dependent component of QO (q1 ϭ2.19 e, 0 Ca; q1 ϭ 2.16 e, 70 ␮M Ca) is also similar to that predicted by Scheme II (4zJ ϭ 2.32 e). Finally, Vh(QO) shifts by Ϫ43 mV in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, similar to the Ϫ33 mV shift in QC determined from admittance

288 Coupling of Voltage Sensor, Ca2ϩ Binding, and Channel Opening

analysis (Fig. 7 F). Thus, the limiting voltage dependence of PO conﬁrms that Ca2ϩ binding has a small direct effect on voltage sensor movement.
To examine further the Ca2ϩ dependence of QO, ϽqaϾ was plotted in different [Ca2ϩ] from 0 to 100 ␮M (Fig. 12 B) and QO-V was determined (solid lines) as in Fig. 12 A. The QO-V relations shift along the voltage axis in a Ca2ϩ-dependent manner while maintaining similar shapes and amplitudes. The parameters q0, q1, and z derived from the QO-V ﬁts are plotted against [Ca2ϩ] in Fig. 12 C. Mean values of each parameter are indicated by dashed lines (q0 ϭ 0.17 Ϯ 0.02, q1 ϭ 2.28 Ϯ 0.06, z ϭ 0.72 Ϯ 0.03).
Ca2ϩ Alters the Apparent Voltage Dependence of Channel Opening and Voltage Sensor Activation
Although the results in Fig. 12, A and B, are generally consistent with Scheme II, several details are not. Ca2ϩ appears to increase both the steepness of the QO-V relationship (z) and the amplitude of the voltage-independent component (q0) (Fig. 12 C). According to Scheme II these parameters, reﬂecting the voltage dependence of channel opening (zL) and voltage sensor activation (zJ), respectively, should be Ca2ϩ independent (compare Eqs. 5a and b). Below, we consider reﬁnements to Scheme II that could conceivably account for these results. However, given the possibilities for measurement error in QO and the failure of other types of data to conﬁrm a Ca-dependent change in zL or zJ, the necessity of altering Scheme II is questionable.
Z or q0 might increase with Ca2ϩ if Ca2ϩ binding sites are displaced through the membrane electric ﬁeld when mSlo1 channels change conformation. That is, Ca2ϩ ions might contribute to the gating charge associated with voltage sensor activation (zJ) or channel opening (zL). However, several lines of evidence argue against this possibility. In the case of voltage sensor activation, Qfast-V relationships in 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (Fig. 7 C) are characterized by similar valence (0.59 e, 0.57 e), indicating that zJ in closed channels is not altered by Ca2ϩ-binding. Similarly, the voltage-dependent component of QO (q1), representing the total voltage sensor charge when channels are open, is relatively unaffected by Ca2ϩ (Fig. 12 C). In the case of the C-O transition, IK kinetics appear inconsistent with a large Ca2ϩ-dependent change in zL, suggesting that q0 in low Ca2ϩ may be underestimated (see below).
Although the QO-V relationships in Fig. 12 B are similar to one another, they are derived from PO measurements that differ by three orders of magnitude (Fig. 9 B). It is conceivable that the apparent Ca2ϩ-dependence of z and q0 reﬂects systematic measurement errors correlated with a large Ca2ϩ-dependent increase in PO. Although a particular source of error is not evident, the variance of log(PO) is greatest in low Ca2ϩ and it is
289 Horrigan and Aldrich

likely that sources of error that contribute to PO in low Ca2ϩ are negligible in high Ca2ϩ. One potential source
of error in q0, evident from Fig. 12, A and B, is that the data do not in general extend to sufﬁciently negative voltages to achieve saturation of ϽqaϾ. Thus, q0 is extrapolated from a Boltzmann ﬁt to ϽqaϾ-V and is not measured directly.
A possible mechanism for the Ca2ϩ dependence of z is that Ca2ϩ binding increases the cooperativity of volt-
age sensor activation. Cooperativity could increase the
steepness of QO-V (z) without altering the total open channel charge (q1). In the extreme case that voltage sensor activation is fully cooperative (i.e., concerted), we expect z/q1 ϭ 1; in contrast, an independent mechanism such as Scheme II predicts z/q1 ϭ 0.25. Fig. 12 D plots the ratio z/q1 against [Ca2ϩ]. From 0 to 1 ␮M Ca2ϩ, z/q1 remains relatively constant with a mean value 0.28 Ϯ 0.003, consistent with an independent
mechanism (Fig. 12 D, dashed line). But z/q1 increases with [Ca2ϩ] to a maximum of 0.41. The data are ﬁt by a Hill equation (solid line) with n ϭ 1.6 and K1/2 ϭ 8.1 ␮M, similar to the KD determined from the RO-[Ca2ϩ] relationship. These results are consistent with the idea that Ca2ϩ binding increases the cooperativity of voltage
sensor activation. Cooperativity might also explain why the PO-V relationships in high Ca2ϩ tend to be steeper than predicted by Scheme II (Fig. 10 C).
The Maximum Voltage Dependence of Po Underestimates Total Gating Charge in a Ca2ϩ-dependent Manner
For channels containing a single open state, ϽqaϾ is expected to attain a maximum at limiting negative volt-
ages. This “limiting slope” indicates the total gating
charge (QT) associated with channel activation representing the sum of charges associated with voltage sen-
sor activation and channel opening (Almers, 1978; Sigg
and Bezanilla, 1997). However, in mSlo1 channels the limiting and maximal values of ϽqaϾ are different and neither provides a direct measure of QT. The limiting slope merely indicates the charge associated with the
C-O transition (zL). And QT, representing the maximum amplitude of QO, is always greater than peak ϽqaϾ (Fig. 12, A and B). Since QT must be estimated in a model-dependent manner by ﬁtting QO-V to the foot of the ϽqaϾ-V relationship it is of interest to determine to what extent peak ϽqaϾ underestimates QT. Fig. 12 E plots peak ϽqaϾ (solid symbols) determined from Fig. 12 B against [Ca2ϩ] and demonstrates that the maximal voltage dependence of PO varies with [Ca2ϩ], attaining a maximum (‫ف‬2.1 e) at intermediate [Ca2ϩ] and a minimum (‫ف‬1.5 e) at high [Ca2ϩ]. The allosteric model
(Scheme II) reproduces this behavior (Fig. 12 E, solid line) and shows that peak ϽqaϾ underestimates the value of QT in the model (dashed line, QT ϭ 4zJ ϩ zLϭ 2.62 e) by 26–44%, depending on [Ca2ϩ].

by channel closing (Slow). (E) OFF ki-
netics for all pulse durations are plotted

ponents are plotted versus pulse dura-
tion and ﬁt by exponential functions
with 1.4-ms time constants representing

Effects of Channel Opening on the Kinetics of OFF Charge Movement
The voltage and Ca2ϩ dependence of QC and QO indicate that channel opening strongly affects voltage sensor activation, whereas Ca2ϩ binding does not (i.e., D ϾϾ E in Scheme II). That 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ greatly slows the decay of IgOFF following a 1-ms pulse to 160 mV (Fig. 5 A) may appear to contradict the conclusion that direct interaction between Ca2ϩ binding sites and voltage sensors is weak. However, the Ca2ϩ-sensitivity of OFF charge movement can be understood in terms of an indirect interaction, mediated by the allosteric factors C and D in Scheme II, whereby Ca2ϩ promotes channel opening and channel opening affects voltage sensor movement.
In the presence of 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, OFF currents evoked after pulses to 160 mV decrease in amplitude and decay more slowly as pulse duration is increased (Figs. 5 B and 13 A). This phenomenon is also evident in the absence

of Ca2ϩ at more positive pulse voltages, is associated
with the time course of channel opening, and is pre-
dicted by an allosteric voltage-gating mechanism (Hor-
rigan and Aldrich, 1999). Channel opening biases the
R-A equilibrium toward the activated state, with the re-
sult that voltage sensor deactivation, and therefore OFF
charge movement, is slowed and peak IgOFF is reduced. The effect of pulse duration on IgOFF in Fig. 5 B is
more prominent in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ than in 0 Ca2ϩ because Ca2ϩ promotes channel opening. OFF currents evoked
after brief pulses, when channels remain closed, decay rapidly in the presence or absence of Ca2ϩ (Fig. 5 B) because Ca2ϩ has little direct effect on voltage sensor deactivation kinetics (Fig. 7 E, compare ␶gfast at Ϫ80 mV in 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ). The marked slowing of IgOFF in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ after a 1-ms pulse (Fig. 5 A) reﬂects that channel
opening is both more complete and more rapid in the presence of Ca2ϩ. Therefore, the effect of Ca2ϩ on IgOFF in Fig. 5 A reﬂects a difference in voltage sensor deacti-

290 Coupling of Voltage Sensor, Ca2ϩ Binding, and Channel Opening

vation for open and closed channels, rather than a direct effect of Ca2ϩ on voltage sensor movement.
Multiple Components of OFF Gating Charge Movement
The effects of channel opening on OFF charge movement in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ are examined in more detail in Fig. 13. OFF currents evoked at Ϫ80 mV following pulses to 120 mV of different duration (0.11–20 ms) are superimposed on an expanded timescale in Fig. 13 A and exhibit a slowing in the decay of IgOFF that saturates for pulses of Ն5 ms duration. The integrals of these traces (QOFF, Fig. 13 B) reveal an additional slow component of charge relaxation after prolonged depolarizations that is not obvious in the IgOFF records and requires ‫ف‬4 ms to reach a steady-state.
The kinetics of QOFF relaxation were analyzed by plotting the quantity QOFF(t)-QOFFSS on a semi-log scale (Fig. 13, C and E), where QOFFSS is the steady-state value of QOFF(t). Fig. 13 C compares OFF kinetics after the most brief (0.11 ms) and prolonged (5–20 ms) depolarizations. The 5–20-ms trace is ﬁt by a double exponential function (solid line) with time constants of 200 and 810 ␮s (dashed lines) termed “Medium” and “Slow” components. The 0.11-ms record is ﬁt by a triple-exponential function with a primary “Fast” 25-␮s component (dashed line) in addition to the 200- and 810-␮s components. Qualitatively similar results were reported previously in the absence of Ca2ϩ(Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999).
These kinetics can be understood in terms of subScheme IIb* (Fig. 13 D). A prolonged depolarization to 120 mV in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ is sufﬁcient to activate mSlo1 channels maximally. Therefore, the biexponential decay of QOFF after a 5–20-ms pulse represents the relaxation of open channels back to their resting state and is determined by voltage sensor deactivation while channels are open (O-O transitions labeled Medium in Fig. 13 D) and by channel closing (Slow). A brief depolarization is sufﬁcient to activate voltage sensors but does not allow many channels to open. Thus, the decay of QOFF after a 0.11-ms pulse is dominated by a Fast component representing the deactivation of voltage sensors while channels are closed (C-C transitions labeled Fast in Fig. 13 D).
Sub-Scheme IIb* predicts that QOFF measured after pulses of intermediate duration will be best ﬁt by a combination of all three time constants, since some channels will be open and some will be closed. Fig. 13 E shows that QOFF(t)-QOFFSS derived from the OFF currents in Fig. 13 A for all pulse durations can be ﬁt by triple-exponential functions with 25-, 200-, and 810-␮s time constants. The amplitudes of the different exponential components are plotted versus pulse duration in Fig. 13 F. The fast component increases rapidly as voltage sensors are activated and then decreases as

channels leave the closed state. At the same time, the Medium and Slow components increase in parallel reﬂecting the increased occupancy of open states. The time courses of the amplitudes of all three components are ﬁt by exponential functions with a time constant of 1.4 ms, representing the kinetics of channel opening.

The Kinetics of IK Relaxation
In response to a voltage step, IK activates or deactivates with an exponential time course after a brief delay (Fig. 4 B) (Horrigan et al., 1999). The ␶(IK)-V relationship characterizing this relaxation exhibits a complex voltage dependence. Increasing Ca2ϩ from 0 to 70 ␮M
shifts the relation with little effect on its shape (Fig. 4 D). A similar pattern is observed at intermediate [Ca2ϩ]
(Fig. 14 A). IK kinetics were characterized primarily in 0 Ca2ϩ or
high Ca2ϩ (70–100 ␮M) and the data at intermediate [Ca2ϩ] often do not include the most positive voltages. Nonetheless, trends in the behavior of ␶(IK) are evident that help to constrain the parameters in Scheme II and provide important information about the Ca2ϩand volt-
age dependence of gating. In particular, the response of ␶(IK) to Ca2ϩ at negative voltages suggests that a complex relationship exists between the Ca2ϩ- and voltage
dependence of the rate limiting C-O transition.

The Voltage Dependence of ␶(IK)
If voltage sensor activation and Ca2ϩ binding are fast and assumed to equilibrate on the timescale of channel opening, then ␶(IK) can be written (Cox et al., 1997a; Horrigan et al., 1999):

∑ τ(IK) = [ (δijpCij + γ ijpOij)]–1,

(13)

where i and j represent the number of activated voltage sensors and occupied Ca2ϩ-binding sites, respectively,
␦ij and ␥ij are forward and backward rate constants for the Cij-Oij transitions and pCij, pOij are conditional occupancies of the open and closed states (pCij ϭ p(Cij|C), pOij ϭ p(Oij|O)). Comparison of Ig and IK kinetics in 0 and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ supports the notion that
voltage sensor activation is always faster than channel
opening. The exponential relaxation of IK and the similar voltage dependence of ␶(IK) in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ are consistent with the assumption that Ca2ϩ binding is fast and that ␶(IK) is not limited by Ca2ϩ-binding transitions (Cox et al., 1997a).
The similar shape of ␶(IK)-V relations in different [Ca2ϩ] is not surprising since, in the presence or absence of Ca2ϩ, ␶(IK) is governed by voltage sensor activation and by voltage-dependent changes in the rate
constants for the C-O transition. These two processes
deﬁne four regions in the ␶(IK)-V relationship (Eqs. 14–17 below).

291 Horrigan and Aldrich

At negative voltages where forward rate constants
(␦ij) are small compared with backward rates constants (␥ij) Eq. 13 reduces to:

∑ τ(IK) = ( γ ijpOij)–1.

(14)

Conversely, at positive voltages the backward rates are small, and Eq. 13 reduces to:

∑ τ(IK) = ( δijpCij)–1.

(15)

The equilibrium constants and rate constants for the
C-O transitions vary with the number of activated volt-
age sensors. Consequently, Eqs. 14 and 15 deﬁne regions to either side of the peak in the ␶(IK)-V relationship where the voltage dependence of ␶(IK) is steepest, reﬂecting that different C-O transitions dominate IK relaxation at different voltages (Horrigan et al., 1999). At
more extreme potentials, by contrast, voltage sensor activation is saturated, and ␶(IK) reﬂects only the weak voltage dependence of the C-O rate constants (Eqs. 16
and 17 below).
At extreme negative voltages where voltage sensors are not activated (i ϭ 0, Fig. 3 sub-Scheme IIC), Eq. 14
simpliﬁes to:

∑ τN(IK) = ( γ 0jpO0j)–1.

(16)

Thus, ␶N depends only on the closing rate constants and the distribution of Ca2ϩ-bound open states. Eq. 16
is valid when voltage sensors in the open channel are
not activated and QO is therefore at a minimum. Based on Fig. 12 B, this condition is satisﬁed for all [Ca2ϩ] at voltages less than approximately Ϫ150 mV. Consistent with this prediction, ␶(IK) in all [Ca2ϩ] exhibits a similar exponential voltage dependence for V Ͻ Ϫ150
mV (Fig. 14 A), presumably reﬂecting the voltage dependence of the closing rates (␥0j). In Fig. 14 B the mean ␶(IK)-V relationships in 0, 1, and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ are ﬁt (dashed lines) by exponential functions ( τN = exp (zNV ⁄ kT) ) from Ϫ300 to Ϫ150 mV. The exponential voltage dependence of ␶N was shown previously to extend to at least Ϫ500 mV in 0 Ca2ϩ (Horri-
gan et al., 1999). The partial charges, zN, determined from ﬁts to individual ␶(IK)-V relationships are plotted versus [Ca2ϩ] in Fig. 14 C (open circles) and exhibit little Ca2ϩ-dependence, with mean values (solid circles) of Ϫ0.124 Ϯ0.003 e in 0 Ca2ϩ (n ϭ 21) and Ϫ0.145 Ϯ 0.007 e in high (70–100 ␮M) Ca2ϩ (n ϭ 5).
At extreme positive voltages, where all voltage sensors are activated (i ϭ 4, Fig. 3, sub-Scheme IID), Eq. 15
simpliﬁes to:

292 Coupling of Voltage Sensor, Ca2ϩ Binding, and Channel Opening

Thus, ␶P depends only on the opening rate constants and the distribution of Ca2ϩ-bound closed states. Eq. 17 is valid when voltage sensors in closed channels are activated such that QC is maximal. Because QC saturates at ‫ف‬250 mV (Fig. 7 C), ␶P cannot be measured over a large voltage range. Therefore, the voltage dependence of ␶P was estimated by ﬁtting the ␶(IK)-V relationships in 0, 70, and 100 ␮M Ca2ϩ with exponential functions (dashed lines Fig. 14 A) at voltages where QC is not completely saturated (Ͼ200 mV, 0 Ca2ϩ, Ͼ140 mV, 70–100 ␮M Ca2ϩ). These ﬁts are consistent with ␶(IK) at the most positive voltages and are characterized by similar partial charges in different [Ca2ϩ] (zP, Fig. 14 C), reﬂecting the charge associated with opening rate constants. However, zP may be overestimated slightly because QC is not completely saturated.
Ca2ϩ Mainly Affects Opening Rates at Limiting Negative Voltages
Fig. 14 B shows that ␶N(IK) at Ϫ150 mV increases approximately twofold as [Ca2ϩ] increases from 0 to 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, implying that the closing rate (␥0j) decreases only twofold when Ca2ϩ is bound (i.e., ␥00/␥04 ϭ 2). By contrast, PO at extreme negative voltages (Ϫ140 to Ϫ120 mV) increases ‫ف‬1,000-fold (Fig. 9 A). Therefore, the main effect of Ca2ϩ on the C-O transition at negative voltages must be to increase the forward (opening) rates.
␶(IK) Reﬂects the Differential Afﬁnities of Ca2ϩ for Open and Closed Channels
Although the change in ␶(IK) at negative voltages is small, it is remarkably Ca2ϩ sensitive. Fig. 14 B shows that 1 ␮M Ca2ϩ produces an almost maximal increase in ␶N(IK), similar to that in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. By contrast, 1 ␮M Ca2ϩ has almost no effect on ␶(IK) measured at extreme positive voltages (Fig. 14 B). The Ca2ϩ dependence of ␶(IK) depends on the C-O rate constants as well as the distribution of Ca2ϩ-bound states (Eq. 13) and therefore does not provide a direct measure of Ca2ϩ binding. However, the differential Ca2ϩ sensitivities of ␶N(IK) and ␶P(IK) are qualitatively consistent with an allosteric effect of channel opening on Ca2ϩ binding afﬁnity. ␶N(IK) depends on the distribution of Ca2ϩbound open states (Eq. 16) and should therefore reﬂect the higher Ca2ϩ afﬁnity of open channels, whereas ␶P(IK) will reﬂect the lower afﬁnity of closed channels (Eq. 17).
The Voltage Dependence of ␶N(IK) and ␶P(IK) Suggest zL Is Ca2ϩ Independent and KD Is Voltage Independent
The charge qO estimated from the limiting voltage dependence of PO increases with [Ca2ϩ] (Fig. 12 C), suggesting that bound Ca2ϩ ions may contribute to gating charge associated with the C-O equilibrium (zL) and,
293 Horrigan and Aldrich

conversely, that Ca2ϩ binding may be voltage dependent. However, the voltage dependence of ␶N(IK) and ␶P(IK) in different [Ca2ϩ] do not support these possibilities and suggest instead that qO in low Ca2ϩ may underestimate zL.
Fig. 14 C plots the partial charges (zN, zP) determined from exponential ﬁts to ␶N(IK) and ␶P(IK) at different [Ca2ϩ]. According to Eqs. 16 and 17, zN and zP reﬂect the voltage dependence of the backward and forward
rate constants, respectively, for the C-O transition. In 0 Ca2ϩ and saturating Ca2ϩ, zN and zP should be determined by single rate-constants (0 Ca2ϩ: zN ϭ z[␥00] and zP ϭ z[␦40], saturating Ca2ϩ: zN ϭ z[␥04] and zPϭz[␦40]).
Fig. 14 C shows that neither zN nor zP are strongly Ca2ϩ sensitive. zN increases in magnitude 1.16-fold from Ϫ0.124 Ϯ 0.003 e in 0 Ca2ϩ (n ϭ 21) to an average of Ϫ0.145 Ϯ 0.007 e in high (70–100 ␮M) Ca2ϩ (n ϭ 5). zP decreases 1.1-fold from 0.24 Ϯ 0.02 e (0 Ca2ϩ, nϭ12) to 0.22 Ϯ 0.005 e in high Ca2ϩ (n ϭ 6). The sum zT ϭ |zN| ϩ |zP| is identical in 0 Ca2ϩ and high Ca2ϩ (zT ϭ 0.37 e), suggesting that zL is not Ca2ϩ dependent. zT is expected to equal zL only in the simple case that the C-O transition can be represented as single energy barrier; it is
formally possible for zT to be greater or less than zL. Furthermore, zT may be overestimated if zP was not measured at sufﬁciently positive voltages. Nonetheless, the weak Ca2ϩ-sensitivity of zN, zP, and zT argue against the idea that the partial charge for channel opening (zL) depends on Ca2ϩ.
If zL is not Ca2ϩ dependent, then qO, determined from the limiting slope of PO, is probably underestimated in low Ca2ϩ. qO in high Ca2ϩ (‫ف‬0.3 e) is comparable to zT (0.37 e) and may therefore represent a reasonable estimate of zL. But qO in low Ca2ϩ (‫ف‬0.1 e) appears underestimated since it is much smaller than zT and smaller even that zN. As noted above, factors that might contribute to errors in determining qO include failure to measure PO at sufﬁciently negative voltages and large Ca2ϩ-dependent changes in the magnitude of PO. In contrast, measurements of zN and zP are less subject to these types of errors. zN, in particular, should be accurate since ␶N(IK) was routinely measured over a large voltage range (Ϫ300 to Ϫ150 mV) where voltage sensors are not activated and ␶(IK)-V is exponential. Moreover, systematic Ca2ϩ-dependent errors in the measure-
ment of zN should be small because the amplitude of ␶N(IK) changes only twofold in response to Ca2ϩ.
The Ca2ϩ and Voltage Dependence of C-O Transition Kinetics
The effects of Ca2ϩ on steady-state activation and IK kinetics superﬁcially resemble each other in that the PO-V and ␶(IK)-V relationships are shifted similarly along the voltage axis with little change in shape (Fig. 4, C
and D). Although the shift in PO-V can be reproduced by assuming Ca2ϩand voltage act almost independently

ganded, Fig. 1 B) and sub-Scheme IIb* (Ca2ϩ saturated, Fig. 4 E), respectively,
with the assumption the voltage sensors
are equilibrated (Eq. 13). Each model

equilibrium constants are deﬁned by
the steady-state parameters (Table II, Fit

ward rate constants for the C-O transitions (␥ij) determined from the ﬁts are plotted (symbols) versus the number of

ted against the C-O reaction coordinate for the unliganded (E1) and Ca2ϩ-saturated (E2) case. Solid lines represent the transition when voltage sensors are not activated (i ϭ 0). Dashed lines indicate the additive perturbations produced by activation of 1–4 voltage sensors. The relative energies of C versus O and T 1 versus T2 and the perturbations to each of these states produced by Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor activation were determined from the ﬁts in (C) using Eq. 21. The ⌬G between the open and transition states is not determined by the data and was adjusted arbitrarily.

to alter the C-O equilibrium (Scheme II), the shift in ␶(IK)-V implies that a more complex relationship exists between the Ca2ϩ and V dependence of the C-O transi-
tion kinetics. We can show that this is the case by focusing on the foot of the ␶(IK)-V relation.
As membrane potential increases at negative voltages, ␶(IK) deviates from its limiting exponential voltage dependence (␶N(V)), implying that ␶(IK) can no longer be described by Eq. 16. However, this deviation

occurs at voltages where PO is small and closing rates are presumably much greater than opening rates. Therefore, Eq. 14 should be valid. Comparing Eqs. 14 and 16, it is evident that two conditions must be satisﬁed for a deviation from exponential voltage dependence to occur. First, voltage sensors must activate so that open states other than O0j are occupied. That is, the open channel charge distribution QO must increase from its minimum level. Second, voltage sensor activa-

294 Coupling of Voltage Sensor, Ca2ϩ Binding, and Channel Opening

tion must reduce the closing rates. The voltage (VdN) where deviation from ␶N(V) occurs reﬂects both the voltage dependence of QO and the effect of voltage sensor activation on the O to C transition rates.
VdN decreases by almost 150 mV as [Ca2ϩ] increases from 0 to 70 ␮M (arrows, Fig. 14 B). This shift is not accounted for entirely by a Ca2ϩ-dependent change in voltage sensor activation, because QO shifts by only ‫ف‬40 mV over the same Ca2ϩ-range (Fig. 12 B). Therefore, the change in VdN must reﬂect a Ca2ϩ-dependent change in the sensitivity of closing rates to voltage sensor activation. To test this hypothesis, we ﬁt the ␶(IK)-V relationships in 0 Ca2ϩand 70 ␮M Ca2ϩto Scheme II (Fig. 15 A).
Ca2ϩ Alters the Sensitivity of Closing Rates to Voltage Sensor Activation
Scheme II reduces to a 10-state gating scheme containing ﬁve C-O transitions in either 0 Ca2ϩ (Scheme I*, Fig. 1 B) or saturating Ca2ϩ (sub-Scheme IIb*, Fig. 4 E). The equilibrium constants for the C-O transitions are determined by the steady-state parameters, leaving ﬁve additional kinetic parameters to specify the opening and closing rate constants. The mean ␶(IK)-V relationships in 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ are plotted in Fig. 15 A together with ﬁts to the unliganded and Ca2ϩ-saturated schemes respectively. The log closing rate constants are plotted in Fig. 15 B (symbols) against the number of voltage sensors activated (i). Similar ﬁts were obtained when the closing rates were allowed to vary freely (Fig. 15 A, dashed lines, and B, open symbols) or constrained such that opening and closing rates change monotonically with voltage sensor activation (Fig. 15 A, solid lines, and B, ﬁlled symbols).
The closing rates (Fig. 15 B) reveal a different response to voltage sensor activation in 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. In 0 Ca2ϩ, closing rates remain relatively constant until the fourth voltage sensor is activated. In 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, however, closing rates begin to decrease when one voltage sensor is activated and decrease more sharply when three or four are activated. This change in the pattern of closing rates is necessary to explain the large shift in the foot of the ␶(IK)-V relationship with Ca2ϩ. In high Ca2ϩ, VdN coincides roughly with the foot of the QO-V relationship, whereas, in 0 Ca2ϩ, VdN occurs at more positive voltages where QO has already increased substantially and several voltage sensors have been activated.
␶(IK) in Intermediate [Ca2ϩ]
␶(IK)-V relationships in intermediate [Ca2ϩ] are similar in shape to those in 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ and can also be ﬁt by 10-state gating schemes (unpublished data). However, such ﬁts are of limited value since many more than 10 states are accessible at intermediate

[Ca2ϩ]. Even with the simplifying assumption that Ca2ϩbinding and voltage sensor transitions are equilibrated, the 70-state gating scheme speciﬁed by Scheme II contains 35 C-O transitions that can inﬂuence ␶(IK). The equilibrium constants for these transitions are speciﬁed by Scheme II and constrained by the steady-state data. Yet the forward and backward rate constants are, in principal, free to vary within this constraint, adding 35 kinetic parameters.
Fitting ␶(IK) in 0 Ca2ϩ and high Ca2ϩ and at extreme voltages helps to constrain subsets of the kinetic parameters in Scheme II. Nonetheless, attempts to ﬁt the entire ␶(IK) dataset to Eq. 13 were problematic. The ␶(IK) data were not sufﬁcient to constrain the large number of free kinetic parameters. Fits often failed to converge or did not converge to unique solutions. In some cases, the model traces “oscillated” about the ␶(IK)-V plots, exhibiting periodic changes in voltage dependence caused when neighboring C-O transitions in Scheme II were assigned rate constants of different orders of magnitude (unpublished data). Such ﬁts fail to capture the gradual changes in voltage dependence that are evident in the data. This suggests that neighboring rate constants in the model are not completely free to vary but are to some extent correlated.

A Transition State Model for the C-O Conformational Change

To reduce the number of free parameters in Scheme II

and to better reproduce the voltage dependence of

␶(IK) by imposing a correlation among rate constants, we attempted to devise a model to account for the Ca2ϩ

and voltage dependence of the rate constants. It is likely

that C-O transition kinetics might be described in terms

of a simple mechanism since the steady-state data are

reproduced reasonably well by Scheme II. That is, the

effect of Ca2ϩ and voltage on the C-O equilibrium is ac-

counted for with the assumption that perturbations in

by voltage sensor activation (∆∆GCVO = –kTln[D] ) are

additive and independent (Cui and Aldrich, 2000).

Thus, a linear relationship exists between ⌬GCO and the number of bound Ca2ϩ (j) or activated voltage sensors

(i). Given this simple relationship, it seems plausible

that C-O rate constants might also be altered systemati-

cally by Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor activation.

Although perturbations in equilibria and kinetics

need not be related, simple correlations are often ob-

served for protein conformational changes, including

the opening of acetylcholine receptor channels (Gros-

man et al., 2000), the allosteric transition of hemoglo-

bin (Eaton et al., 1991; Hofrichter et al., 1991), and

protein folding reactions (Fersht, 1995). A simple ex-

ample in the case of mSlo1 is that ␶(IK) and PO both exhibit exponential voltage dependencies at extreme

negative voltages (Figs. 9 A and 14 B). Thus, a linear re-

295 Horrigan and Aldrich

lationship exists between the log closing rate constant (ln[␥]) and log C-O equilibrium constant (ln[␬]) in re-
sponse to voltage perturbation when voltage sensors
are not activated. Such relationships can be explained
in terms of transition state theory.
According to transition state theory, the C-O con-
formational change may be described as a reaction
whose kinetics are dominated by an energy barrier,
represented as a transiently occupied state (T). The
C-O equilibrium constant is determined by the free energy difference (⌬GCO) between C and O states (L = exp (–∆GCO ⁄ kT)), whereas the closing rate is determined by the difference (⌬GOT) between O and T (γ = A exp (–∆GOT ⁄ kT) ). Thus, proportional changes in ln(␥) and ln(␬) imply proportional changes in ⌬GCO and ⌬GOT (i.e., ⌬⌬GOT ϭ ⌿ ⌬⌬GCO). In the case of a voltage-dependent transition, such a rate-equilibrium linear-
free energy relationship could arise if the gating charge
moved during the O-T transition is a constant fraction of
that moved during the O-C transition. In a more general sense, proportional changes in ⌬GCO and ⌬GOT are thought to occur when the transition state has structural
features intermediate between the C and O conforma-
tions and is therefore sensitive to perturbations that af-
fect C and O (Lefﬂer, 1953; Hammond, 1955).

A Single Barrier Model Cannot Account for the Voltage Dependence of ␶(IK)

To describe the rate constants in Scheme II we ﬁrst

considered the possibility that the C-O conformational

change can be represented by a single energy barrier

with a transition state (T) and that perturbations in the

or voltage sensor activation ( ∆∆GOV T ) are additive

and proportional to perturbations in ⌬GCO where ∆∆GCCOa = –kTln(C) and ∆∆GCVO = –kTln(D) . In this

case three parameters, in addition to the equilibrium

parameters in Scheme II, are required to specify the

rate constants:

where ␥00 is the closing rate for the unliganded channel (j ϭ 0) with no voltage sensors activated (i ϭ 0). ⌿V and ⌿Ca represent the fractional perturbations of ⌬GOT produced by voltage sensor activation or Ca2ϩ-binding, respectively (∆∆GOX T = Ψ∆∆GCXO ).
Although Eq. 18 only speciﬁes 25 rate constants, this
is sufﬁcient to characterize the 35 C-O transitions in
Scheme II, provided we make the simplifying assump-
tion that transitions with identical equilibrium con-
stants have identical rate constants. Scheme II predicts
that multiple C-O transitions exist for some combina-
tions of i and j, owing to direct interactions between voltage sensors and Ca2ϩ binding sites represented by

the E-factor in Scheme II. However, these interactions do not alter the C-O equilibrium constants which are identical for any one combination of i and j.
The single barrier model predicts a linear relationship between log closing rate and the number of activated voltage sensors (i) or bound Ca2ϩ (j):

ln (γ ij) = ln (γ 00) – iΨV ln [D] – jΨCa ln [C].

This prediction is inconsistent with the observed relationships between log(␥ij) and i in 0 Ca2ϩ or 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (Fig. 15 B). Thus, a single barrier model is inade-
quate to describe the observed voltage dependence of ␶(IK).

A Two Barrier Model Reproduces the Apparent Ca2ϩ and Voltage Dependence of C-O Transition Kinetics

The relationship between log(␥ij) and voltage sensor activation in 0 Ca2ϩ (Fig. 15 B) suggests that perturba-

tions in ⌬GCO by activation of each voltage sensor produce small ⌬⌬GOT when the ﬁrst three voltage sensors activate, but a larger ⌬⌬GOT for the fourth voltage sen-
sor. This biphasic pattern might arise if the C-O transi-

tion is characterized by two barriers that become rate

limiting over different ranges of ⌬GCO. It seems reasonable that a complex protein conformational change

such as channel opening might be characterized by a

complex energy landscape rather than a single uniform

barrier (Fersht, 1995; Sigg et al., 1999). Thus, we con-

sidered a model in which the C-O transition is repre-

sented by two transition states (T1,T2); Ca2ϩ and voltage are assumed to perturb the energy of the transition

states to different extents as determined by the pertur-

bation

Modeling the C-O transition rates in terms of a com-

plex energy barrier using Eyring rate theory is a sim-

pliﬁcation and requires additional assumptions about

the energy landscape. A two-barrier model suggests

that an energy well deﬁning an intermediate state (SI) might exist between C and O. However, a variety of

macroscopic and single channel kinetics data imply

that the C-O transition is concerted (i.e., highly coop-

erative), such that any intermediate states must have a

low equilibrium occupancy and brief dwell time (see

discussion). Thus, we make the simplifying assump-

tion that the free energy of any intermediate is high

relative to both C and O such that the sum of the rate

constants for leaving SI are fast relative to those for entering. If this general condition is satisﬁed then it is

not necessary to include intermediate states explicitly

in our kinetic scheme. The overall closing rate con-

stant from O to C (␥) is determined by the product of

the rate constant from O to SI and the conditional probability that a channel in S1 will exit to C rather than O. Consequently, the closing rate can be ex-

pressed in terms of the free energy differences between the open state and the two transition states (⌬GOT1, ⌬GOT2):

When the free energies of T1 and T2 are comparable,

rate may be determined by the highest barrier under all

In Fig. 15 C the ␶(IK)-V relationships for all Ca2ϩ were ﬁt simultaneously using the alternative 2-barrier mod-
els described by Eqs. 20 (dashed lines) and 21 (solid
lines). The steady-state parameters were held constant
(Table II, Fit B) while the kinetic parameters were al-
lowed to vary (Table III).
The two-barrier models provide reasonable ﬁts to the 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ data, and reproduce the large
shift in VdN (Fig. 15 D). The models also approximate the ␶(IK)-V relationship in 1 ␮M Ca2ϩ (Fig. 15 D) and capture the envelope of time constants observed over a range of intermediate Ca2ϩ (Fig. 15 C). The model lack-
ing an intermediate state (Eq. 21, Fig. 15, C and D, solid
lines) provided slightly better ﬁts than Eq. 20 (dashed
lines) based on chi-squared criteria. Improved ﬁts at intermediate Ca2ϩ were obtained if KD was reduced (unpublished data). However, a reduction in KD is not consistent with the RO-[Ca2ϩ] relationship. The poorest ﬁts were obtained in 10 ␮M Ca2ϩ, which is not surprising
since the steady-state model underestimates the steepness of the PO-V relationship in 10 Ca2ϩ (Fig. 10 C1).
The closing rate constants predicted by the two barrier
models are plotted in Fig. 15 B (Eq. 20, dashed lines; Eq. 21, solid lines) for different numbers of bound Ca2ϩ (j).
The models not only reproduce the biphasic pattern of closing rates in 0 Ca2ϩ but also the modiﬁcation of this pattern that occurs in saturating Ca2ϩ.

The mechanism by which the two barrier model re-

produces the different patterns of backward rates ob-

served in 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ is illustrated by the

transition state diagrams in Fig. 15 E. In 0 Ca2ϩ at ex-

treme negative voltages the closing rate (␥00) is deter-

mined by the highest barrier (T1). Voltage sensor activation produces little change in ⌬GOT1 ( ΨV1 is small)

such that ␥ij is not greatly altered by activation of one or

two voltage sensors (Fig. 15 E1). However, the energy of

the second barrier (⌬GOT2) is altered by voltage sensor

activation

(

is large) such that T2 becomes rate-limit-

ing, and ␥ becomes sensitive to voltage sensor activa-

tion, when more than three voltage sensors are acti-

vated (starred trace Fig. 15 E1) thereby producing a biphasic pattern in the relationship between ln(␥ij) and i. Ca2ϩ binding also increases ⌬GOT2 ( ΨC2 a is large) such that, in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, T2 becomes rate limiting when
fewer than three voltage sensors are activated (starred

traces Fig. 15 E2). By the same logic, Ca2ϩ exerts little
effect on the closing rate when voltage sensors are not activated ( ΨC1 a is small), but has a much bigger effect
at high voltages when T2 becomes rate limiting. In this way, additive effects of Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor

activation on the C-O equilibrium free energy change

can produce nonlinear changes in ln(␥ij).

DISCUSSION
The combined effects of Ca2ϩ and voltage on BK channel gating are important to understand because they underlie physiological processes in many cell types, but also because they provide information about channel gating that is difﬁcult to obtain from channels that are purely ligand or voltage gated. For example, the voltage dependence of BK channels allows us to compare the gating of liganded and unliganded channels to an extent that is not possible for most ligand-gated channels. BK channels can be activated maximally by voltage in the absence of Ca2ϩ, allowing the detailed study of transitions among unliganded states (Cui et al., 1997; Stefani et al., 1997; Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999; Nimigean and Magleby, 2000; Talukder and Aldrich, 2000). Such openings support allosteric models where ligand-bound and unliganded channels undergo similar conformational changes, but

ligand binding alters the energetics of certain transitions. Here we compare the gating of Ca2ϩ-bound and unliganded BK channels to identify Ca2ϩ-sensitive transitions and determine the mechanism of Ca2ϩ action.
Relationship to Previous Studies
Previous studies support the basic conclusion that both voltage sensor activation and Ca2ϩ binding act to promote BK channel opening through allosteric mechanisms (Cox et al., 1997a; Cui et al., 1997; Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999; Rothberg and Magleby, 1999, 2000; Cox and Aldrich, 2000; Cui and Aldrich, 2000; Talukder and Aldrich, 2000; Zhang et al., 2001). However, as discussed below, none of these studies have fully tested the assumptions and predictions of a particular mechanism such as Scheme II.
In general, BK channels distribute among a large number of states in a Ca2ϩ- and voltage-dependent manner. Scheme II predicts a gating architecture (i.e., connectivity among states) and equilibrium constants that are determined by the model parameters and by assumptions about the functional properties of sensors and gates and their interactions with each other. Thus, in theory, the gating mechanism can be tested by determining the arrangement of states and the relationships among the equilibria.
Single channel IK kinetic analysis conﬁrms that BK channels can occupy many different open and closed states consistent with the allosteric assumption that no combination of sensor and gate conformations are disallowed (Rothberg and Magleby, 1999; Talukder and Aldrich, 2000). Moreover, these kinetics can be reproduced by gating schemes with separate voltageand Ca2ϩ-dependent transitions (Rothberg and Magleby, 2000) consistent with a mechanism where Ca2ϩand voltage sensors are capable of nonconcerted action. However, the number of accessible states is large, transitions associated with voltage and Ca2ϩ sensor activation are fast, and single channel recordings at extreme voltages are difﬁcult. Hence, some states are rarely occupied or are difﬁcult to resolve so that many rate constants, and the corresponding equilibrium constants, are poorly determined. Restricting the analysis to the unliganded or Ca2ϩ-saturated conditions reduces the number of accessible states and improves, but does not solve, the problem of determining the relationship among equilibrium constants (Rothberg and Magleby, 1999; Talukder and Aldrich, 2000).
The Ca2ϩ and voltage dependence of BK channel open probability also provide information about the underlying gating mechanism. Models similar to Scheme II have been used to ﬁt the shape and Ca2ϩ dependence of macroscopic G-V relationships successfully over a wide range of conditions (Cox and Aldrich,

2000; Cui and Aldrich, 2000; Zhang et al., 2001). However, some parameters in Scheme II are poorly constrained by such data and others covary, and thus are not determined uniquely (Zhang et al., 2001). As we have shown in Fig. 10 A, excellent ﬁts can be obtained when some parameters are adjusted to unrealistic values. Thus, our ability to test many aspects of the mechanism by the G-V data alone is questionable.
Additional tests of the BK channel gating mechanism are provided by combining IK data with manipulations of channel function. The effect on G-V relationships of the accessory ␤1 subunit (Cox and Aldrich, 2000) or mutations in the S4 voltage sensor (Cui and Aldrich, 2000) are consistent with mechanisms similar to Scheme II. In addition the effects of voltage sensor, mutations suggest that the interaction between Ca2ϩ binding sites and voltage sensors are weak. However, the extent to which this conclusion is model dependent or can be quantiﬁed is unclear.
Testing the Allosteric Gating Mechanism
To test the mechanism of BK channel gating we have measured gating currents, extended IK measurements to extreme negative voltages, and employed conditions in which subsets of the processes and interactions depicted in Scheme II can be studied in isolation. Gating currents allow us to characterize voltage sensor function directly and to examine the interaction of voltage sensors with Ca2ϩ binding and channel opening. The limiting voltage dependence of PO provides additional information about the interaction between voltage sensor activation and channel opening that is not obtained readily from gating currents. Measurements of PO and macroscopic IK relaxation kinetics at extreme negative voltages provide direct information about the C-O transition properties and allow us to test the interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and channel opening in a way that is independent of voltage sensor activation. Although we do not monitor the Ca2ϩ-bound state of the channel directly, the Ca2ϩ dependence of PO at extreme negative voltages provides a more direct indication of Ca2ϩ binding properties than previous measurements based on Ca2ϩ dependence of the half activation voltage. By focusing on conditions of high (70–100 ␮M) and low (1 nM) [Ca2ϩ] we are able to examine gating when the state of the Ca2ϩ binding site is well deﬁned (i.e., saturated or unliganded).
Another important strategy used in this investigation was to examine the reciprocal nature of interactions between sensors and gates. Such reciprocal interactions are a hallmark of allosteric mechanisms and provide alternative methods to measure each interaction factor in Scheme II.
Our results allow us to make a number of conclusions about the properties and relationships between voltage sensor activation, calcium binding, subunit interac-

298 Coupling of Voltage Sensor, Ca2ϩ Binding, and Channel Opening

tions, and channel opening that are outlined in the following sections.
Isolation of Channel Opening, Voltage Sensor Activation, and Ca2ϩ Binding
A basic prediction of an allosteric gating mechanism is that all combinations of sensor and gate conformation are allowed. We have tested this hypothesis by examining mSlo1 gating under a variety of extreme conditions. Channel opening is weakly voltage dependent at extreme negative voltages in the absence of Ca2ϩ. This shows that the C-O conformational change occurs whether or not voltage sensors or Ca2ϩ-binding sites are activated. Similarly, gating currents are observed when channels are closed or open in the presence or absence of Ca2ϩ. Thus, voltage sensors can activate whether channels are closed or open, unliganded or Ca2ϩ bound. That Ca2ϩ sensors activate whether or not voltage sensors are activated is indicated by the ability of Ca2ϩ to increase PO at extreme positive and negative voltages. Similarly, the ability of Ca2ϩ to shift the open and closed channel charge distributions (QO, QC) and to alter ␶(IK) at both extreme positive and negative voltages indicates that Ca2ϩ binds whether channels are open or closed.
The Functional Properties of Sensor Activation and Channel Opening
Scheme II assumes that voltage sensor activation, Ca2ϩ binding, and channel opening can each be described by simple two-state processes and that voltage and Ca2ϩ sensors in different subunits act independently. These assumptions appear reasonable within the resolution of our measurements, although indirect evidence suggests that channel opening may not be completely concerted and that voltage sensors in different subunits may interact weakly.
The R-A Transition
Consistent with a two-state model of voltage sensor activation, gating currents recorded in the absence of Ca2ϩ activate without a detectable delay and decay with a rapid exponential time course while channels are closed (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999). In the presence of 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, a slow component of IgON decay is evident, and slow components of both ON and OFF charge movement are observed. However, these observations are readily accounted for by interactions between channel opening and voltage sensor movement and do not imply a complex voltage sensor activation mechanism. Qfast-V relationships determined by ﬁtting the fast component of IgON in either 0 or 70 Ca2ϩ reﬂect the voltage sensor equilibrium for closed channels (QC) and are ﬁt well by single Boltzmann functions, again consistent with a two-state process and a voltage

sensor charge zJ ϭ 0.58 e. The limiting slope of the PO-V relationship that reveals the voltage sensor equilibrium for open channels (QO) is also ﬁt reasonably by a single Boltzmann function. Although exponential kinetics and a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution are consistent with the assumption of independent voltage sensor movement, the increased slope of the QO-V relationship caused by Ca2ϩ is not predicted by Scheme II. This effect may indicate a small cooperative interaction among voltage sensors or may represent a systematic measurement error related to large Ca2ϩ-dependent increases in PO.
The C-O Transition
Scheme II represents the C-O conformational change as a concerted two-state process that is rate limiting for channel activation and has a weak intrinsic voltage dependence. Consistent with a two-state C-O transition, macroscopic IK relaxation kinetics are single exponential after a brief delay, over a wide range of voltage and [Ca2ϩ] (Cox et al., 1997a; Cui et al., 1997; Horrigan et al., 1999). The delay can be attributed to voltage sensor activation (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999) and does not imply a complex C-O transition. The exponential voltage dependence of ␶(IK) over a large range of negative voltages is also consistent with a two-state process. The weak voltage dependence of ␶(IK) and PO at negative voltages demonstrates that charge movement associated with the C-O transition is small (zL ϭ 0.3 e).
Single channel studies also support a two-state C-O conformational change. The number of detectable open and closed dwell-time components are comparable under a variety of conditions (McManus and Magleby, 1988; Rothberg and Magleby, 1999; Nimigean and Magleby, 2000; Talukder and Aldrich, 2000). This observation is consistent with an allosteric mechanism like Scheme II with a concerted C-O transition that implies gating schemes with an equal number of open and closed states directly connected in a two-tiered arrangement. Kinetic components can underestimate the accessible states and do not generally provide a precise comparison of closed versus open states. However, in 0 Ca2ϩ (Nimigean and Magleby, 2000; Talukder and Aldrich, 2000) and saturating (100–1,000 ␮M) Ca2ϩ (Rothberg and Magleby, 1999), where the accessible states are minimized, the number of open and closed components are less than or equal to the number of states predicted by Scheme II (ﬁve open, ﬁve closed), consistent with a concerted C-O transition. In addition, two-dimensional dwell time distributions are consistent with the connectivity of open and closed states speciﬁed by a two-tiered gating architecture (Rothberg and Magleby, 1999). And the detailed kinetics can be reproduced by models similar to Scheme II (Rothberg and Magleby, 1999, 2000).

299 Horrigan and Aldrich

Although the macroscopic and single channel kinetics are generally consistent with a two state C-O transition, the C-O transition maybe more complex. Brief “ﬂicker” closings are commonly observed in single BK channel recordings. These events are not predicted by Scheme II and may represent intermediates during the C-O conformational change or closed states, such as blocking events, that lie outside of the activation pathway. Detailed single channel analysis cannot distinguish these possibilities (Rothberg and Magleby, 1998). In addition, as discussed below, the voltage and Ca2ϩ dependence of macroscopic ␶(IK) suggest that C-O transition kinetics respond in a complex fashion to voltage sensor activation and Ca2ϩ binding. To account for these results we have suggested that the C-O conformational change may be characterized by a complex energy landscape.
Ca2ϩ Binding
It is reasonable to describe Ca2ϩ binding to each high afﬁnity binding site as a two-state process. However, we do not measure Ca2ϩ binding directly, and the indirect analysis of Ca2ϩ-binding properties based on the Ca2ϩ dependence of channel opening is complicated by the presence in Slo1 channels of additional low afﬁnity binding sites and by effects of Ca2ϩ on voltage sensor activation. Here we have measured open probability at extreme negative voltages to isolate the effect of Ca2ϩ binding on channel opening from its effect on voltage sensor activation. Under these conditions, the ratio (RO) of NPO in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ should depend only on the Ca2ϩ dissociation constant (KD) and the allosteric interaction between Ca2ϩ-binding and channel opening (C). The Ca2ϩ dependence of RO is well ﬁt by an MWC model (sub-Scheme IIc), consistent with independent and identical two-state binding reactions. The KDs determined in this fashion (9.3 Ϯ 0.4 ␮M) or used in Scheme II (11 ␮M) fall within the range of previous estimates for mSlo1 (7.4– 11.2 ␮M) (Cox et al., 1997a; Cox and Aldrich, 2000; Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001).
It is important to realize that Scheme II speciﬁes four different state-dependent Ca2ϩ dissociation constants for the high-afﬁnity binding site. KD represents the dissociation constant for closed channels when voltage sensors are in the resting state (KD[CR] ϭ 11 ␮M). Channel opening produces a C-fold (eightfold) increase in afﬁnity (KD[OR] ϭ 1.4 ␮M). Voltage sensor activation produces an additional E-fold (2.4-fold) increase in afﬁnity for both closed and open channels (KD[CA] ϭ 4.6 ␮M, KD[OA] ϭ 0.57 ␮M).
The extent to which Ca2ϩ binding may be voltage dependent has yet to be deﬁned. The gating of unliganded channels rules out that voltage gating is determined solely by Ca2ϩ binding (Cui et al., 1997). However, voltage-dependent binding could potentially

contribute to voltage gating and provide clues as to the location of the Ca2ϩ binding site relative to the membrane electric ﬁeld. PO or ␶(IK) exhibit similar voltage dependencies in different [Ca2ϩ], suggesting that Ca2ϩ binding is not strongly voltage dependent relative to voltage sensor activation (Cox et al., 1997a; Rothberg and Magleby, 2000). Assuming Ca2ϩ binding is not rate limiting for channel gating (Cox et al., 1997a; Cui et al., 1997), effects of voltage on Ca2ϩ binding should be evident only at intermediate [Ca2ϩ] where the occupancy of binding sites can be altered by changes in binding afﬁnity. Since PO increases with Ca2ϩ occupancy, one consequence of voltage-dependent binding should be to increase the voltage dependence of PO at intermediate [Ca2ϩ] relative to saturated or unliganded conditions. Although a bell-shaped dependence on [Ca2ϩ] is observed in the steepness of PO-V relationships (Cui et al., 1997), this effect can be reproduced by a model similar to Scheme II without voltage-dependent Ca2ϩ binding (Cox and Aldrich, 2000). Our results indicate an apparent increase with [Ca2ϩ] in the voltage dependence of PO at extreme negative voltages (q0, Fig. 12 C). But this effect is not characterized by a bell-shaped Ca2ϩ dependence and may reﬂect measurement error at low open probability. ␶(IK), which can be measured with greater precision than PO at extreme voltages, exhibits exponential voltage dependencies at both positive and negative voltages that are essentially Ca2ϩ independent (Fig. 14 C). From these kinetic results we conclude that the voltage dependence of Ca2ϩ binding must be weak relative to that of the C-O transition (zL ϭ 0.3 e). Therefore, we make the simplifying assumption in Scheme II that Ca2ϩ binding is voltage independent.
Interactions Among Sensors and Gates
We pursued several distinct goals in characterizing the interactions among voltage sensor activation, Ca2ϩ-binding, and channel opening. First was to quantify the interaction energies, i.e., the allosteric factors C, D, E in Scheme II. When possible, we determined these quantities by measuring the equilibrium (energetic) change in a target process produced by extreme (saturating) changes in the state of a coupled effector process. Second, we tested the allosteric prediction that such interactions are reciprocal in nature. Finally, to test the Scheme II prediction that the activation of an individual sensor has an additive effect on the C-O equilibrium constant, we ﬁt the Ca2ϩ and voltage dependencies of PO.
Interaction of Ca2ϩ Binding and Channel Opening
Interactions between Ca2ϩ binding and channel opening can in theory be studied in isolation from voltage sensor activation at extreme positive or negative voltages. However, at extreme positive voltages where all voltage sensors are activated, measurement of IK is difﬁ-

300 Coupling of Voltage Sensor, Ca2ϩ Binding, and Channel Opening

cult and PO saturates, even in the absence of Ca2ϩ, providing little information about the C-O equilibrium constant. The effect of Ca2ϩ on channel opening is best
studied at extreme negative voltages where no voltage
sensors are activated and PO is small. Under these conditions, PO increases in a Ca2ϩ-dependent manner by more than three orders of magnitude, indicating a strong interaction between Ca2ϩ binding and channel
opening. To quantify this interaction, we determined
the ratio (RO) of NPO in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ. According to Scheme II, RO ϭ C4 in saturating Ca2ϩ, providing a direct measure of the interaction factor C ϭ 7.4 Ϯ 0.1 (1.20 kcal molϪ1) based on mean RO. This is lower than values of C reported previously for mSlo1 (C ϭ 8.4–11.6) (Cox et al., 1997a; Cox and Al-
drich, 2000; Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001). How-
ever, the previous estimates, based on PO at more positive voltages, reﬂect interactions between Ca2ϩ binding
and voltage sensor activation and therefore represent a
composite of the allosteric factors C and E in Scheme II.
Once C was determined from the saturating value of RO, the RO-Ca2ϩ relationship was ﬁt well by an MWC model (sub-Scheme IIC) by simply adjusting KD. The ability of sub-Scheme IIC to ﬁt the Ca2ϩ dependence of RO supports the assumption that Ca2ϩ sensors in different subunits have independent and identical additive
effects on the free energy of the C-O transition. The reciprocal effect of channel opening on Ca2ϩ-
binding predicted by the allosteric model was not tested directly by measuring bound Ca2ϩ. However ␶(IK) measured at extreme positive voltage (␶P) or negative voltages (␶N) should reﬂect the distribution of Ca2ϩ-bound closed and open states respectively. That ␶N is sensitive to sub-micromolar Ca2ϩ while ␶P is not is therefore qualitatively consistent with the prediction that an increase in Ca2ϩ-afﬁnity accompanies channel opening.

Interaction of Voltage Sensor Activation and Channel Opening

Interactions between voltage sensor and gate can be studied in isolation from Ca2ϩ binding in the unliganded or Ca2ϩ-saturated states. The PO-V relationships under these conditions reﬂect the effect of voltage sen-
sor activation on channel opening. Speciﬁcally, the
change in PO that occurs from extreme negative voltages (VN Ͻ Ϫ100 mV), where no voltage sensors are activated, to extreme positive voltages (VP Ͼ 250 mV), where all voltage sensors are activated, reﬂects the in-
teraction energy and the intrinsic voltage dependence
of the C-O transition. Scheme II predicts:

λ-λ---AA---04--[-[--VV----NP---]]- = D4ezL(VP – VN) ⁄ kT,

(22)

where (␭A␫) is the C-O equilibrium constant when i voltage sensors are activated and zL is its partial charge.

301 Horrigan and Aldrich

␭A0[VN] is well determined in both 0 Ca2ϩ and high (70–100 ␮M) Ca2ϩ by measurements of PO over a range
of negative voltages, whereas zL can be estimated from
the weak voltage dependence of Po[VN]. Unfortunately ␭ ϭ PO/(1 Ϫ PO) cannot be measured accurately at ex-
treme positive voltages because PO(VP) saturates, near unity, even in 0 Ca2ϩ. Therefore, D cannot be deter-

mined from Eq. 22. However, we can place a lower limit on D by considering that ␭ Յ ␭A4 for any V Յ VP. Thus:

(23)

In 0 Ca2ϩ, the mean half-activation voltage Vh(PO) is 186 mV and ␭A0[VN] ϭ PO(Ϫ124 mV) ϭ 3.2 ϫ 10Ϫ7. Therefore, Eq. 23 yields D Ն 17 (⌬⌬G ϭ 1.7 kcal molϪ1) if zL ϭ 0.3 e.
A best value of D ϭ 25 (⌬⌬G ϭ 1.93 kcal molϪ1) was
ultimately determined by ﬁtting PO over the entire voltage range. The ability of Scheme II to ﬁt the PO-V relationships supports the assumption that activation of
each individual voltage sensor has an additive effect on

channel opening. Several lines of evidence conﬁrm the allosteric pre-

diction that channel opening has a reciprocal effect on

voltage sensor activation. First, the decay of OFF gating current is slowed when channels are opened (Fig. 13).

In addition IgON increases in amplitude in response to a double pulse protocol (Fig. 11). Finally, the open chan-

nel charge distribution (QO) estimated from the limiting voltage dependence of PO (Fig. 12 A) is shifted to more negative voltages than the closed channel distri-

bution (QC) determined from IgON (Fig. 7 C). The similar shapes of QO and QC are consistent with the prediction that channel opening has equivalent effects on all

four voltage sensors.
The shift in half-activation voltage between QC and QO (⌬Vh[QCO]) provides an additional measure of the interaction factor D = exp (zj∆VH[QCO] ⁄ kT) . In 0 Ca2ϩ, the half-activation voltages for QC (155 mV) and QO (Ϫ4.3 mV) differ by 159 mV, yielding D ϭ 38.5 (⌬⌬G ϭ 2.19 kcal molϪ1) if zJ ϭ 0.58 e. Although this
estimate of D is 54% greater than that obtained by ﬁt-
ting the PO-V relationships (D ϭ 25), the difference in energetic terms (⌬⌬G ϭ ln[D]) is only 13% and

could be accounted for by a 19 mV overestimation of ⌬Vh(QCO). Several factors might contribute to an error of this magnitude, including patch-to-patch variation,

the different ionic conditions used to measure QO and
QC, and that QO is extrapolated from a ﬁt to the foot of the ϽqaϾ-V relationship.

Interaction of Ca2ϩ Binding and Voltage Sensor Activation

We isolated the effect of Ca2ϩ binding on voltage sensor activation from its effect on channel opening by taking advantage of the fact that C-O transition kinetics

are much slower than voltage sensor activation in Slo1
channels. Fast components of gating charge movement occurring in the ﬁrst 100–200 ␮s after a voltage step re-
veal the kinetic and steady-state properties of voltage
sensor activation while the open/closed state of the
channel remains effectively constant (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999). For closed channels, we ﬁnd 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ
slows the fast component of IgOFF but has little or no effect on IgON. Consistent with a slowing of voltage sensor deactivation, the QC-V relationship shifts by Ϫ33 mV in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, as determined by gating-capacitance mea-
surements. Similarly, the QO-V relationship shifts by Ϫ43 mV. According to Scheme II, the shifts in QC and QO are produced by an E-fold increase in the equilibrium constant for voltage sensor activation where E = exp (zj∆VH[Q] ⁄ kT) ranges from 2.1 to 2.7 (⌬⌬G ϭ 0.45 to 0.59 kcal molϪ1) based on QC and QO, respectively. The shift in QC may underestimate E because Ca2ϩ binding sites in the closed channel, with a KD of 11 ␮M, are expected to be 86% occupied in 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ, whereas open channels with a higher Ca2ϩ afﬁnity should be fully saturated. A ﬁnal value of E ϭ 2.4 was
assigned to Scheme II based on ﬁts to the PO-V relationships over a range of [Ca2ϩ].
In Scheme II we assume that the effects of Ca2ϩ on
voltage sensor activation and channel opening are mediated by the same Ca2ϩ binding sites. An alternative hypothesis is that Ca2ϩ can bind nonspeciﬁcally to the
channel or membrane and shift the voltage depen-
dence of voltage sensor activation through a charge
screening mechanism. We cannot rule out this possibil-
ity based on gating current measurements because the dose-dependent effects of Ca2ϩ were not examined. However, IK measurements over a range of Ca2ϩ support the assumption that effects of Ca2ϩ on voltage sen-
sor activation are mediated by high afﬁnity binding
sites. First, the QO-V relationship shifts even in low micromolar Ca2ϩ (Fig. 12 B), whereas surface charge ef-
fects are unlikely at such low concentrations. In addi-
tion, we have described a difference between the apparent Ca2ϩ sensitivities of Vh(PO) and PO measured at extreme negative voltages (i.e., RO), which can be accounted for by interactions between Ca2ϩ binding and
voltage sensor activation. The discrepancy between Vh(PO) and Ro is evident even in submicromolar Ca2ϩ and is well described by Scheme II (Fig. 9 D) from 0 to 100 ␮M Ca2ϩ, consistent with the assumption that effects of Ca2ϩ on voltage sensor activation and channel
opening are mediated by the same binding sites.
Limitations of Limiting Slope Measurements
The maximal voltage dependence of PO (i.e., peak ϽqaϾ) does not provide a direct indication of total gating
charge for channels like Slo1 that can occupy multiple
open states (Sigg and Bezanilla, 1997; Horrigan et al.,

1999). We have shown that peak ϽqaϾ underestimates the total gating charge of mSlo1 by 26–44% in a Ca2ϩ-dependent manner (Fig. 12 E). The tendency of peak ϽqaϾ to decrease with increasing [Ca2ϩ] is reproduced by Scheme II without requiring that Ca2ϩ binding is voltage dependent or that Ca2ϩ ions contribute to gating charge. These observations have consequences for the interpretation of previous studies. For example, Diaz et al. (1998) studied the effect of charge altering point mutations in the S4 voltage sensor of hSlo1. The voltage dependence of PO at low voltages was used to assess changes in total gating charge. Their conclusions concerning the contribution of different S4 residues to gating charge are difﬁcult to evaluate given the tendency of this method to underestimate gating charge and because different mutants were studied in different [Ca2ϩ].
Mechanism of Channel Activation by Low Afﬁnity Ca2ϩ Binding Sites
Recent studies indicate that Ca2ϩ and Mg2ϩ at high concentrations (Ͼ100 ␮M) can act at low afﬁnity (millimolar) binding sites to promote channel opening (Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001). These studies conclude that Ca2ϩ binding at low afﬁnity sites increases the C-O equilibrium constant through an allosteric mechanism analogous to that embodied by the allosteric factor C in Scheme II. An alternative hypothesis, that low afﬁnity sites interact exclusively with voltage sensors, was rejected (Zhang et al., 2001). However, the possibility that low afﬁnity sites interact with both C-O and R-A transition as in Scheme II was not ruled out. Indeed, our results and analysis suggest that low afﬁnity sites must interact with voltage sensors.
When Ca2ϩ is increased from 100 to 1,000 ␮M we observe an approximately Ϫ30 mV shift in Vh(PO). This effect is consistent with previous reports (Cox et al., 1997a; Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001) and can be reproduced (Fig. 9 D, dotted line) by modifying Scheme II after Zhang et al. (2001) to include additional low afﬁnity binding sites (KDLow ϭ 2.33 mM) that are allosterically coupled to the C-O transition (CLow ϭ 3.53). If Ca2ϩ binding at these sites acts merely to increase the C-O equilibrium constant, then changes in Vh(PO) should be accompanied by proportional changes in PO at extreme negative voltages. Consequently the modiﬁed model predicts a 27% increase in log(RO) from 100 to 1,000 ␮M Ca2ϩ (Fig. 9 D, dashed line) corresponding to a large ninefold increase in PO. By contrast, we observe a 2.4% increase in mean log(RO), similar to the 3.6% increase predicted by Scheme II, and a maximum 9% increase was observed in an individual experiment (Fig. 8 E). Thus, the RO data are inconsistent with the hypothesis that Ca2ϩ binding to low afﬁnity sites acts merely to increase the C-O equilibrium constant.

302 Coupling of Voltage Sensor, Ca2ϩ Binding, and Channel Opening

A discrepancy between the Ca2ϩ dependence of Vh(PO) and RO is observed in 0–100 ␮M Ca2ϩ and can be accounted for by interactions between high afﬁnity Ca2ϩ binding sites and voltage sensors. As shown in Fig. 9 D, Scheme II predicts Vh(PO) will begin to increase over a range of Ca2ϩ where RO remains relatively constant. A similar mechanism involving interaction of low afﬁnity sites with voltage sensors might account for the differential response of Vh(PO) and RO to Ca2ϩ in the 100–1,000 ␮M range. If this is the case, measurements at [Ca2ϩ] Ͼ 1 mM may be necessary to reveal an effect of low afﬁnity sites on RO.
If Ca2ϩ binding at low afﬁnity sites increases the voltage sensor equilibrium, then the charge distribution for open channels (QO) should shift to more negative voltages in high Ca2ϩ. Although we did not test this prediction, kinetic data reported by Zhang et. al. (2001) are consistent with a shift in QO. According to our analysis, ␶(IK) achieves a weak exponential voltage dependence at extreme negative voltages and can deviate from this limiting voltage dependence only when QO begins to increase. Consistent with this prediction, ␶(IK)-V in 0–100 ␮M Ca2ϩ exhibit a similar limiting voltage dependence between Ϫ300 and Ϫ150 mV (Fig. 14, B and C) where QO has apparently achieved a minimum (Fig. 12 B). Similar behavior is observed in the ␶(IK)-V data reported by Zhang et al. (2001) for 0–100 ␮M Ca2ϩ with a limiting voltage dependence of e-fold per 195 mV (zN ϭ Ϫ0.13 e) from Ϫ200 to Ϫ150 mV in 1 ␮M Ca2ϩ (measured from Fig. 10 A [Zhang et al., 2001]). By contrast, ␶(IK)-V in 10–100 mM Ca2ϩ is approximately fourfold steeper (zN ϭ Ϫ0.51 e, 10 mM Ca2ϩ) over the same voltage range. This result suggests that the foot of the QO-V relationship has shifted to voltages more negative than Ϫ200 mV in 10 mM Ca2ϩ. Thus, low afﬁnity Ca2ϩ binding sites may interact with voltage sensor activation.
Kinetic Models and the Nature of the C-O Transition
Although we depict the C-O transition in Scheme II as a two-state reaction, it is likely to represent a complex quaternary conformational change involving the concerted movement of four subunits. The existence of concerted but asynchronous transitions are well recognized in the case of protein-folding reactions where multiple interactions may be broken and formed during a rapid transition between two stable conformations (Fersht, 1995). In such a case, the transition-free energy cannot be described as a smooth symmetrical barrier as might characterize a simple small molecule reaction. Rather, complex energy landscapes are observed where the barrier is often described as “broad” and may also be “rugged,” containing numerous local maxima and minima (Fersht, 1995; Oliveberg et al.,

1998). A complex barrier is not incompatible with apparent two-state behavior provided that the intermediate species are unstable and do not accumulate. Moreover, a complex transition with a single dominant barrier can exhibit simple kinetic behaviors, such as linear free energy relationships, in response to small equilibrium perturbations. However, large perturbations frequently alter the position or identity of the rate limiting barrier, producing complex changes in the relationship between equilibria and kinetics (Oliveberg et al., 1998; Oliveberg, 2001). In some cases, nonlinear free energy relationships are observed that have been interpreted in terms of a gradual shift in the position of the transition state along the reaction coordinate, the so called Hammond postulate behavior (Matouschek and Fersht, 1993; Hammond, 1955; Matouschek et al., 1995; Matthews and Fersht, 1995). In other cases, sudden or large changes in the slope of linear free energy relationships are observed that are thought to represent a switch in the rate-determining barrier similar to that proposed here for the C-O transition of mSlo1 (Milla et al., 1995; Jonsson et al., 1996; Silow and Oliveberg, 1997; Oliveberg et al., 1998).
The voltage and Ca2ϩ dependence of ␶(IK) for mSlo1 suggest that C-O transition kinetics respond in a complex fashion to voltage sensor activation and Ca2ϩ binding. In particular, biphasic relationships are observed between closing rate constants and voltage sensor activation in 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ. To account for this feature of the data we propose a two-barrier transition state model for the C-O conformational change. The model reproduces the biphasic pattern of closing rates as well as the changes that occur in that pattern between 0 Ca2ϩ and 70 ␮M Ca2ϩ (Fig. 15 B). The ␶(IK)-V relationships at intermediate Ca2ϩ are only approximated by this scheme and it is possible that a more complex model is required. However, this example illustrates the basic point that complex patterns of rate constants can be reproduced while maintaining the Scheme II assumptions that the C-O transition is concerted and that activation of individual voltage sensors and Ca2ϩ binding sites have additive effects on the C-O transition energy.
It is conceivable that the effects of Ca2ϩ binding and voltage sensor activation on the C-O transition energy are to some extent nonadditive (i.e., cooperative), and this might account for the tendency of Scheme II to overestimate the steepness of PO-V relationships in intermediate [Ca2ϩ]. Since the rate constants in Fig. 15 B were determined from ﬁts to Scheme II, the pattern of closing rates could also be affected by the assumption of energy additivity. Regardless of this possibility, the behavior of ␶(IK) at negative voltages supports the general conclusion that Ca2ϩ binding alters the sensitivity of C-O rate constants to voltage sensor activation. ␶(IK)

should only deviate from a limiting exponential voltage dependence at extreme negative voltages when voltage sensors begin to activate and the O-to-C rate constant decreases. The voltage at which this deviation occurs is strongly affected by Ca2ϩ, whereas voltage sensor activation (QO) is not. This implies that fewer voltage sensors need be activated in high Ca2ϩ to produce a decrease in the closing rate constant.
Our two-barrier model predicts a linear relationship between log closing rate and the free energy perturbation produced by activation of a few Ca2ϩ or voltage sensors, but deviation from a linear relationship as more sensors are activated. This hypothesis appears reasonable given the intrinsic voltage dependence of the C-O transition and the magnitude of the perturbations produced by voltage sensor activation and Ca2ϩ binding. At negative voltages in 0 Ca2ϩ, where voltage and Ca2ϩ sensors are not activated, ␶(IK) exhibits an exponential dependence on voltage over an ‫ف‬400 mV voltage range (Ϫ500 to –100 mV) (Horrigan et al., 1999). We expect 1/␶(IK), at extreme negative voltages, to represent the closing rate constant, and the C-O equilibrium–free energy should change in proportion to voltage. Thus, the exponential voltage dependence of ␶(IK) shows that the C-O transition exhibits a rate-equilibrium linear free energy relationship over an ‫ف‬120-fold change in the C-O equilibrium constant (assuming zL ϭ 0.3 e). Linear free energy relationships were also reported for acetylcholine receptor channels in response to a three order of magnitude change in the C-O equilibrium constant (Grosman et al., 2000). We observe similar behavior in mSlo1 in response to 2–3 order of magnitude perturbations in the C-O equilibrium constant by activation of two voltage sensors (D2 ϭ 625) or even Ca2ϩ-binding to all four high afﬁnity sites (C4 ϭ 4.1 ϫ 103). However, we observe deviations from linearity when additional sensors are activated, since a large nine order of magnitude maximum perturbation is possible (C4D4 ϭ 1.6 ϫ 109, 12.7 kcal moleϪ1).
There is evidence in BK and other channels for activation-associated transiently occupied sub-conductance states that may support the notion of a complex C-O transition. Although stable subconductance events in BK channels are rare, brief (‫ف‬50 ␮s) sojourns to a subconductance level (10–35% of fully open) are frequently observed during “ﬂicker” closings or immediately before and after transitions to a fully closed state (Ferguson et al., 1993). Similarly, Shaker Kϩ channels pass through two sequentially occupied substates with microsecond lifetimes during the transition between fully closed and open (Zheng et al., 2001). These brief subconductance events could represent metastable intermediates in what is an essentially concerted but complex C-O transition.
