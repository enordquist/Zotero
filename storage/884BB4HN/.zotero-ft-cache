ABSTRACT: The Hsp70 family of chaperones plays an essential role in suppressing protein aggregation in the cell. Here we investigate the factors controlling the intrinsic ability of human Hsp70 to inhibit the elongation of amyloid ﬁbrils formed by the Parkinson’s disease-related protein α-synuclein. Using kinetic analysis, we show that Hsp70 binds preferentially to α-synuclein ﬁbrils as a consequence of variations in the association and dissociation rate constants of binding to the diﬀerent aggregated states of the protein. Our ﬁndings illustrate the importance of the kinetics of binding of molecular chaperones, and also of potential therapeutic molecules, in the eﬃcient suppression of speciﬁc pathogenic events linked to neurodegeneration.
T he 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family provides a major line of defense against protein misfolding and aggregation,1−3 and its activity has been linked to protection against amyloid disease.4 In particular, Hsp70 has been found to inhibit strongly the in vitro aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn),1,2,5 a 140-residue intrinsically disordered protein whose deposition in the brain is associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD),6,7 and studies in vivo show that Hsp70 plays a fundamental protective role against αSyn-induced pathologies.4,8,9 Recently, it has been shown that Hsp70 is also able to disaggregate amyloid ﬁbrils when acting in a concerted manner with a complex cochaperone network.10,11 Interestingly, Hsp70 is still able to suppress eﬀectively ﬁbril formation in the absence of cochaperones via its intrinsic antiaggregation activity.1,2
As Hsp70 has been shown to be able to inhibit amyloid formation in vitro at substoichiometric concentrations relative to the aggregating protein,1,2,12,13 it has been suggested that Hsp70 possesses an intrinsically higher binding aﬃnity for aggregated relative to monomeric amyloidogenic proteins.1,2,13 In the case of αSyn, it has been shown that Hsp70 (even in the absence of cochaperones) is able to bind to many αSyn species,11 with preferential binding to the monomeric,12 preﬁbrillar,1,13 or ﬁbrillar13 forms of the protein, all being

proposed as the key step in the process of Hsp70 inhibition of αSyn ﬁbril formation.
In order to shed light on the mechanism of the intrinsic antiaggregation activity of Hsp70 (isoform 1A) and the speciﬁc inhibitory contributions of the interactions between Hsp70 and various αSyn aggregated species, we investigated the eﬀect of Hsp70 at physiological pH on the aggregation of αSyn (Figure 1) in the absence and presence of ATP and 5% preformed αSyn ﬁbrils (also called “seeds”; Figure S1). Hsp70 showed a strong inhibition in both conditions, where either multiple nucleation and elongation events, or only elongation processes, respectively, govern the system.14 We then studied αSyn ﬁbril elongation to investigate the eﬀect of the chaperone on this key microscopic step of amyloid proliferation.
To inhibit ﬁbril elongation, Hsp70 must interact with either the monomeric or ﬁbrillar forms of αSyn, or both. In agreement with previous reports,1,2 we found that Hsp70 binds to both forms of the protein (Figure 1c,d). We determined the apparent dissociation constant of Hsp70 to monomeric αSyn, Kd,M, to be 24 ± 3 μM in the nucleotide-free form and 1.8 ± 0.2 μM in the ATP-bound form of the chaperone (Figure 1c), in agreement with earlier studies.2
Given that Hsp70 is able to bind αSyn in both its monomeric and ﬁbrillar forms, we set out to identify the speciﬁc contributions of these interactions to the overall mechanism of inhibition by carrying out a detailed kinetic analysis.15,16 We found a progressive decrease in the initial ﬁbril elongation rate with increasing concentrations of Hsp70, with signiﬁcant eﬀects even at a 1:10 molar ratio of chaperone to monomeric αSyn (Figure 2b). We then set out to analyze globally the initial kinetic proﬁles obtained by using a series of diﬀerent mechanistic models.
In the light of our results, we considered a model in which Hsp70 binds to both αSyn monomers and ﬁbril ends (Figure 2a, kinetic equations reported in the Supplementary Methods) and performed a global analysis of the series of aggregation proﬁles measured at diﬀerent Hsp70 concentrations, which has

concentrations of seeds in the absence of Hsp70 (Figure S3),

and was assumed to be independent of the concentration of

Hsp70. The equilibrium dissociation constant for monomeric

αSyn was also ﬁxed as a known parameter (Kd,M = koff,M/kon,M = 1.8 μM, determined in the presence of ATP by ﬂuorescence

titration experiments, Figure 1c). The association and

dissociation rate constants kon,F and koff,F were evaluated for the diﬀerent mechanistic scenarios.

In a ﬁrst set of calculations, the binding of Hsp70 to αSyn

ﬁbrils was neglected, and we attempted to describe the

experimental data by considering only interactions with αSyn

monomers; the results (Figure 2b, left) show that this model is

incompatible with the experimental data, since only a very small

decrease in the αSyn ﬁbril elongation rate is possible at such

low substoichiometric concentrations of Hsp70 with respect to

αSyn monomers. Importantly, variations by even 4 orders of

magnitude in the Kd,M value, between 0.09 and 90 μM, did not change the conclusions of this analysis (Figure S4).

Repeating the calculation with the assumption that Hsp70

binds to both monomers and ﬁbrils, the simulations described

well the global set of experimental data (Figure 2b, center).

Evaluation of the binding parameters (Figure S5) shows that

the aﬃnity of Hsp70 for ﬁbril ends that was obtained from the

best ﬁt (Kd,F = 9 μM) is of the same order of magnitude as the value measured experimentally for the binding of Hsp70 to the

monomer and is similar to the Kd,F value (3.1 ± 0.4 μM) that Gao et al. recently obtained under similar experimental conditions.11

An important result from this kinetic analysis is that, despite

the similar thermodynamic binding aﬃnities of Hsp70 for

monomeric and ﬁbrillar αSyn, the corresponding on-rate

constants for the binding obtained from the ﬁtting are

remarkably diﬀerent, being more than 200-fold larger for the

ﬁbrils than for the monomers. The from the analysis was 230 M−1·s−1,

value obtained experimentally under similar conditions in a

recent study (123 ± 38 M−1·s−1).11 obtained from the kinetic analysis

from the kinetic analysis.

The diﬀerence of 2 orders of magnitude in the kon value of Hsp70 between monomeric and ﬁbrillar αSyn explains why the

inhibitory eﬀect of Hsp70 is dominated by its interactions with

the ﬁbril ends even under conditions where there is an excess of

αSyn monomers. These results suggest that the competition of

the binding of Hsp70 to αSyn ﬁbrils and monomers, and

ultimately the intrinsic holdase activity of Hsp70, is primarily

modulated by kinetic rather than thermodynamic eﬀects.

To validate this conclusion, we carried out a series of

simulations where kon,M and kon,F were assumed to be equal (230 M−1·s−1), and the aﬃnity of Hsp70 for ﬁbrils was then

increased signiﬁcantly with respect to that for monomers (Kd,F = 0.18 μM, Figure 2b, graph on the right; simulations with even

lower Kd,F values yielded very similar results, data not shown). In this case, as in the previous simulations, the binding of

Hsp70 is directed to ﬁbril ends rather than to monomers, but in

contrast to previous simulations, the preference for binding to

ﬁbrils is established by thermodynamic competition. In this

scenario, the simulations are not compatible with the
experimental data (MSE = 0.54 versus MSE = 0.02 for the
model of kinetic competition). A thermodynamic preference for the binding of Hsp70 to αSyn ﬁbrils with respect to monomers is, therefore, not able to explain the high eﬃcacy of Hsp70 in the inhibition of αSyn ﬁbril elongation under conditions with a signiﬁcant excess of monomeric αSyn and at
substoichiometric concentrations of Hsp70 with respect to αSyn monomers. Overall, our analysis supports a model in which preferential interaction of Hsp70 with αSyn ﬁbrils, under
physiologically relevant conditions with ATP/ADP cycling, underlies the intrinsic ability of Hsp70 to inhibit αSyn ﬁbril
elongation. Importantly, the analysis indicates that this preferential interaction can be primarily attributed to diﬀer-
ences in the kinetics rather than the thermodynamics of the binding of the chaperone to the diﬀerent αSyn species.
There are three requirements for this kinetic inhibition to
take place. First, the concentration of chaperone needs to be at
least of the same order of magnitude as the concentration of ﬁbril ends. In our experiments, the concentration of chaperone molecules has always exceeded the concentration of ﬁbril ends. Second, in order for Hsp70 to compete eﬃciently with the addition of αSyn monomers to the ﬁbril ends and, therefore, to suppress eﬀectively αSyn ﬁbril elongation, the value of kon,F needs to be at least of the same order of magnitude as that of the ﬁbril elongation rate (k+); according to our analysis, k+ = 500 M−1·s−1 and kon,F = 230 M−1·s−1. Third, in order for Hsp70 to interact with αSyn ﬁbrils in the presence of an excess of monomers, when having similar aﬃnities for both species, the
chaperone needs to exhibit a much faster association rate for the ﬁbrils than for the monomers. Indeed, our analysis reveals that the association rate of Hsp70 for αSyn ﬁbril ends is 2
orders of magnitude greater than the rate of association for monomers. Under these conditions, a signiﬁcant fraction of ﬁbril ends is bound to chaperone molecules and they are therefore unable to bind new αSyn monomers (Figure S7).
The kon,F/kon,M ratio appears to be a key parameter for the inhibition of the elongation of ﬁbrils by Hsp70 and provides an upper boundary for the relative concentrations of αSyn monomers and ﬁbrils (CM/CF) at which Hsp70 is able to inhibit αSyn ﬁbril elongation by this kinetically driven preferential binding mechanism (CM/CF = kon,F/kon,M; i.e., CM ≈ 200CF). Below such a boundary, the chaperone can inhibit ﬁbril elongation, whereas above this threshold the faster rate of binding of Hsp70 to ﬁbril ends would not be able to compensate for the excess of monomeric αSyn.
Given that the binding of Hsp70 to proteins is hydrophobically driven,17−23 one of the reasons why the kon of Hsp70 varies with the aggregation state of αSyn could be related to the diﬀerent areas of hydrophobic surfaces that are exposed to the solvent, which is much greater in the ﬁbrillar than in the monomeric state,24,25 a feature shared with other amyloid proteins and peptides.26,27 A high level of solvent exposed hydrophobicity in the ﬁbrillar form of αSyn could result in a
relatively low energy barrier for water desolvation upon
complex formation with Hsp70, which would result in a faster
association rate. A similar mechanism of kinetically driven
competitive binding has been proposed for the association of thrombin with two ligand proteins,28 where a correlation was
observed between the entropic contribution of protein
desolvation upon complex formation and the association rate constants between the two complexes. These ﬁndings suggest that similar behavior would be expected for αSyn oligomeric

species generated during the initial stages of ﬁbril formation, as these species have been shown to possess a high degree of solvent exposed hydrophobic surface area relative to the ﬁbrillar state,24 consistent with earlier studies that suggested that binding of Hsp70 to oligomeric preﬁbrillar intermediates is critical for the inhibition of αSyn ﬁbril assembly.1,13
Our ﬁndings suggest, therefore, that a kinetically driven preferential binding mechanism, similar to that observed for αSyn ﬁbril elongation, could in addition govern the inhibition of the early stages of αSyn aggregation by Hsp70 and could represent a general mechanism by which Hsp70, and potentially other molecular chaperones, inhibits amyloid ﬁbril formation. Although the aﬃnities and rates of binding of Hsp70 to substrates are expected to vary under cellular conditions where other chaperones/cochaperones are present,11 the strong inhibitory activity of Hsp70 observed in vitro suggests that the intrinsic kinetically driven mechanism of Hsp70 inhibition of ﬁbril elongation may signiﬁcantly contribute to the overall antiaggregation activity of the chaperone in vivo. Importantly, we ﬁnd that a complex interplay exists between the kinetics and thermodynamics of binding of Hsp70 to diﬀerent types of protein aggregates. The regulation of the balance between these factors, therefore, could be a key aspect of the suppression of pathogenic events, including the nucleation and spreading of aggregate formation by molecular chaperones, and could also be an important aspect to consider in the design of future therapeutic agents targeted toward misfolding diseases.
