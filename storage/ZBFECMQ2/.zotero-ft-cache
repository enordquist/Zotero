SUMMARY
Central to the chaperone function of Hsp70s is the transition between open and closed conformations of their polypeptide substrate binding domain (SBD), which is regulated through an allosteric mechanism via ATP binding and hydrolysis in their nucleotide binding domain (NBD). Although the structure of the closed conformation of Hsp70s is well studied, the open conformation has remained elusive. Here, we report on the 2.4 A˚ crystal structure of the ATPbound open conformation of the Escherichia coli Hsp70 homolog DnaK. In the open DnaK structure, the b sheet and a-helical lid subdomains of the SBD are detached from one another and docked to different faces of the NBD. The contacts between the b sheet subdomain and the NBD reveal the mechanism of allosteric regulation. In addition, we demonstrate that docking of the b sheet and a-helical lid subdomains to the NBD is a sequential process inﬂuenced by peptide and protein substrates.
INTRODUCTION
The 70 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70) form a family of highly conserved molecular chaperones that are present in all domains of life and in most subcellular compartments of eukaryotic cells. Hsp70s, acting in concert with J domain cochaperones and nucleotide exchange factors, assist a multitude of different cellular protein-folding processes during protein maturation and quality surveillance (Kampinga and Craig, 2010; Hartl et al., 2011).
Hsp70 proteins are built up of an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal polypeptide substrate binding domain (SBD). The NBD consists of four a-b subdomains (IA, IB, IIA, and IIB) divided into two lobes by a central ATP binding cleft (Flaherty et al., 1990). The SBD is subdivided into a b sheet subdomain (SBDb), which contains the peptide binding pocket, and an a-helical subdomain (SBDa), which functions as a lid (Zhu et al., 1996). NBD and SBD are connected via a ﬂexible, highly conserved linker (Bertelsen et al., 2009).
All of Hsp70s’ functions rely on the transient interaction of their SBD with a short segment within the substrate polypeptide

(Mayer and Bukau, 2005). The afﬁnity of Hsp70s for polypeptides is regulated by the NBD. In the nucleotide-free and ADP-bound state, Hsp70’s afﬁnity for substrates is high, but substrate binding and release rates are low. ATP binding increases peptide association and dissociation rates by two and three orders of magnitude, respectively, decreasing the afﬁnity for substrates by 10- to 50-fold (Schmid et al., 1994; Mayer et al., 2000b). ATP hydrolysis is essential for Hsp70 chaperones, but the intrinsic ATPase rate is very low. This ATPase activity is stimulated by protein substrates in synergism with J domain cochaperones (Karzai and McMacken, 1996; Laufen et al., 1999). Thus, NBD and SBD are linked in a mutual allosteric control mechanism, the understanding of which has remained sketchy due to the lack of a structure in which SBD and NBD are properly docked.
Recently, the structure of the yeast Hsp110, Sse1, a distant relative of Hsp70s, was solved and was suggested to represent the open conformation of Hsp70s (Liu and Hendrickson, 2007). However, Hsp110 proteins act as nucleotide exchange factors for Hsp70s (Dragovic et al., 2006; Raviol et al., 2006) and do not seem to require allosteric regulation between domains. Although Hsp110s are able to hydrolyze ATP, at least some of them do not depend on it (Raviol et al., 2006). Therefore, the open conformation of ATP-bound Hsp70s has remained a matter of debate. Here, we solve the structure of the ATP-bound open conformation of the Escherichia coli Hsp70 DnaK.
RESULTS
Stabilization of the ATP-Bound Open Conformation of DnaK Many attempts to determine the structure of the ATP-bound open conformation of Hsp70s have failed in the past, most likely due to their highly dynamic nature. Therefore, we strived to stabilize the open conformation by using a disulﬁde bond. On the basis of a homology model of DnaK using the Sse1 structure as a template and on hydrogen-exchange data (Figure S1 available online), we created double-cysteine variants of DnaK by introducing cysteines at position 47 in the NBD and at different positions along helix B of the SBD, between positions 525 and 541. In addition, we removed the last 32 residues, which are known to be highly ﬂexible and are not essential for the in vivo and in vitro function of DnaK (Zhu et al., 1996), and replaced them with a hexahistidine tag. We tested the constructs in vivo for complementation of the temperature sensitivity phenotype

of a DdnaK strain and found that all DnaK constructs were fully functional (data not shown).
We then tested which of these DnaK variants could form an intramolecular disulﬁde in the presence of ATP (Figure 1A). We took advantage of the fact that DnaK species with intramolecular crosslink appear on SDS gel as bands with a higher molecular weight than that of wild-type DnaK. Intramolecular disulﬁde bond formation was also veriﬁed by using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (Figure S2). DnaK-E47C,D526C and DnaK-E47C,F529C formed an intramolecular disulﬁde in the presence of ATP with much higher efﬁciency than other variants. This is consistent with the DnaKSse1 model, wherein Asp526 and Phe529 are closest to Glu47 as compared to other residues in helix B (Table S1).
To further validate our model, we searched for positions in NBD and SBDb suitable for disulﬁde bonds. The closest distances were found between residue pairs E80-A449, R167A480, and D326-N415 (Table S1). Only DnaK-R167C,A480C formed a disulﬁde bond efﬁciently in the presence of ATP (Figure 1A).Taken together, the disulﬁde crosslinking results support our model of the open conformation.
DnaK Can Assume an Open Conformation in the Nucleotide-free State We next asked whether the open, Sse1-like conformation is only accessed in the ATP-bound state or also in the nucleotide-free state. Disulﬁdes between SBDa and NBD (47–526 and 47–529) and between SBDb and NBD (167–480) also formed efﬁciently in the absence of nucleotide (Figure 1A, right panel). This is very surprising, because nuclear magnetic resonance data suggested that NBD and SBD are instead disjoined in the absence of ATP (Swain et al., 2007; Bertelsen et al., 2009). Our ﬁnding demonstrates that docking of helix B and SBDb to the NBD also occurs in the nucleotide-free state. This result is consistent with recently published data, which indicate that in all nucleotide states of the Hsp70s, ‘‘open’’ and ‘‘closed’’ conformations coexist, though in different proportions (Marcinowski et al., 2011; Schlecht et al., 2011). We resolved the oxidation kinetics for DnaK-E47C,D526C and found that ATP accelerated intramolecular disulﬁde formation roughly 2-fold and decreased the fraction of intermolecular crosslinks (Figures 1B and 1C).

address this question, we attempted to determine whether the respective residues are closer in the ATP state than in the ADP state using ﬂuorescence spectroscopy. We had previously found that two molecules of the environment-sensitive dye HiLyte Fluor 488 quench each other’s ﬂuorescence when in close proximity (Graf et al., 2009). Using polyprolyl peptides as a molecular ruler, we show now that ﬂuorescence quenching is observed when two dyes are closer together than 16 A˚ (Figure S3). As shown in Figure 1D, the equilibrium ﬂuorescence intensity of double-labeled DnaK variants is quenched upon

the addition of ATP, and the extent of this quenching correlates well with the distances measured in our homology model (Table S1), taking the orientation of the respective residues and the linker between the thiol attachment and the center of the dye into consideration.
Tryptophane Fluorescence To further validate that the disulﬁde-bonded DnaK variants represent a conformation prevalent in the ATP-bound state, we used tryptophane ﬂuorescence. DnaK has a single tryptophane situated in the NBD (Trp102; see Figure S1), which responds to ATP-induced conformational changes with a shift of the maximum of ﬂuorescence emission by 3–4 nm toward shorter wavelengths (Theyssen et al., 1996). This shift is not observed when helices A and B are deleted (Moro et al., 2003), suggesting that helix B comes into close proximity with Trp102.
Reduced DnaK-E47C,D526C and DnaK-E47C,F529C had wild-type-like tryptophane spectra, with an emission maximum in the nucleotide-free state of around 348 nm (right end of the bar shown in Figure 2A) and an ATP-induced blueshift of $4 nm (size of the bar in Figure 2A). Interestingly, the maximum in tryptophane ﬂuorescence of oxidized DnaK-E47C,D526C and DnaK-E47C,F529C was already strongly shifted toward a shorter wavelength in the absence of ATP, and the emission maximum was in a region comparable to wild-type DnaK in the presence of ATP, indicating that linking helix B to the NBD leads to changes in Trp102’s surroundings similar to those induced by binding of ATP. Addition of ATP to the oxidized form of DnaKE47C,D526C and DnaK-E47C,F529C shifted the emission maximum by about 1 nm further, to a shorter wavelength.
In contrast to helix B double-cysteine constructs, DnaKR167C,A480C did not exhibit a signiﬁcant ATP-induced blueshift in either the reduced or the oxidized state. The maximum of ﬂuorescence was positioned around 349 nm, which corresponds to the emission maximum of wild-type DnaK in the nucleotide-free state. This result was not surprising, given that it was shown previously that Arg167 is engaged in interdomain communication and that replacement of this residue leads to a loss of allostery (Vogel et al., 2006). These results indicate that linking of SBDb to the NBD does not automatically lead to docking of SBDa with the NBD.
ATPase Activity To verify the functionality of the DnaK constructs, which formed an intramolecular disulﬁde bond, we determined the ATPase activity under single turnover conditions. Wild-type DnaK had a very low intrinsic ATPase rate of 5 3 10À4 sÀ1, consistent with published data (McCarty et al., 1995). This rate could be stimulated 1.7-fold by 1 mM of the natural substrate heat-shock transcription factor s32 of E. coli and $7-fold by low concentration of DnaJ (50 nM). In the presence of s32 and DnaJ, a 32-fold synergistic stimulation was observed, consistent with earlier results (Laufen et al., 1999). Both oxidized and reduced forms of DnaK-E47C,F529C hydrolyzed ATP with a basal rate similar to wild-type DnaK (Figure 2B). Reduced DnaK-E47C,F529C responded to the ATPase stimulation both by DnaJ alone and together with the substrate in a wild-type-like manner. The ATPase activity of oxidized DnaK-E47C,F529C was also

stimulated by the substrate and DnaJ, albeit to a lesser extent (1.4-, 3-, and 10-fold for s32, DnaJ, and s32+DnaJ, respectively). Oxidized DnaK-E47C,F529C is clearly competent for hydrolysis of ATP and for response to the signals of DnaJ and substrate.
DnaK-R167C,A480C in the reduced state showed 7-foldincreased basal ATPase activity in comparison with wild-type DnaK (Figure 2C), and stimulation by DnaJ alone was not observed, consistent with data implicating Arg167 in interaction with DnaJ (Suh et al., 1998). Unexpectedly, oxidized DnaKR167C,A480C had a basal ATPase rate of 9.2 3 10À3 sÀ1, which is close to the values observed for the wild-type protein when stimulated synergistically by DnaJ and s32. Obviously, oxidation of this DnaK variant results in a conformation that brings in close proximity residues from SBDb and NBD that are necessary for full stimulation of the ATPase activity.
Structure of the Open Conformation of DnaK Because all functional data indicated that linking SBDa to the NBD produces a conformation similar to the one prevalent in the ATP-bound state, we tried to solve the structure of this conformation. To crystallize DnaK in the ATP-bound open conformation, we combined the cysteine replacements E47C,D526C and E47C,F529C with the Thr199 to alanine replacement (T199A) in the nucleotide binding pocket. The T199A replacement reduces the ATPase activity at least 10-

fold but retains wild-type-like allosteric regulation between NBD and SBD (Barthel et al., 2001; Rist et al., 2006).
Both oxidized triple-amino-acid replacement variants were used in crystallization trials in the presence of ATP, but only DnaK-E47C,T199A,F529C yielded suitable crystals. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and reﬁned at 2.4 A˚ resolution to an R value of 19.9% (Rfree = 23.6%; Table 1). There were four DnaK$ATP molecules in the asymmetric unit, forming two head-to-head symmetric dimers (Figure S4). The four DnaK molecules have fairly distinct crystal-packing contacts but their structures are highly similar, indicating that the observed structure is not compromised by crystal packing.
To test whether DnaK$ATP is also a dimer in solution, we performed size-exclusion chromatography coupled to static light scattering (Figure S4) with oxidized and reduced DnaKE47C,T199A,F529C in the presence of ATP. Even at high concentrations of 50 mM, only very little dimer was found, which argues against a hypothesis that the dimeric conformation found in the crystals is a physiologically relevant state. Overall Structure of DnaK$ATP and Comparison to Sse1 and to DnaK$ADP In the ATP-bound open conformation, DnaK is composed of three folding units, the NBD and the two subdomains of the SBD, SBDb, and SBDa, which are detached from each other and contact different sides of the NBD (Figure 3A). The NBD shows the typical actin-like fold found in Hsp70s and the structure of all four subdomains (IA, IB, IIA, and IIB) are highly similar to previously solved structures, but their orientation relative to each other is signiﬁcantly different. The SBDb forms a twolayered b sandwich with upward protruding loops and contacts the NBD subdomains IA, IB, and IIA. The SBDa consists of four helices, the ﬁrst of which is bound to the side of NBD subdomain IB as expected from the disulﬁde bond between position 47 and 529. This overall arrangement of the DnaK$ATP structure resembles the previously solved Sse1 structure (Figure 3B) (Liu and Hendrickson, 2007). However, there are signiﬁcant differences, which are important for the allosteric coupling of NBD and SBD in Hsp70s. The most striking difference is the orientation of the SBDb, which is moved upward by about 20 and sideways toward the subdomain IIA by 25 as compared to Sse1 (Figure 3B). As discussed in detail below, there are six polar contact sites in DnaK between SBDb and NBD, of which only three are found in Sse1. Additional differences are found in the position of the NBD subdomains relative to each other and in the SBD subdomains (Supplemental Information).
Compared to the solution structure of DnaK in the ADP state (Bertelsen et al., 2009), the differences are much more pronounced (Figure 3C). In the ADP state, NBD and SBD appear as two separate units that do not seem to contact each other (Swain et al., 2007), and helices A and B of SBDa are packed tightly onto SBDb. In the ATP state, helices A and B form a continuous helix. The difference in the NBD between DnaK$ATP and DnaK$ADP is also much more substantial than the differences between DnaK and Sse1 NBDs. Nucleotide Binding Domain Many structures of isolated NBDs of Hsp70s in the absence of nucleotides and in the presence of ADP, ATP, or AMP-PNP have been solved in the past twenty years. Surprisingly, all of

structure. Fourth, the hydrophobic pocket in the SBDb, which is tailored for binding a single hydrophobic residue, is much smaller in our structure than in the previous substrate-containing structure (Figure 5C). The minimal distance between the side chains of the pocket-lining residues Phe426 and Ile438 is reduced by almost 3 A˚ (see Supplemental Information).
Except for the missing kink between helices A and B, the SBDa is very similar to the previous structure of DnaK’s isolated SBD (root-mean-square deviation = 0.839 A˚ , helices B–E). In contrast, it deviates signiﬁcantly from the SBDa of Sse1 (Figure 3B).

NBD-SBD Contacts The interaction surface between SBDb and the NBD involves three of the four subdomains of the NBD (IA, IB, and IIA). Of the SBDb, six regions are involved in the interactions: the highly conserved linker between NBD and SBD, the loop L2,3, the end of b strand 4, the loop L6,7, strand 7, and the linker between strand 8 and the SBDa. The interdomain linker hydrogen bonds with strand 13 of the NBD, thereby extending the central b sheet of subdomain IIA. Linker residue Asp393 is in hydrogen-bond (H-bond) distance to Asn170 and Thr173 of the loop between

strand 10 of the central b sheet of subdomain IA and the last helix of IA, which crosses over to subdomain IIA (Figure 5D). The second site involves Lys414 and Asn415 of loop L2,3 of the SBDb and Asp326 at the end of helix 10 of subdomain IIA (Figure 5E). In addition, Asn415 is at H-bond distance to the backbone amide of Thr221 of strand 13 of the NBD. The third contact is formed between Gln442 from the end of b strand 4 of SBDb and the backbone amide of Asp148 (IA) (Figure 5F). The fourth interaction involves the side chain of Asp481, which is at H-bond distance to the backbone of Ile168 and forms a polar contact with Arg167 (Figure 5F). In addition, Arg151 hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of Asp481. The ﬁfth site is formed between the side chain of Asp148 (IA) and the backbone amide of Leu484 in strand 7 of SBDb (Figure 5F). Finally, Ser505 and Gly506 of the linker between SBDb and SBDa contact Asn98 and Asp100 in subdomain IB. As discussed in the Supplemental Information, many of the sites involved in interdomain contacts

were previously found to be involved in allosteric regulation. Only three of the six NBD-SBD contact sites are found in Sse1 (Supplemental Information), which suggests why Sse1 does not possess an allosteric mechanism similar to Hsp70s.
Dynamics of the Open Structure Resolving the Kinetics of the ATP-Induced Conformational Changes in DnaK Because our ﬂuorescent probes were responsive to ATPinduced distance changes between SBDa and NBD IB and SBDb and NBD (Figure 1D), we decided to resolve the kinetics of these conformational changes in DnaK. As shown above, ATP binding causes three major rearrangements: (1) complete relocation of helix B and its docking to the NBD; (2) docking of the b sheet subdomain of SBD to NBD; and (3) binding of the interdomain linker in a hydrophobic groove of the NBD. Until now, the sequence of these events was not resolved. To solve

(E) Comparison of the rates for ATP-induced NRpeptide release and ATP-induced SBDa-NBD docking for DnaK-E47C variant in the absence (-pep) and presence (+pep) of a peptide. Error bars are SEM of at least three measurements.

this problem, we used labeled DnaK variants and followed the change in ﬂuorescence as a function of time using a stopped-ﬂow device. Of the three b sheet double-cysteine variants, only DnaK-E80C,A449C behaved like wild-type DnaK in ATPase activity and ATP-induced substrate release. Therefore, we used this variant to measure the docking kinetics of SBDb to NBD.
We could not use E47C-D526C and E47C-F529C to determine the docking rates of helix B to the NBD, because Asp526 and Phe529 are important for the proper mechanics of the SBD, and their replacement by cysteine leads to increased substrate release rates (Schlecht et al., 2011; Figure S7). Instead, we used HiLyte Fluor 488-labeled DnaK-E47C, which had wildtype-like substrate release rates (Figures S7B and S7C) and showed an increase in ﬂuorescence upon the addition of ATP due to the dye’s sensitivity to polarity changes in its vicinity. In addition, we used DnaK-E217C,L392C to measure docking of the linker into the hydrophobic groove of the NBD.
All three reactions—ATP-induced docking of SBDb, linker, and helix B to the NBD—followed double-exponential kinetics with a fast phase of 8.3 sÀ1 (SBDa), 27.9 sÀ1 (SBDb), and 107 sÀ1 (linker) (Figure 6B). These results indicate that, upon ATP binding, ﬁrst the linker inserts into the hydrophobic groove of the NBD and then the SBDb binds, followed by helix B. This suggests that relocation of helix B depends on the docking of the linker and SBDb to the NBD. Substrates Affect the Mechanics of the Helical Lid We wondered whether peptide and protein substrates bound to DnaK would have any effect on the ATP-induced relocation of helix B. It was shown previously that the lid is in a more open position when a protein substrate is bound as compared to a bound peptide substrate (Schlecht et al., 2011). We used

labeled DnaK-E47C to prepare complexes with NR-peptide (NRLLLTG) and s32. Then, we rapidly mixed the DnaK-substrate complexes with ATP and followed the increase of ﬂuorescence with time (Figure 6C). Both NR-peptide and s32 strongly decreased the ATP-induced docking of helix B to the NBD (Figure 6D).
We also compared the kinetics of the ATP-induced dissociation of a peptide using a ﬂuorescent-labeled variant of NRpeptide and ATP-induced helix B-to-NBD docking (Figure 6E). To our great surprise, the peptide release rate was 18-fold higher than the rate for docking of the lid to the NBD in the presence of a peptide. Thus, at the moment when helix B docks onto NBD, the substrate is already released from DnaK.
DISCUSSION
In this study we solved several key issues of the molecular mechanism of Hsp70 chaperones. We found that in ATP as well as in ADP and the nucleotide-free state, Hsp70s can assume an open conformation with SBDa detached from SBDb, and both subdomains of the SBD dock onto different sides of the NBD. The inter-NBD-SBDb contacts revealed by our structure suggest an allosteric mechanism of interdomain communication—in particular, how substrate binding can inﬂuence ATP hydrolysis. In addition, our structure indicates a catalytic mechanism for g-phosphate cleavage that is different from the previously proposed mechanism. Our kinetic measurements demonstrate that the highly conserved interdomain linker ﬁrst inserts into a hydrophobic groove between subdomains IA and IIA of the NBD, then SBDb docks onto the NBD, and subsequently SBDa follows suit. Furthermore, bound substrates decrease the rate of SBDa-NBD docking, and this rate is surprisingly

much lower than peptide-dissociation rates, indicating that once SBDa contacts the NBD, substrates are no longer in the substrate binding pocket.
Several lines of evidence verify that our crystal structure represents an open conformation relevant for the ATP state of Hsp70s: (1) cysteines in only two positions in helix B (SBDa) formed efﬁciently intramolecular disulﬁde bonds to a cysteine in the NBD, indicating that these disulﬁde bonds are speciﬁc; (2) oxidized DnaK-E47C,F529C and DnaK-E47C,D526C exhibit tryptophane-ﬂuorescence emission maxima similar to that of wild-type DnaK in the ATP-bound state; (3) cysteines in positions 167 and 480 in NBD and SBDb, which are relatively close in our structure, are also able to form disulﬁde bonds; (4) ﬂuorescence labels introduced in the different positions show an ATPdependent quenching, indicating distances of less than 16 A˚ , consistent with our structure; and (5) many residues involved in interdomain contacts in our structure have been shown previously to be important for in vivo function of DnaK, and for some of these residues, it was demonstrated that replacement leads to a loss of allosteric control (see detailed discussion in the Supplemental Information).
This ATP-bound open conformation of Hsp70s resembles the conformation of their distant relatives and nucleotide exchange factors, Hsp110. Such a similarity was previously proposed (Liu and Hendrickson, 2007) and was supported by complementation assays. However, as discussed in detail in the Supplemental Information, there are signiﬁcant differences between the structures. Our data indicate that Hsp70 is more dynamic in the ATP-bound state and that docking of the SBDa with the NBD is a transient event. Dissociation of this interaction is a prerequisite for the high substrate and DnaJ-stimulated ATPase rate. Sse1 seems to be frozen in this open conformation, and thereby to have lost its allosteric control mechanism.
Surprisingly, we discovered that Hsp70s can assume such an open conformation even in the ADP-bound and nucleotide-free states. These ﬁndings are consistent with the observation that substrate binding and release is possible in the absence of ATP (Schmid et al., 1994; Pierpaoli et al., 1998; Mayer et al., 2000b) and that the distance distribution in the high-afﬁnity state includes a population with an SBDa-to-SBDb distance of more than 25 A˚ (Marcinowski et al., 2011; Schlecht et al., 2011). However, it is completely unexpected that lid opening in the nucleotide-free state involves detachment of SBDa and docking of SBDa and SBDb to different sites of the NBD. Note that detachment of SBDa from SBDb is not necessary for substrate binding but for allosteric regulation, because a disulﬁde bridge between helix A of SBDa and SBDb leads to a complete loss of allosteric regulation, but not loss of substrate binding (Schlecht et al., 2011). Our ﬁndings are consistent with a hypothesis proposed earlier that the difference between high-afﬁnity and low-afﬁnity states of Hsp70s is not the actual conformation but the frequency of transition between the open and closed conformations and their relative abundance (Mayer et al., 2000a). This is reﬂected in our ﬂuorescence-quenching experiments, which indicated a closer average distance between SBDa and NBD and between SBDb and NBD in the presence of ATP.
Based on these and previously published data from many laboratories, we propose the following action cycle for Hsp70

(Figure 7A). In the nucleotide-free state, closed and open conformation of Hsp70s are in equilibrium (see also Figure 3C), with a majority of molecules at any given time being closed. ATPbinding shifts this equilibrium toward the open conformation, whereby the subdomains of the NBD are rotated relative to the closed conformation to accommodate the interactions with the different regions of SBDb. SBDa docks onto the NBD but, in contrast to the situation in Hsp110 chaperones, does not remain stably bound. Frequent excursions to the closed state occur. These are necessary for effective ATP hydrolysis, as evidenced by the reduced substrate and DnaJ-stimulated ATPase rates of oxidized DnaK-E47C,F529C (Figure 2B), and thus for substrate trapping. Substrate binding has two effects on the substrate binding site: (1) the substrate-enclosing loops come closer together due to hydrogen bonding with the backbone of the substrate, resulting in a narrowing of the angle between strands 1 and 4 of the SBDb (see Movie S2); and (2) insertion of the central hydrophobic residue into the substrate binding pocket, which requires strands 3 and 4 to move apart (Figure 7B, Movie S3). Both changes are transmitted to the NBD-contacting residues, releasing the NBD-SBD linker as demonstrated earlier (Rist et al., 2006) and affecting the rotation of the NBD subdomains relative to each other. Concomitantly, the positions of g-phosphate coordinating residues including Lys70 and Glu171 shift, which ultimately triggers g-phosphate cleavage. ATP hydrolysis, in turn, allows further rotation of the NBD subdomains, thereby weakening the contact sites between NBD and SBDb, and thus promotes dissociation of the two domains. Nucleotide exchange returns Hsp70 to the groundstate equilibrium.
How is ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by Hsp70s? In our structure, due to the subdomain rotation within the NBD, Lys70 is displaced by more than 2 A˚ as compared to all previous NBD structures of wild-type and mutant Hsp70s, and its amino group is positioned at H-bond distance to the g-phosphate. This suggests that the function of Lys70 is to stabilize the pentavalent transition state of the phosphate during hydrolysis and not to position a water or hydroxyl ion for the inline attack as previously proposed (Flaherty et al., 1994; Wilbanks et al., 1994; O’Brien et al., 1996). Lys70 therefore has a similar function as the arginine ﬁnger in GTPases (Scheffzek et al., 1997) and other ATPases (Nadanaciva et al., 1999). In contrast, our structure suggests that Glu171, which is also displaced by almost 2 A˚ as compared to previous structures, coordinates the attacking water and acts as an acceptor for the released proton. Thr199, which is missing in our structure, may be involved in guiding the water to the g-phosphate.
What is the function of DnaJ in this catalytic mechanism? Our ATPase assays with the oxidized DnaK-R167C,A480C suggest a hypothesis. Even in the absence of substrate and DnaJ, this variant had an ATPase rate that was almost as high as the substrate and DnaJ-stimulated ATPase rate of wild-type DnaK (Figure 2C). Substrate-induced release of the linker might weaken the SBDb-NBD interaction, and binding of the J domain of DnaJ in the vicinity of Arg167, as suggested by genetic and biochemical data (Suh et al., 1998; Vogel et al., 2006), might clamp SBDb and NBD together to prevent premature dissociation of the two domains. In oxidized DnaK-R167C,A480C,

a dissociation of SBDb and NBD is not possible, resulting in a high ATPase rate.
Our ﬂuorescence data revealed additional insights into the mechanism of Hsp70s. Bound substrates slowed the SBDa-NBD docking rate signiﬁcantly. Given that substrate dissociation rates were much higher than SBDa-NBD docking rates, substrates appear to affect the mechanics of the SBDb to allow full interaction only after complete substrate dissociation. This ﬁnding may have very important implications for the regulation of the chaperone cycle of Hsp70s. The processed substrate must be able to escape before Hsp70 assumes a conformation competent for hydrolysis of the newly bound ATP. Otherwise, the substrate would be immediately entrapped by the chaperone for the next cycle, the substrate may not have a chance to reach the native state, and the chaperone may perform futile cycles of ATP hydrolysis. The fully opened lid may be an important signal for the NBD that the protein is in the optimal conformation for ATP hydrolysis. This assumption is consistent with the observation that ATPase activity of DnaK is poorly stimulated by substrate and DnaJ when the lid is crosslinked to the SBDb (Schlecht et al., 2011). However, this hypothesis seems at odds with our ATPase experiments with oxidized DnaK-E47C,F529C, which is arrested in the SBDa-NBD-docked conformation and has lower ATPase rates in the presence of substrate and DnaJ than does wild-type DnaK or the same variant in the reduced state. Therefore, the docking of the SBDa may be a transient event necessary for allowing ATP to reach the hydrolysis competent position in the nucleotide binding pocket. Closing of the lid over the bound substrate may be the ﬁnal signal that allows ATP hydrolysis. Such a mechanism would be most effective in trapping misfolded polypeptides.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Plasmids and Proteins The dnaK mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1991) and expressed in pUHE21-2fdD12 (Buchberger et al., 1994) or in pMPM-A4 (Mayer, 1995). All DnaK variants were produced with a C-terminal His6-tag in E. coli BB1553 strain (MC4100 DdnaK52 sidB1, Bukau and Walker, 1990) harboring plasmid pDMI.1(lacIq) (Bujard and Lanzer, 1994) by induction with either 1 mM IPTG or 0.2% L-(+)-arabinose at 30C. The protein was puriﬁed using Ni-IDA matrix (Protino, Macherey-Nagel), washed with Buffer A (40 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 100 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazol), and then washed with Buffer A containing 5 mM ATP and 5 mM MgCl2. Bound proteins were eluted with 500 mM imidazol in Buffer A. Bound nucleotides were removed from the protein as described (Theyssen et al., 1996). His6-s32 was puriﬁed according to Arse` ne et al. (1999). DnaJ was a kind gift from Dr. F. Rodriguez.

Crystallization of DnaK-E47C-T199A-F529Cox in the ATP-Bound State DnaK-E47C,T199A,F529C was puriﬁed as described above with few modiﬁcations. After Ni-IDA puriﬁcation, the protein was oxidized in the presence of 5 mM ATP, and the nucleotide was not removed. Subsequently, the protein was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography as described (Buchberger et al., 1994). For removal of the intermolecular crosslinking products from intramolecular ones, the protein was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on the Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in HNKMG buffer (40 mM HEPES [pH 7.6], 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol). Afterward, the protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml and subjected to crystallization (for crystallization conditions, data collection, and reﬁnement see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
ATPase and Fluorescence Assays ATPase Activity Single-turnover ATPase rates were determined as described (Mayer et al., 1999). Tryptophan Fluorescence Tryptophan-emission spectra (300–400 nm) of DnaK (3 mM in HKM) were measured at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm on a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrometer. Probing the Relative Interdomain Distances Fluorescence-emission spectra of HiLyte Fluor 488-labeled DnaK variants (1 mM in HKM buffer) were recorded from 500 to 580 nm (excitation 488 nm) at 30C in the absence and in the presence of 1 mM ATP (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Kinetics of the ATP-Induced Conformational Changes One micromolar of labeled DnaK alone or in complex with substrate was rapidly mixed 1:1 with 1 mM ATP in HKM buffer at 30C in a stopped-ﬂow device (SX.18 MV, Applied Photophysics; excitation wavelength 488 nm; cutoff ﬁlter 530 nm). Peptide Dissociation Kinetics Basal and ATP-induced peptide dissociation rates were determined as described previously, except that D-NR peptide (NRLLLTGC labeled with dansyl chloride) was used (Mayer et al., 2000b; Ga¨ ssler et al., 2001).
