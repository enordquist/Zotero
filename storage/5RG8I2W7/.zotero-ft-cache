ABSTRACT: The new empirical rules for protein pKa predictions implemented in the PROPKA3.0 software package (Olsson et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010, 7, 525À537) have been extended to the prediction of pKa shifts of active site residues and ionizable ligand groups in proteinÀligand complexes. We present new algorithms that allow pKa shifts due to inductive (i.e., covalently coupled) intraligand interactions, as well as noncovalently coupled interligand interactions in multiligand complexes, to be included in the prediction. The number of diﬀerent ligand chemical groups that are automatically recognized has been increased to 18, and the general implementation has been changed so that new functional groups can be added easily by the user, aided by a new and more general protonation scheme. Except for a few cases, the new algorithms in PROPKA3.1 are found to yield results similar to or better than those obtained with PROPKA2.0 (Bas et al. Proteins: Struct., Funct., Bioinf. 2008, 73, 765À783). Finally, we present a novel algorithm that identiﬁes noncovalently coupled ionizable groups, where pKa prediction may be especially diﬃcult. This is a general improvement to PROPKA and is applied to proteins with and without ligands.

1. INTRODUCTION
The interactions between biological molecules are fundamental to all biological phenomena. The often high degree of speciﬁcity of the intermolecular interactions oﬀers a high level of control in basic biological processes such as the humoral immune response (antibodyÀantigen interactions), gene regulation (proteinÀDNA interactions), and enzyme catalysis (initial enzymeÀsubstrate binding). Similarly, most drugs are small molecules that bind to protein targets. In the early steps of the drug discovery process, thousands of candidate molecules are often screened for activity on the protein target in an expensive and time-consuming process. Accurate modeling of proteinÀligand interactions is therefore of great importance and has practical applications in the pharmaceutical industry where virtual screening for drug candidates is of increasing importance.1
A great number of computer algorithms have been developed for modeling interactions between ligands and protein molecules.2 However, much less eﬀort has been devoted to the prediction of titrational events during proteinÀligand binding.3À5 When a ligand binds to a protein receptor, the chemical environment of the ligand and the active site residues is changed. This can result in titrational events on the ligand molecule6 and in the active site, which inﬂuences the binding aﬃnity of the ligand molecule to the protein receptor. Hence, the prediction of ligand pKa values can be of great importance for the accurate modeling of these events.
In this Article, we announce the new version 3.1 of PROPKA,5,7,8 which features a number of improvements with particular focus on prediction of ligand pKa values. The previous version 2.0 of PROPKA models interactions between protein and ligand chemical groups. However, PROPKA2.0 has a number of shortcomings that we will seek remedy in the present PROPKA3.1.
While the previous version 2.0 of PROPKA supported modeling of interactions between protein and ligand molecules, no

modeling of interactions between ligand groups was available. This shortcoming can lead to errors in predicted pKa values for systems with multiple ligand molecules complexed with a protein, systems containing large ligand molecules including several titratable groups, or systems containing ligand molecules that are coordinated with monatomic ions.
Additionally, PROPKA3.1 takes inductive interactions between covalently coupled ligand groups into account. For two covalently coupled groups in an aromatic ring, it can be the case that a titrational event at one of the covalently coupled groups renders a titrational event at the other group much less likely. As the molecular environment of the two groups is often similar, it is often the chemical environment of the groups that determines which group will titrate. PROPKA3.1 models covalently coupled titrational events by identifying groups that are not titrating due to coupling with another titrational event and restricting these groups to the neutral state.
In PROPKA3.1, we have furthermore implemented algorithms for the modeling of noncovalently coupled titrational events. Two titratable groups, residing in a protein or ligand, that are spatially proximate can inﬂuence the titration of each other such that the two groups titrate in a coupled fashion and that the shape of the titration curves can deviate from the standard HendersonÀHasselbalch shape.9,10 Such noncovalently coupled titration curves have, for example, been observed for Bacillus circulans xylanase11 and thioredoxins.12À14 These noncovalently coupled titration events can be considered a combination of two microscopic titrational events where either of the two groups can titrate ﬁrst. PROPKA3.1 models noncovalently coupled titrational events by predicting the resulting pKa values in both of the two possible titration orders.

Finally, the implementation of the PROPKA versions 3.0 and 3.1 in Python15 makes it a relatively easy task to modify and extend the code to include new chemical groups.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Calculation Workflow. The workflow of PROPKA3.1 is sketched in Figure 1. When initialized with a .pdb file as argument, the workflow of PROPKA3.1 is as follows: (i) The structure PDB file is read into PROPKA3.1, taking into account multiple models and alternative locations, and a series of checks is done to ensure structural consistency, for example, that known protein residues contain the expected number of atoms. The assignment of Sybyl atom types to ligand atoms is done internally in PROPKA3.1 based solely on atom elements and coordinates. For a list of recognized Sybyl types, see Table 1. (ii) Chemical bonds are initialized on the basis of atom coordinates and element types. Atoms separated by less than 2.0 Å are generally assumed to be bonded. However, if one of the two atoms is a hydrogen atom, the threshold is 1.5 Å, and for disulfides the threshold is 2.5 Å. Information on π-electrons and conjugated bonds is set up using table values for protein atom names and ligand Sybyl types. Protons are added as described below. (iii) The chemical groups needed for the pKa calculation are identified from the atoms that have been read in. For protein atoms, the identification of chemical groups is based on atom names, and for heterogeneous atoms, the identification is based on predicted Sybyl types. Besides the ligand groups recognized by PROPKA2.0,5 two additional groups are recognized in PROPKA3.1: titratable oxygen atoms in phosphate groups (default model pKa value 6.0 was set on the basis of a series of experimental pKa values for molecules containing phosphate groups16) and thiol groups (default model pKa value 10.017); confer Table 2. (iv) Covalently coupled groups are identified as described below. (v) A .propka_input file is written out, allowing the user to modify the standard PROPKA3.1 setup. (vi) The pKa value calculation is done using the algorithm described

in ref 7 expanded to also include ligand atoms as described below.

(vii) Noncovalently coupled groups are identified as described

below. (viii) A resulting .pka file is written out. 2.2. pKa Shifts Due to Ligand Interactions. In the following,
a brief summary of the underlying algorithms in PROPKA3.1 is

given with focus on the extension of the parameter set to include

ligand groups. For more details on the theoretical considerations

that PROPKA3.1 is based on, please consult ref 7.

In PROPKA3.1, pKa values are modeled as:

pKa ¼ pKawater þ ΔpKawater f protein

ð1Þ

where (often

pKawater referred

is the to as

pKa value the model

of the titratable group in water pKa value), and ΔpKawaterfprotein

is the contribution to the pKa value that stems from the protein

environment of the group. While the former value is a table value

for protein residues, it will, for ligand groups, depend on the

chemical properties of the molecule that the group is a part of.

Hence, the default model pKa values in Table 2 for ligand groups are only proximate and should be replaced if a more precise value

is known for the considered ligand molecule. The latter value is

predicted by PROPKA3.1 on the basis of the supplied structure

and consists of

ΔpKawater f protein ¼ ΔpKadesolv þ ΔpKaHB þ ΔpKaRE þ ΔpKaQ Q ð2Þ

where ΔpKadesolv is the contribution due to desolvation eﬀects, ΔpKaHB is the contribution due to hydrogen-bond interactions, ΔpKaRE is the contribution due to unfavorable electrostatic reorganization energies, and ΔpKaQQ is the contribution due to Coulombic interactions. Of these four terms only the hydrogen

bond and Coulombic contributions are calculated using group-

speciﬁc parameters. The remaining terms are calculated using

generic parameters and do therefore not need to be extended

with new parameters to allow modeling of ligand groups.

where rmin and rmax are group-specific cutoff distances found by analysis of hydrogen-bond distances found in X-ray protein
structures. The generic maximal intrinsic interaction energy, cHB, was set
to 0.85 for all interactions involving ligand groups. However, to
achieve consistency with PROPKA3.0, strong, buried interac-
tions between histidine residues and ligand carboxylic groups are assigned an initial interaction energy, cHB, of 1.6 pKa units similarly to interactions between Asp/Glu and His residues.5,7
Because of the relatively limited amount of structures containing hydrogen-bond interactions between protein and speciﬁc ligand groups, cutoﬀ distances for ligand groups have been set by
extrapolating the existing parameters in PROPKA3.0 for protein groups. Interaction distance cutoﬀs are set to the values of similar
protein residue groups, confer Table 3; for example, the distance
parameters of guanidinium and amidinium groups are set to the
values of the arginine residue. In those cases where no equivalent
protein group exists, the default distance parameters of cmin = 3.0 Å and cmax = 4.0 Å were applied.
2.2.2. Coulombic Interactions. The contribution to the pKa value of group i due to the Coulombic interaction between groups i and j is calculated as7

ΔpKaQ, iQ ¼ σij2ε4ri4j wðrijÞ

ð5Þ

where 244 is the coefficient of Coulomb’s law converted into pKa
units, w(rij) is a weight function, and rij is the distance between groups i and j. The dielectric constant, ε, is in this context a

function of the degree of solvent exposure as explained in detail

in ref 7. A unit step function, σij, is determining the sign of the contribution to the pKa value of group i. The unit step function for the Coulombic interaction between groups i and j is

defined as

if i is acid and j is base or i and j are bases and pKa, i < pKa, j

σij

¼

>>>>>>>:

þ1 0

if i is base and j is acid or i and j are acids and pKa, i > pKa, j
otherwise

ð6Þ

In some cases, the contribution of Coulombic interactions to the pKa value depends on the total pKa values of the interacting groups. An iterative approach is taken to resolve the total pKa values in these cases. Table S.2 in the Supporting Information lists the interaction type (normal or iterative) for each possible interaction.
2.3. Protonation Scheme. A new generic protonation scheme has been implemented. The protonation scheme involves four steps. (i) Formal charges are set. For protein atoms, ARG-NH1, HIS-ND1, LYS-NZ, and the N-terminus are given a positive charge. For ASP-OD2, GLU-OE2, and the C-terminus, a negative charge is given. For heterogeneous atoms, charges are assigned on the basis of Sybyl atom types. Atoms assigned the Sybyl types N.pl3, N.3, N.4, and N.ar are given a positive charge, and one of the atoms in carboxyl groups (both oxygen atoms are assigned the Sybyl type O.co2) is given a negative charge. These charges are only used internally in the protonation algorithm and not in the pKa calculation. (ii) The number of protons that should be added to each atom is set on the basis of the number of valence electrons, the number of bonds, the number of π-electrons in double and triple bonds, and the formal charge. (iii) The steric number and number of lone pairs are set for each atom. (iv) Protons are added on the basis of the assigned steric numbers using either trigonal or tetrahedral geometrical considerations. Only ligand molecules and protein groups included in the pKa calculation are protonated by default.
2.4. Coupling Effects. Two types of coupling effects, covalent and noncovalent, are modeled in PROPKA3.1. The coupling effects are described in the following subsections and demonstrated using specific examples on structures including HIV protease, ATP, and a pyrazine derivative in the Results and Discussion.
2.4.1. Noncovalent Coupling. Titratable groups that are proximate in the protein 3D structure can titrate in a coupled fashion. This phenomenon can manifest itself in macroscopic titration curves that do not conform to the standard HendersonÀ Hasselbalch shape. Microscopically, the titration of two noncovalently coupled acidic groups can occur with either of the two groups titrating first and the other group titrating at an elevated pH value. PROPKA3.1 identifies noncovalently coupled groups and models their titrational behavior. For a pair of noncovalently coupled titratable groups, PROPKA3.1 models both orders of titration by assigning the shift in pKa value due to the interaction between the groups to either of the two groups.
The criteria listed in Table 4 must all be fulﬁlled before two groups are treated as being noncovalently coupled in PROPKA3.1. The diﬀerence of the intrinsic pKa values of the two groups, ΔpKain,mt ax, must not be higher than 2.0 pKa units to ensure

that the groups titrate at similar pH values. The intrinsic pKa is deﬁned as the theoretical pKa value a titratable group would have in the protein environment if no electrostatic interactions with other titratable groups were present.18 The interaction energy, Emin, between the two interacting groups must correspond to at least 0.5 pKa units, and the diﬀerence in free energy between the two possible protonation states, ΔGmax, must not be greater than 1.0 pKa units. The shift in pKa value when swapping to the alternative protonation state, ΔpKa,min, must be greater than 1.0 pKa unit. Only titratable groups with pKa values between 0.0 and 10.0 are considered.
2.4.2. Covalent Coupling. We define the covalent coupling effect as the titration of one group that is significantly influencing the probability of titration of another group proximate in the chemical structure. Two examples of such systems of covalently coupled groups are given in Figure 2. It is the interactions with the environment that determines which of the groups in a covalently coupled system of groups that will titrate. We model covalent coupling effects with a simple scheme that hinders the titration of groups for which titration has been rendered unlikely by a covalently coupled group. The groups for which titration has been penalized are restricted to the neutral form.
Ligand titratable groups are as default assumed to be covalently coupled if they are separated by no more than three chemical bonds and assigned the same Sybyl atom type. However, the user is free to deﬁne systems of covalently coupled titratable groups.
An initial pKa calculation is done including all groups in the molecular structure. Next, for each system of covalently coupled groups, the groups that are to be penalized are found. For bases, the group with the highest predicted pKa (the most stable group in the charged form) will be the ﬁrst one to adopt a proton as pH

is lowered, and this group is allowed to titrate. The remaining groups in the system are penalized so that they are restricted to the neutral form and not allowed to titrate. For acids, the group with the highest pKa value (the least stable group in the charged form) will be the last group to lose the proton as pH is raised and will be penalized so that it is restricted to the neutral form and not allowed to titrate. The remaining groups in the system are allowed to titrate. Finally, a new pKa calculation is performed disregarding the penalized groups in each covalently coupled system.
In some cases where the charge is distributed between more than one titratable atom (see the below example of aminochloro-pyrazine in complex with cell division protein kinase 2), a common charge center can be set. The common charge center, rccc, is deﬁned as the average of the positions of the covalently coupled groups:

∑n
rccc ¼ nÀ1 ri

ð7Þ

where n in the number of covalently coupled groups in the

system, and ri is the position of group i. 2.5. Prediction of Ligand Model pKa Values. For the
calculations of protonation state change on proteinÀligand

binding, experimental and previously calculated ligand model pKa values were used.5 The Schr€odinger program Epik,20 which is part of the Schr€odinger Software Suite, was used for the

prediction of ligand model pKa values for the covalently coupling examples presented in the Results and Discussion.

2.6. Calculation of Protonation State Changes. The overall

protonation change, n, is calculated as described in ref 5:

where N is a set containing all titratable groups in the system, and pKac,i and pKaf ,i represent pKa values of titratable group i in the complexed and free forms of the protein and the ligand molecule, respectively.
2.7. Protein Structures. A list of the structures from the Protein Data Bank21 used in this study is presented in the Supporting Information in Table S.3.
In the plasmepsin II (PDB id: 1pfz and 1sme) and cathepsin D (1lyw and 1lyb) structures, the N-terminus undergoes a large displacement between the apo and holo structures. This movement can be attributed to the autocatalytic behavior of aspartic acids. To limit the eﬀect of the N-terminus movement on the calculation results, we adopt the procedure of Alexov22 and remove the N-terminus section from these structures. Furthermore, a ﬂap region (residues 76À80) in the plasmepsin II holo structure was not resolved, and the corresponding region in the apo structure (1sme) was removed. All structures where repaired using the corall method of WHAT IF.23
Reduced cysteine bridges were manually reconstructed in the PROPKA3.1 input ﬁles for the complexes trypsinÀ1bMe (Cys173ÀCys197 and Cys25ÀCys41) and trypsinÀ1c (Cys173À Cys197). Ligand model pKa values were set in accordance with experimentally determined values.24

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the following sections, we will demonstrate the implemented covalent and noncovalent coupling algorithms with pKa calculations on HIV protease, a pyrazine derivative, and ATP.

3.1. Noncovalent Coupling: HIV Protease. PROPKA3.1 detects the catalytic active aspartic acids in HIV protease at position 25 in chains A and B to be noncovalently coupled. Figure 3 is a representation of HIV protease in complex with the KNI-272 inhibitor (1hpx) where the side-chain interactions predicted by PROPKA are represented as dotted lines. PROPKA predicts Asp25A to have side-chain interactions with Asp25B and the two oxygen atoms (O2 and O4) in the allophenylnorstatine fragment of the inhibitor. These side-chain interactions contribute with À0.85 (O2), À0.85 (O4), and À0.84 (Asp25B) pKa units to the total pKa value of Asp25A. For the pKa value of Asp25B, O2 contributes À0.85 pKa units, whereas Asp25A contributes with þ0.84 pKa units. This gives rise to the total pKa values of 5.07 (Asp25A) and 9.28 (Asp25B). However, the two aspartic residues are identified as being coupled, indicating the existence of an alternative protonation state. If the contributions to the pKa values due to the interactions between the aspartic acids are swapped, the alternative total pKa values of 8.64 (Asp25A) and 5.70 (Asp25B) are found.
Experimental results show that the pKa value of one of the catalytic active aspartic acids is 6.6 when in complex with KNI272.27 As the dyad is found to be monoprotonated, the experimental value should be compared to the highest of the predicted pKa values. While these values (9.28 or 8.64) are somewhat higher than the experimental value, the PROPKA2.0 value of 10.28 has a greater discrepancy. The pKa calculation on HIV protease complexed with KNI-272 is discussed in more detail later.
3.2. Covalent Coupling: Aromatic Nitrogen Atoms in a Pyrazine Derivative. For some chemical compounds, the titration of individual titratable sites is far from independent. Pyrazine rings, for example, contain two potentially titratable nitrogen atoms. However, once one of the nitrogen atoms has adopted a hydrogen atom, the probability of the other nitrogen atom adopting a hydrogen atom is significantly reduced. For the pyrazine

Three calculations on the complex between CDK2 and amino-
chloro-pyrazine have been done; see Table 5. In calculation A,
the PROPKA default ligand model pKa value of 5.00 for aromatic nitrogen atoms is applied. In calculation B, custom ligand model pKa values of 2.09 (N4) and À0.43 (N8) calculated with Schr€odinger’s Epik program were utilized. Finally, in calculation
C, the custom Epik ligand model pKa values utilized and electrostatic interactions were calculated using the common
charge center approach; see Materials and Methods. For both aromatic nitrogen atoms, the predicted pKa value is signiﬁcantly lowered due to large desolvation contributions (À2.51 pKa units for N8 and À3.41 pKa units for N4 in calculations A and B, and À2.84 pKa units for both nitrogen atoms in calculation C). A protonation of the N8 nitrogen would result in unfavorable
interactions with the proximate Lys33; see Figure 5. The lysine
residue therefore contributes with a side-chain interaction contribution of À0.36 pKa units in all calculations and a Coulombic interaction contribution of À1.56 pKa units (calculations A and B) or À0.99 pKa units (calculation C) to the predicted pKa value of N8. The pKa value of N4 is, on the other hand, increased due to interactions with the backbone carbonyl of Glu81 (0.24 pKa units) and Leu83 (0.86 pKa units). Hence, in all three calculations, N8 has the lowest pKa value and is excluded from the ﬁnal calculation.
PROPKA2.0 applied to the same structure wrongly predicts
that both aromatic nitrogen atoms titrate at similar pH values.
The pKa values are predicted to be 0.99 (N4) and 0.76 (N8). 3.2.1. ATP. A more complicated example is adenosine-50-
triphosphate (ATP), which with its three phosphate groups
urges for careful considerations during the setup of a PROPKA
calculation. Each of the phosphate groups contain two or three
oxygen atoms that could potentially adopt a proton. However,
only four of the total of seven phosphate oxygen atoms can titrate
as the remaining three phosphate oxygen atoms have double
bonds to a phosphorus atom. The challenge is therefore to
determine which of the phosphate oxygen atoms should be
allowed to titrate.
The new algorithm for treatment of covalently coupled
titratable groups allows the users to let PROPKA3.1 make this
decision. The oxygen atoms in each phosphate group are set up
to be covalently coupled as shown in the left panel in Figure 6.
The ability of titration is hence removed for one oxygen atom in
each of the phosphate groups.
Applying this approach to ATP complexed with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (1aq2,30 Figure 6, right panel)

identiﬁes the double-bonded, nontitratable phosphate oxygen atoms as O3G with the potential pKa value À11.66 (as compared to O1G, À12.92 and O2G, À12.82), O2B with pKa value À4.30 (as compared to O1B, À5.31), and O1A with pKa value 1.69 (as compared to O2A, 0.57); confer the left panel of Figure 6.
The potential pKa values for the oxygen atoms that are restricted to the neutral state are consistently around one pKa unit higher than the pKa values of the oxygen atoms that are found to titrate. This diﬀerence in pKa value is relatively small, and the choice of nontitratable oxygen atoms can seem some-
what ambiguous. We do, however, not consider this ambiguity important. Instead, it is important to note that PROPKA automatically has assigned the double bonds to the oxygen atoms for which it is predicted to be most energetically favorable for the
entire system. Additionally, the ambiguity stemming from a userdeﬁned setup of the ATP molecule is removed.
3.3. Protonation State Changes on Complexation. The following sections describe the results using PROPKA3.1 on calculations originally done with PROPKA2.0. For more in-depth
information on the experimental results, etc., please consult ref 5. 3.3.1. Trypsin and Thrombin. Table 6 contains the results for
calculations of protonation state changes done on serine protease
trypsin complexed with a set of related inhibitors derived from NR-(2-naphthylsulphonyl)-L-3-amidino-phenylalanine and thrombin complexed with four inhibitors. Klebe and co-workers24,31 have measured protonation state changes and calculated pKa changes using the PEOE_PB scheme for these complexes. Also included for comparison are the calculations originally done with PROPKA2.0.
For the binding of the ligand 1b to trypsin, an overall protonation state change of 0.66 was calculated in accordance with the experimental value of 0.90. This is an improvement as
compared to the calculated value by PROPKA2.0 of 0.09. The majority of the overall calculated protonation state change has its origin in a pKa shift of His57 from 7.47 in the apo form to 9.35 in the holo form. The shift in pKa value stems from interactions between the ligand carboxyl group and His57. While the increased desolvation contribution gives rise to a negative contribution to the pKa shift of His57 (À2.69 in the holo form as compared to À1.82 in the apo form), the desolvation contribution also activates the COO-HIS exception (confer Materials and Methods) for both Asp102 and the ligand carboxyl giving
a contribution of 1.60 for each carboxyl group. For trypsin complexed with the ligands 1bMe, 1c, and 1cMe, negligible overall protonation state changes were predicted in accordance

with experimental results. For the ligand 1d, the calculated value of À0.54 corresponds very well to the experimental value of À0.53. Similarly, the calculated values for trypsinÀ2 (0.71) and thrombinÀ2 (0.61) correspond well with the experimental values of 0.93 and 0.88, respectively. For thrombinÀ2, a clear improvement to the value calculated using PROPKA2.0 of 0.34 is observed.
In summary, an improvement in the predictions of PROPKA3.1 as compared to the predictions of PROPKA2.0 was observed for trypsinÀ1b and thrombinÀ2. The remaining results were similar to those obtained with PROPKA2.0. The overall rms deviations between experimental protonation state changes on complexation and calculated values were 0.18 for PROPKA3.1 and 0.29 for PROPKA2.0.
3.3.2. Proteins Complexed with Pepstatin. The protonation state change on ligand binding for three proteins (plasmepsin II, cathepsin, and endiothiapepsin) complexed with pepstatin is calculated and compared to experimental data and PROPKA2.0 results, cf., Table 7.
For plasmepsin II (1pfz) complexed with pepstatin (1sme), PROPKA3.1 predicts the overall protonation state change on ligand binding to be 2.67. This value is higher than the PROPKA2.0 value of 1.50 but still in accord with the experimental value of 1.7. The main predicted contributions to the overall protonation state change stem from Asp303 (1.00), Asp214 (0.99), and His318 (0.54). While the pKa shifts of Asp303 and Asp12 can be attributed to increased desolvation on ligand binding and to conformational changes, the pKa shift of His318, which is distant from the active site, stems from an interaction with Asp190 found in the holo structure but not in the apo structure. His164 was found to give a small contribution (À0.20) in the opposite direction of what would be expected from the experimental pKa values.

Figure 7 shows predicted protonation state changes for the complexation of plasmepsin II with pepstatin at various pH values. While the prediction has a clear discrepancy with the experimental values, it is comparable to previously calculated results.5,22
For cathepsin (1lyw) complexed with pepstatin (1lyb), the overall protonation state change is predicted to be 2.39, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 2.9 and very close to the PROPKA2.0 value of 2.49. The main contributions stem from Asp323 (0.92) and His56 (0.68). The pKa shift of Asp323 is caused by an increased desolvation due to the binding of pepstatin, whereas the pKa shift of His56 is due to conformational changes more distant from the active site.
For endiothiapepsin (4ape) complexed with pepstatin (4er2), only a small protonation state change is predicted (0.08), whereas the PROPKA2.0 value is 0.77 and the experimental value is 1.06. The original PROPKA2.0 calculation found the pKa value of Asp30 to be shifted from 6.69 to 7.21 (corresponding to a protonation state change of 0.29) and the pKa value of Asp12 to be shifted from 5.55 to 9.26 (corresponding to a protonation state change of 0.96) during complexation at pH 7.0. These shifts were mainly due to desolvation eﬀects and not reproduced in PROPKA3.1, which has an improved desolvation model.
To summarize, the main result of this subsection is that the overall protonation state values predicted by PROPKA3.1 are similar to the PROPKA2.0 values for cathepsin, but worse for plasmepsin II and endiothiapepsin.
3.3.3. HIV Protease. For HIV protease complexed with pepstatin (5hvp), the pKa values of the catalytic dyad consisting of Asp25A and Asp25B are predicted to be 10.16 and 5.73, respectively. This is partly in accord with experimental findings where one of the aspartic acids has a pKa value less than 2.5 and the other has a pKa value greater than 6.5 as measured with

values of Asp25A and Asp25B are predicted to be 4.78 and 9.56, respectively. Utilization of two alternative structures (1hhp and 3hvp) to describe the apo structure lowers the higher pKa value in the catalytic dyad, making the pKa shift on pepstatin binding larger.

Figure 7. Protonation state change as a function of pH for complexation of plasmepsin II with pepstatin. Predictions were done solely on the basis of the plasmepsin IIÀpepstatin complex structure (1sme) as well as in combination with the plasmepsin II apo structure (1pfz).

Figure 8. Protonation state change for HIV protease on complexation with the inhibitor KNI-272 as a function of pH. The predictions were done solely on the basis of the structure of the HIV proteaseÀKNI-272 complex (1hpx) as well as in combination with HIV protease apo structures (1hhp and 3hvp).

For HIV-1 protease complexed with the inhibitor KNI-272 (1hpx), experimental results show that the pKa value of one of the catalytic active aspartic acids changes from 6.0 in the apo form to 6.6 when in complex with KNI-272.27 As the dyad is found to be monoprotonated both before and after complexation, we must compare these experimental values to the highest of the predicted pKa values for the dyad, which are 8.89 (apo) and 9.28 (holo). While these predictions are higher than the experimental value, they are an improvement as compared to the PROPKA2.0 values of 9.26 (apo) and 10.28 (holo). The catalytic dyad is predicted to be noncovalently coupled; see Noncovalently Coupling: HIV Protease. The pKa value of the isoquinoline nitrogen on KNI-272 has been observed to shift from 4.8 to 2.9 during complexation. Using the experimental model pKa value of 4.8, PROPKA3.1 predicts the pKa value after complexation to be 4.40. This is comparable to the PROPKA2.0 value of 4.52.
The overall protonation state change was predicted to be 0.01, 0.04, and À0.24 when the apo structure was represented by 1hpx (KNI-272 removed), 1hhp, and 3hvp, respectively. These values agree well with the experimental value of À0.23. For comparison, the values predicted with PROPKA2.0 were 0.18, 1.27, and 0.97, respectively.
Experimental protonation state changes as a function of pH for HIV protease complexed with the inhibitor KNI-272 are presented in Figure 8 along with calculated values. It is seen that calculations done with 1hpx representing the apo form underestimate the protonation state changes due to pepstatin binding, whereas better accordance with experimental results is achieved for calculations where the apo form is represented by the structure with the PDB id 3hvp.
For HIV protease complexed with DMP-323 (1qbs), the pKa values of the catalytic dyad are predicted to be 5.88 and 8.52. This is in accord with the experimental result that the dyad has a pKa value of 8.19.49 While the experimental ﬁnding that both aspartic acids have a pKa value above 7.2 is not reproduced, there is a better agreement than for the PROPKA2.0 values of 3.26 and 8.56.
In summary, a better agreement with the experimental overall protonation state change for the complexation of HIV protease with KNI-272 was achieved with PROPKA3.1 as compared to the previously reported PROPKA2.0 values. Furthermore, an

improvement in the predicted pKa values of the catalytic dyad was observed for HIV protease complexed with KNI-272 and DMP-323.
3.3.4. Ligands Covalently Bound to the Protein Receptor. We have applied PROPKA3.1 to chymotrypsin covalently bound,
via its Ser195 residue, to two peptidyl trifluoromethyl ketone derived inhibitors. The oxygen in the ligand hemiketal adduct, formed during complexation from the ligand ketone and the
serine hydroxyl, is negatively charged. For chymotrypsin, His57 undergoes a shift from 7.54 (chain F)/7.48 (chain I) to 9.46 (chain F)/9.41 (chain I) during complexation with the NAcÀ PheÀCF3 inhibitor (6gch). This is in accordance with the experimental shift from 7.5 to 10.8. For the NAcÀLeuÀ PheÀCF3 inhibitor, the shift is predicted to be smaller (7.33/ 7.33 to 8.07/8.07 for chains F/I) in contrast to the experimental shift (7.5 to 12.0) but in agreement with the PROPKA2.0 shift (6.94 to 8.90).
For the covalent complexation of xylanase (1bvv) via its Glu78 with 2-deoxy-2-ﬂuoro-β-xylobioside (2FXb), a pKa shift of Glu172 from 7.52 to 6.80 was predicted. While smaller than the experimental shift (6.7 to 4.2), it is in agreement with the
PROPKA2.0 shift (7.45 to 6.64). Using the xylanase Asn35Asp mutant structure (1c5i), the pKa shift of the Asp35/Glu172 dyad is predicted to be from 5.58/11.45 to 10.83/5.70. The Asp35/
Glu172 dyad is correctly detected as being noncovalently coupled.
3.3.5. Ligands Containing Thiol Groups. The pKa value of His235 of hydroxynitrile lyase has been found to shift from 2.5 to ∼8 during binding of thiocyanate.50 The PROPKA3.1 predictions of the pKa value of His235 of 8.30 (holo form) and 6.72 (apo form) capture the direction of the shift and the experimental
pKa value in the holo form; however, the pKa of the apo form is significantly higher than the experimental value. The nitrile group elevates the pKa value of His235 by 0.41 pKa units due to an intrinsic electrostatic interaction, and the thiol group elevates the pKa value of His235 by 0.26 pKa unit (intrinsic electrostatic interaction) and 1.05 pKa units (Coulombic interaction).
3.3.6. Dihydrofolate Reductase. We apply PROPKA3.1 to dihydrofolate reductase complexed with methotrexate. NMR experiments have shown that that the aromatic N1 nitrogen of

methotrexate is protonated in the complex up to pH values in excess of 10.51À54 In the complex, the N1 nitrogen forms a salt bridge with the deprotonated aspartic acid Asp27. PROPKA3.1 predicts the pKa value of Asp27 to be 5.82 (experimental value 6.6) in the apo form and À0.76 in holo form. The pKa value of the N1 nitrogen is predicted to shift from 5.7 to 5.97 during complexation. PROPKA3.1 does therefore not capture a large shift observed experimentally. PROPKA2.0 predicted the pKa value of the N1 nitrogen in the holo form to be 6.89. Setting the model pKa value of the N1 nitrogen to a calculated value of 4.4 does not significantly change the predicted shift in pKa value.
4. CONCLUSION
In the preparation of PROPKA3.1, we have focused on improving the treatment of ligand molecules and coupling eﬀects. It is our hope that the improvements will assist users in PROPKA calculations on complicated systems. The implemented algorithm for noncovalent coupling will automatically detect coupled groups and notify the user of the existence of alternative pKa values. The implemented algorithm for covalent coupling improves the PROPKA treatment of complicated ligand molecules where titrational events are strongly linked. Furthermore, the algorithm will remove some of the ambiguity that arises when users manually set up complicated molecules for PROPKA calculations.
We have tested new implementations on a set of ligandcontaining structures also used for the preparation of PROPKA2.0. Except for a few cases, the new algorithms in PROPKA3.1 were found to yield results similar to or better than those obtained with PROPKA2.0. With the improved treatment of complicated ligand molecules, pKa calculation on structures containing DNA is now within reach, and this will be the goal of our continued eﬀorts.
