ABSTRACT Calcium-dependent gating of the large-conductance Ca21-activated K1 (BKCa) channel is conferred by the large cytosolic carboxyl terminus containing two domains of the regulator of K1 conductance (RCK) and the high-afﬁnity Ca21binding site (the Ca21-bowl). In our previous study, we located the putative second RCK domain (RCK2) and demonstrated that it interacts directly with RCK1 via a hydrophobic ‘‘assembly interface’’. In this study, we tested the structural model of the other interface, the ‘‘ﬂexible interface’’, by strategically positioning charge pairs across the putative interface. Several charge mutations on RCK2 affected the voltage-dependent activation of the channel. In particular, the Gly-to-Asp substitution at position 803 profoundly affected channel activation by stabilizing the open conformation of the channel with minimal effects on its Ca21 afﬁnity and voltage sensitivity. Various mutations at Gly-803 shifted the channel’s conductance-voltage curve either left or right over a 145-mV range. Since this residue is predicted to be in the ﬁrst loop of RCK2 these results strongly suggest that this loop plays a critical role in determining the intrinsic equilibrium constant for channel opening, and they support the hypothesis that this loop is part of an interface that mediates conformational coupling between RCK1 and RCK2.

INTRODUCTION
Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels play an important role in modulating a number of physiological processes, such as neuronal excitability, smoothmuscle contraction, frequency tuning of hair cells, and immunity (1–8). The opening of these channels is promoted by membrane depolarization and elevated cytosolic free calcium via separate regions of the a-subunit (Slowpoke or Slo) (9–12). The positive charges on transmembrane domains (S1–S4) are responsible for voltage sensing (13–19), whereas the calcium-dependent activation of the channel is mediated by the bulky cytoplasmic carboxy terminus (20–22). The cytoplasmic C-terminus of Slo has been proposed to contain a high-afﬁnity Ca21-binding site (Ca21-bowl) and a structural module known as the regulator of K1 conductance (RCK) domain (21,23–28). The Ca21-bowl is composed of a series of Asp residues and binds Ca21 with micromolar afﬁnity. Mutations here have been shown to cause positive shifts in the Slo channel’s conductance-voltage relationship at constant Ca21 concentrations (21,22,25,26,29,30). Recognized initially in a Ca21-activated K1 channel of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (MthK), a double ring composed of eight RCK domains (gating ring) has been studied intensively as a model for Ca21-dependent channel gating (31). Based on sequence homology and supporting experimental evidence, two RCK domains have been

proposed to lie in tandem within the long C-terminus of the mammalian BKCa channel (23,32–34). The ﬁrst RCK domain (RCK1), located at the proximal C-terminus of the Slo protein, has been characterized in detail using mutational analysis. RCK1 contains two divalent-cation-binding sites with high and low afﬁnity for Ca21, respectively (26–28). A gain-of-function mutation that causes epileptic seizures has also been localized to RCK1 (35). In the exogenously expressed mutant channel, the calcium sensitivity was found to increase by three- to ﬁvefold over the wild-type and the conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship was shifted toward more negative potentials by 57 mV. The second RCK domain (putative RCK2), which is essential for Ca21-dependent gating of the channel, is located in the distal region of the C-terminus and is immediately followed by the Ca21-bowl. Recently, we reported that hydrophobic interactions between RCK1 and the putative RCK2 are essential for the gating of the channel. This interaction is reminiscent of the ﬁxed (assembly) interface between the two RCK domains within the gating ring of MthK (23). It was also suggested that the dimeric pairs of RCK domains on a single subunit are responsible for cooperative activation of BKCa channels by calcium (36).
In a search for important amino acid residues for channel activation in the putative RCK2, we mutagenized several residues located in the region corresponding to the ﬂexible interface as revealed in the crystal structure of the MthK gating ring. Among the mutant channel, an Asp substitution at Gly-803 greatly enhanced channel activity as evidenced by as much as an 80-mV shift in the G-V curve toward a more negative potential. This potentiation can be explained by a stabilization of the open conformation that neither leads

to a change in Ca21 afﬁnity nor a change in voltage sensitivity. The residue is predicted to be located at the interface between RCK1 and the putative RCK2, suggesting that the region of the putative RCK2 that interfaces with RCK1 is important for determining the energetics of the conformational changes that lead to channel opening. This region may mediate the conformational coupling between downstream Ca21 binding at the Ca21-bowl and the upstream RCK1 and transmembrane domains.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expression of Slo channels in Chinese hamster ovary cells
All electrophysiological experiments, except for the gating-current measurements, were performed on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells expressing the rat Slo channel gene (GenBank accession No. AF135265) (37). CHO-K1 cells were maintained in F-12K nutrient mixture, Kaighn’s modiﬁcation (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in a humidiﬁed atmosphere at 5% CO2 and 37°C. To obtain high-quality plasmid DNA for transient transfection, the plasmid DNA was prepared using a commercial kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Expression of Slo channels in Xenopus oocytes
To measure the gating current, wild-type and mutant rSlo channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We used complementary DNA for rSlo subcloned into a modiﬁed pGH expression vector for high-level expression. Complementary RNAs for the rSlo channel were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX) and plasmids were linearized with NotI. Approximately 150–200 ng of cRNA were injected into oocytes. The injected oocytes were incubated at 18°C for 4–8 days in ND96 solution.
Site-directed mutagenesis of the Slo channel
Silent mutations were introduced at amino acid positions 728, 729, and 1016 of rSlo (GenBank accession No. GI:4972782) using two sequential polymerase chain reactions to create AgeI (from ACTGGA to ACCGGT) and XhoI (from CTCGAA to CTCGAG) restriction sites. Cassette mutagenesis was performed to substitute speciﬁc amino acid residues. Mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction using mutagenic primers. The ampliﬁed DNA fragments ﬂanked by AgeI and XhoI were substituted for the wild-type rSlo gene cloned into the pcDNA3.1(1) vector using BamHI and XbaI restriction sites. To conﬁrm the DNA sequence of each mutant channel, DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI 377 automatic DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Foster City, CA).
Electrophysiological recordings and data analysis
Most of the macroscopic ionic currents carried by wild-type and mutant rSlo channels were recorded in excised membrane patches of CHO-K1 cells with inside-out conﬁgurations using an Axopatch 200B ampliﬁer (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). All patch recordings were performed at room temperature 24–48 h after transfection. Pipettes were prepared from thinwalled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and ﬁre-polished. Macroscopic currents of rSlo channels were activated by voltage pulses delivered from a holding potential of À100 mV to test potentials ranging from À150 to 200 mV in 10-mV increments. When ﬁlled with the solutions described below, the input resistances of electrodes for macroscopic currents were 2.5–3.5 MV, whereas for single-channel

447
recording they were .4.0 MV. Average series resistance, ;2.9 MV, was used to compensate electronically for the macroscopic recordings. Signals were ﬁltered at 1–2 kHz using a four-pole low-pass Bessel ﬁlter, digitized at a rate of 10 kHz using a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments), and stored in a personal computer. Commercial software packages such as Clampex 8.1 (Axon Instruments) and Origin 6.1 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) were used for the acquisition and analysis of macroscopic data.
Single-channel opening events were obtained from patches containing one to hundreds of channels. Recordings were obtained for durations of 20 to hundreds of seconds. Unitary currents were sampled at 200 kHz and ﬁltered at 10 kHz. Analysis was performed using the Clampﬁt program (Axon Instruments). In the limiting PO measurements, open probabilities ,10À3 were determined at 0 [Ca21] with patches that contained hundreds of channels. The number of channels in a given patch (N) was obtained from the instantaneous tail current amplitude during maximal opening at saturating [Ca21]i divided by the unitary conductance for each channel at the tail voltage.
For the gating-current measurements, patch pipettes were made of borosilicate glass (VWR, West Chester, PA) and their tips were coated with sticky wax (Sticky Wax, Dharma Trading, San Rafael, CA) and ﬁre-polished to a resistance of 0.5–1 MV. Voltage commands were ﬁltered at 7.5 kHz. Data were acquired at 100 kHz and ﬁltered at 10 kHz with an Axopatch 200B ampliﬁer and a Macintosh-based computer system equipped with an ITC-16 hardware interface (Instrutech, Port Washington, NY) and pulse-acquisition software (HEKA Electronik, Southboro, MA). Data analysis was performed with Igor Pro graphing and curve-ﬁtting software (WaveMetrics, Oswego, OR).
Solutions for macroscopic ionic-current recording were prepared according to Lim and Park (38). Pipette solutions contained 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM EGTA, 116 mM KOH, and 4 mM KCl. The intracellular solution for perfusing to the internal face of excised patches was the same as the pipette solution except for supplemental CaCl2. To provide the precise free concentration of intracellular Ca21 ([Ca21]i), the appropriate amount of total Ca21 to be added to the intracellular solution was calculated using the program MaxChelator (39). The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with 2-[Nmorpholino]ethanesulfonic acid. Gating-current recording solutions were prepared according to Bao and Cox (40). The composition of the pipette solution was 127 mM triethylammonium-OH, 125 mM HMeSO3, 2 mM HCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted with HMeSO3 or triethylammonium-OH). The internal solution contained 141 mM N-methylD-glucamine, 135 mM HMeSO3, 6 mM HCl, 20 mM HEPES, 40 mM (1)18-crown-6-tetracarboxylic acid (18C6TA), 5 mM EGTA, pH 7.2 (adjusted with NMDG and HMeSO3).
RESULTS
Functional effects of engineered charge pairs across the putative ﬂexible interface between RCK1 and RCK2
On the basis of the gating ring structure of MthK, we constructed a heterodimeric structural model of the Slo channel’s putative ﬂexible interface between RCK1 and RCK2 (Fig. 1 A, left). Although the ﬂexible interfaces of the homomeric RCK dimers in MthK are formed by two helices from each RCK domain’s N-terminal lobe (aF and aG), and also parts of their C-terminal lobes (23), our model of the Slo channel’s heterodimeric RCK dimer predicts that RCK1 interacts with RCK2 mainly through aF helices. This is because of the apparent absence of an aG helix and a C-terminal lobe in the putative RCK2. We surveyed the amino acid residues at the contact sites in our model between RCK1 and RCK2, and residues of the putative RCK2 that appeared to

be in close proximity to charged residues in RCK1 were identiﬁed (Fig. 1 A, right). We, then, substituted each interfacial residue of the putative RCK2 with a residue that had the counter charge of the one in RCK1 to create a charge pair across the interface.
The wild-type channel and each mutant were expressed in CHO-K1 cells, and their functional activities were investigated electrophysiologically. Fig. 1 B shows representative macroscopic currents from each channel type, evoked by a common voltage protocol in the presence of 2 mM [Ca21]i. As is evident, the mutations showed varied effects. In Fig. 1 C, the steady-state extent of activation of the four mutant channels is plotted as a function of voltage and these plots compared with wild-type. The G-V relations of the G803D and N806K mutants were strongly shifted toward more negative voltages, whereas the G-V relation of M934D was slightly shifted in a positive direction. Compared to the halfactivation voltage (V1/2) of the wild-type channel, 79 mV, the

V1/2 values of the G803D and N806K mutants were À3 mV and 34 mV, respectively (Fig. 1 D), which correspond to shifts of 82 and 45 mV in the negative direction. Despite the fact that the mutants’ G-V curves were spread across an ;90-mV range, the slope of each G-V curve representing the apparent voltage dependence of the channel activation was not altered signiﬁcantly. The apparent gating charges determined from the slope of each activation curve are as follows: for wild-type, 1.31e 6 0.07; for G803D, 1.38e 6 0.06; for N806K, 1.47e 6 0.04; for N912K, 1.41e 6 0.08; for M934D, 1.38e 6 0.06.
Ca21-independent parallel shifts of the G -V relation in G803D mutant channel
As we were intrigued by the dramatic G-V shift generated by the Gly-to-Asp mutation at position 803, we scrutinized the mutant channel for insights into the mechanism involved. As

shown in Fig. 2 A, the ionic currents of G803D were activated at more negative voltages and at lower concentrations of intracellular Ca21 than were those of the wild-type channel. The G-V relationships of the wild-type channel (open symbols) and the mutant (solid symbols) are plotted at 0.5 mM (rectangles), 2 mM (circles), and 20 mM (triangles) [Ca21]i in Fig. 2 B. At all three [Ca21]i the mutation negatively shifted the G-V curve by ;80 mV. We then quantiﬁed the effects of intracellular Ca21 on the position of the mutant’s G-V relationship by plotting V1/2 vs. [Ca21]i for [Ca21]i ranging from 0.5 to 20 mM. In the semilogarithmic plot shown in Fig. 2 C, the V1/2 values of both the wild-type and mutant channels were found to be linearly related to [Ca21]i; however, the G-to-D mutation shifted the V1/2 value of the each G-V curve by À78 mV at all [Ca21]i tested.
To address which aspects of Slo-channel gating were altered by the G-to-D substitution in the putative RCK2 domain, we simulated our experimental data based on the simple voltage-dependent version of the Monod-WymanChangeux (MWC) model previously proposed as a gating model for the BKCa channel (41). In this model, there are several simplifying assumptions. The channel is a homotetramer containing four Ca21-binding sites, one on each subunit. Ca21 can bind to both the open and closed conformations but it favors the open conformation, and thereby promotes the opening. The voltage sensors from each subunit move in a highly concerted way such that their movement can be represented by a single voltage-dependent conformational change. Four different parameters obtained from the simulation were compared between the wild-type and G803D (Table 1). Three parameters were not signiﬁcantly affected (i.e., the apparent gating charge (Q), and the afﬁnities for Ca21 in the closed state (KC) and the open state (KO)), however, the close-to-open equilibrium constant in the absence of bound Ca21 at 0 mV, L0, was altered dramatically from 8.6 3 10À4 to 0.021. The results of our simulation suggest that the substitution of Asp at position 803 alters the equilibrium constant for channel opening by 24-fold.

The potentiating effects of the G803D mutation were then examined at the single-channel level. Single-channel current traces of the wild-type channel and G803D were compared in the absence and presence of 2 mM [Ca21]i (Fig. 3 A). As predicted from our analysis of macroscopic currents, the mutant channel opened more frequently than did the wildtype channel, even in the absence of Ca21.

opening, G803D always displayed a higher open probability (see the expanded timescale in Fig. 3 A).
The open probabilities (PO) of the wild-type and the mutant channel were plotted against membrane voltage in Fig. 3 B. The PO of both channels increased as the membrane potential was set to more positive values. However, the wildtype channel was activated in the voltage range of 20–100 mV, whereas the G803D channel was activated at far lower voltages, between À80 and 40 mV. Thus, the mutation negatively shifts the rSlo channel’s PO versus voltage curve

by 88.6 mV (Fig. 3 B). This shift is similar to the G-V shift we observed with macroscopic current recordings, 82 mV (Fig. 2 B). Despite its large effects on gating, the mutation did not affect the single-channel conductance of the rSlo channel. When we plotted the current amplitudes obtained from all-point histograms at different membrane voltages, the unitary conductances of the wild-type channel and G803D mutant were determined to be 232 6 3 pS and 229 6 3 pS, respectively (Fig. 3 C).
Effects of G803D on the intrinsic gating equilibrium
Since the simulation of the macroscopic current recordings suggested a signiﬁcant shift in the intrinsic gating equilibrium of the G803D mutant channel, we directly determined the equilibrium constants for the intrinsic close-to-open conformational change for both channels by measuring open probability (PO) at hyperpolarized membrane potentials.

Mutational Modulation in BK Channel RCK2

According to the Horrigan et al. model (43–45), at extreme negative voltages, where no voltage sensors are active, PO ¼ L0exp(zLFV/RT), which can be rearranged to log (PO) ¼ 0.4342zLFV/RT 1 log(L0) (40,46), where L0 represents the equilibrium constant between closed and open at 0 mV in the absence of Ca21 when no voltage sensors are active, zL is a small amount of gating charge associated with the closed-to-
open conformational change, and F, R, and T have their usual
meanings. This equation can be interpreted to mean that, as
the membrane voltage becomes more and more hyper-
polarized, a plot of log(PO)-voltage will reach a limiting slope that is less than its maximum slope and reﬂects the
voltage dependence of just the close-open conformational
change, zL. That is, in this voltage range, the slope of the log(PO)-voltage relation will be determined only by zL, and the position of the curve in the vertical axis will be
determined only by L0. Thus, we can directly estimate zL and L0 by determining the PO versus voltage relation at far negative voltages. Here, it is important to note that the L0 value is deﬁned differently from the L0 simulated with the voltage-dependent MWC model (Table 1). Whereas the L0 parameter in the voltage-dependent MWC model represents
the equilibrium constant between open and closed at 0 mV in the absence of Ca21, the L0 value obtained from limiting

slope measurements represents the equilibrium constant between open and closed at 0 mV in the absence of Ca21 if no voltage sensors are active (42). Thus, the L0 parameter in the simple voltage-dependent MWC model includes L0 as deﬁned by Horrigan and Aldrich but also factors that depend on voltage sensor activation (43–45).
We measured PO for the wild-type channel and the G803D mutant over a wide range of voltages at 0 [Ca21]i and determined the effects of the mutation on intrinsic and voltage-dependent gating. For the wild-type channel, PO values between À150 and 160 mV were measured using single-channel recordings, and PO values between 170 and 1200 mV were obtained from macroscopic recordings. In the case of the G803D mutant, single-channel recordings were used for voltages between À150 and 120 mV and macroscopic recordings were used for voltages between 130 and 1200 mV. Examples of single-channel recordings are shown in Fig. 4 A. Notice at each voltage the G803D mutant opens more frequently than does the wild-type channel. In Fig. 4 B, log(PO)-voltage relations for the wild-type and mutant channels are compared. As the voltage becomes more negative, both plots deviate from linear. The wild-type curve deviates at around À30 mV, and reaches a limiting slope by À110 mV. By ﬁtting just the most negative part of this curve,

FIGURE 4 Estimation of L0 and zL from open probability (PO) at negative voltages. (A) Unitary currents were recorded at 0 Ca21 from the wild-type and G803D channels. Each patch contains 2,768 channels of wildtype and 2,664 channels of G803D channels. (B) Mean log(PO)-voltage relations are shown for the wild-type (h) and G803D (d) channel. Linear ﬁts of log (PO)-V relation at the ‘‘steep phase’’ (dashed line) indicate that the measurements either have reached or are approaching the limiting slope. The dashed line represents best ﬁts to the Boltzmann function. The solid line at the bottom of the data point was ﬁtted with the following function: log(PO) ¼ log(L0) 1 0.4342zLFV/RT. The resulting parameters were L0 ¼ 8.69 3 10À7 and zL ¼ 0.3e for the wild-type, and L0 ¼ 2.04 3 10À5 and zL ¼ 0.64e for G803D.
Biophysical Journal 94(2) 446–456

452
L0 and zL were calculated to be 8.69 3 10À7 and 0.3e, respectively. The slope of the mutant channel’s log(PO)voltage relation deviates from linear at around À70 mV and approaches a limiting slope near À140 mV. The values of L0 and zL for the mutant channel were by the same analysis determined to be 2.04 3 10À5 and 0.64e, respectively. Thus, this analysis suggests that the Gly-to-Asp mutation stabilized the open state of the channel by 23-fold, a number very similar to that which we obtained with voltage-dependent MWC modeling, 24-fold (Table 1). Thus, we can assume that most of the mutation’s effects on gating come from its effect on the intrinsic energetics of channel opening, rather than on Ca21 binding or voltage sensor movement.
Lack of mutational effects on the voltage sensor and voltage sensing
As a member of the voltage-gated ion-channel superfamily, the BKCa channel senses the membrane voltage by moving its voltage sensor within the S2–S4 segment of the a-subunit (19). Membrane depolarization drives the outward movement of the positively charged voltage sensor and evokes outward or ‘‘on-gating’’ currents, whereas membrane hyperpolarization generates inward or ‘‘off-gating’’ currents. To check whether the G803D mutation brings about any changes in other measurable gating parameters, we examined directly the effect of the mutation on voltage sensor movement by measuring gating currents from both wild-type and G803D channels. The ON- and OFF-gating currents of both channel types were measured at membrane voltages between À60 and 1320 mV with 1-ms voltage steps (Fig. 5 A). Gating charge displacement was determined by integrating the ON-gating current of each trace, and plots of charge displaced (Q) versus voltage are displayed in Fig. 5 B normalized to their maxima. As is evident the Q-V curves of the wild-type channel and the G803D mutant are superimposable, with half-activation voltages of 154 mV (wild-type) and 158 mV (G803D), and apparent gating charges per voltage senor of 0.52 (wild-type) and 0.50 (G803D). This result indicates that the G-to-D mutation in the putative RCK2 domain insigniﬁcantly affects voltage sensor movement in response

Kim et al.
to changes in voltage and therefore that the negative shift in the rSlo G-V (and PO-V) relationship caused G803D at all [Ca21]i is not due to changes in voltage sensing. Furthermore, combined with the data in Fig. 2 and, discussed above, it strongly suggests that G803D alters predominately, if not exclusively, the intrinsic equilibrium constant for channel opening.
Modulation of the rSlo G-V position by mutation at amino acid 803
To ﬁnd out how other amino acid residues at position 803 affect the gating properties of the Slo channel, we replaced Gly-803 with various amino acids. As expected all mutant channels evoked K1 currents in response to membrane depolarization or increases in intracellular Ca21, but there were large differences in expression level among the mutant channels (Fig. 6 A). Whereas some mutants, i.e., G803D and G803E, produced macroscopic currents comparable to wildtype, others, including G803P, evoked much smaller currents. Substitution of Gly-803 with hydrophobic residues, for example, G803F and G803L, did not generate enough K1 current for accurate and reproducible recordings. Moreover, different substitutions at G803 gave rise to markedly different effects on channel activation. In Fig. 6 B, the G-V relationships of the wild-type channel (open symbols) and several mutants (solid symbols) are compared. The effects of each mutation were quantiﬁed by examining V1/2 values (Fig. 6 C). The mutations could be categorized into four subgroups. Three polar amino acids (Thr, Ser, and His) had no effect. Three others (Ala, Cys, and Glu) produced small negative G-V shifts of ,40 mV. And three others (Pro, Asp, and Lys) produced large G-V shifts. The substitution of Gly-803 with Pro or Asp negatively shifted the Slo G-V relationship by 119.3 and 80.9 mV, respectively. In contrast, the substitution to Lys shifted the Slo G-V relation 30.0 mV in the positive direction. In all channels tested, the slopes of the G-V curves were not altered signiﬁcantly by the mutation. These results indicate that the voltage-dependent activation of the BKCa channel is highly sensitive to the residue at position 803, and that single substitutions at this position can modulate the

range of channel activation by as much as 147 mV without affecting the channel’s voltage sensitivity.
We wondered which aspect of the R-group is responsible for the perturbation of the gating equilibrium so sensitively. We tried to correlate the functional effects of the mutations with the biochemical and biophysical properties of the R-groups (47–49). The zV1/2 value of each mutant channel was plotted against the acid-ionization constant (pKa), polarity, hydrophobicity, and volume of the R-group (Fig. 7). pKa showed a statistically signiﬁcant positive correlation with the G-V shifts of the mutant channels (correlation coefﬁcient ¼ 0.7 (n ¼ 7)). The correlation coefﬁcients (r) for the other comparisons however (À0.345 for polarity (n ¼ 10), 0.316 for hydrophobicity (n ¼ 10), and À0.092 for volume (n ¼ 10)) did not indicate signiﬁcant correlation.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the functional importance of amino acid residues located in the putative second RCK (RCK2) domain of the BKCa channel’s a-subunit. We focused our attention on residues predicted by homology modeling to interact with RCK1 via the putative ‘‘ﬂexible interface’’. We did this to test for the presence of RCK2 and as well to perhaps gain experimental evidence in support of the arrangement of RCK1 and RCK2 in the homology model. Initially, we located four potential charge pairs across the interface and replaced the neutral residues on the putative RCK2 individually to either Lys or Asp, so that the mutated residues could interact electrostatically with countercharges on amino acids of RCK1. By examining the activation characteristics of the mutant channels, we initially found three mutations that altered the position of the G-V relation signiﬁcantly. It was intriguing to observe that the mutations

at different positions shifted the rSlo G-V relation in both the negative and positive directions, which suggests that they can stabilize either the open or the closed conformation. To examine whether mutations on the putative RCK2 domain alter the intrinsic equilibrium between open and closed, we performed further mechanistic studies on one such mutation, G803D.
This Gly residue (Gly-803 of rat Slo) is conserved, not only in the putative RCK2 of Slo homologs from Caenorhabditis elegans to human, but also in mammalian Slo paralogs such as Slick and Slo3 (Supplementary Fig. 1, highlighted in blue). Based on the known structure of the MthK RCK domain and our secondary-structure prediction, Gly-803 is predicted to be located within the ﬁrst loop between bA and aA of the N-terminal Rossmann-fold. The signiﬁcance of this position in the gating ring of octameric RCK domains may be considered from many points of view. Gly-803 is predicted to be close to the Ca21-binding sites of homologous RCK domains. When aligned with the amino acid sequence of RCK1, Gly-803 is only two residues away from one of the Asp residues (Asp-428 of rat Slo) known to affect the calcium sensitivity at low concentration of calcium (27) (Supplementary Fig. 1, highlighted in yellow). In addition, the sequence alignment also predicts that the ﬁrst loop of the MthK RCK domain, where Gly-803 is located in the putative RCK2, is physically close to the bound Ca21 with the closest distance of only 6.2 A˚ from polypeptide chain. (23). Since the relative movement of the ﬂexible interface has been shown to be the main conformational change induced by Ca21 binding in MthK (23), it is conceivable that the residues facing the ﬂexible interface would be sensitive to any mutation. Due to its positioning at this strategically critical region of the RCK heterodimer, the chemical nature of Gly-803 may determine the equilibrium

FIGURE 7 Correlation analysis of the zV1/2 values and biochemical and biophysical properties of the R-group at amino acid position 803. The zV1/2 values of each mutant channel were plotted against the pKa (A), polarity (B), hydrophobicity (C), and volume (D) of the R-group at position 803.

between the open and the closed conformations and thus determines the position of the G-V relationship of BKCa channel.
Based on the positive correlation between zV1/2 and pKa of R-group at position 803 (Fig. 7 A), some electrostatic inﬂuence at this position on the shift in the gating equilibrium can be expected. In fact, we probed the charge pair corresponding to mutagenized Asp at position 803 of the putative RCK2 and Lys-556 of RCK1 to understand the nature of the interaction. Using the Ala substitution at Lys-556 in the background of the G803D mutation, a double mutant cycle analysis gave a coupling energy of 3.0 kJ molÀ1 between Lys-556 of RCK1 and Asp-803 of RCK2 (data not shown). The magnitude of the coupling energy was rather weak, suggesting that the stabilization of the open conformation by the G803D mutation is more likely to be due to a weak through-space electrostatic attraction between the two residues rather than to a short-range salt bridge. It is also worth mentioning that no other countercharges other than Lys-556 were found in proximity to the amino acid position 803 in the structural model of the heterodimeric interface (Fig. 1 A). It is intriguing that Pro was such a stabilizing mutation for the open conformation and that it deviated the most from the correlation plots. It is conceivable that an amino-acid-like proline at this position adopts a local conformation that favors the open state. It remains to be seen whether the Glyto-Pro mutation will also cause a shift in the intrinsic gating equilibrium.

In summary, we identiﬁed amino acid residues on the putative RCK2 domain of the BKCa channel’s C-terminus that are important for channel activation. The most dramatic residue, Gly-803, modulated the channel’s G-V relationship over a wide range of transmembrane voltages by altering the intrinsic gating equilibrium. These results are consistent with the structural model proposed for the putative RCK2 domain in which this residue is located on the ﬂexible interface between RCK1 and RCK2. Thus, a conformational change in the gating ring, similar to that of bacterial Ca21-activated K1 channels, may underlie the Ca21-induced activation of the BKCa channel, and the putative RCK2 may be involved in the coupling between the Ca21-bowl and transmembrane domains via RCK1.
