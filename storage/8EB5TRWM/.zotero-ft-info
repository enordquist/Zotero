Title:          Quantifying the role of chaperones in protein translocation by computational modeling
Subject:        The molecular chaperone Hsp70 plays a central role in the import of cytoplasmic proteins into organelles, driving their translocation by binding them from the organellar interior.
Keywords:       translocation, Hsp70, chaperones, molecular dynamics, free energy
