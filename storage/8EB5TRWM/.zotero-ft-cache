The molecular chaperone Hsp70 plays a central role in the import of cytoplasmic
proteins into organelles, driving their translocation by binding them from the organellar
interior. Starting from the experimentally-determined structure of the E. coli Hsp70,
we computed, by means of molecular simulations, the effective free-energy proﬁle for
substrate translocation upon chaperone binding. We then used the resulting free energy
to quantitatively characterize the kinetics of the import process, whose comparison
with unassisted translocation highlights the essential role played by Hsp70 in importing
cytoplasmic proteins.
Keywords: translocation, Hsp70, chaperones, molecular dynamics, free energy
1. Introduction
Molecular chaperones are protein machines that assist other proteins in various cellular processes. 70-kDa Heat Shock Proteins (Hsp70s) are possibly the most versatile chaperones, supervising a wide variety of cellular tasks (Mayer and Bukau, 2005) that range from disaggregation of stable protein aggregates (Diamant et al., 2000) to driving post-translational import of cytoplasmic proteins into organelles (Matlack et al., 1999; Neupert and Brunner, 2002; Liu et al., 2014). Notably, Hsp70s play a fundamental role in the import of proteins into mitochondria because the majority of mitochondrial proteins are actually encoded in nuclear DNA, synthesized in the cytosol and only post-translationally imported into the organelles. Protein import takes place through a proteinaceous pore that spans the two mitochondrial membranes by way of the outer (TOM) and inner (TIM) membrane pore complexes (Neupert and Brunner, 2002). According to the current view, an ATP-consuming import motor located into the mitochondrial matrix drives the inward translocation of nuclear-encoded proteins. Mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70) is the central element of this motor: it is recruited by the TIM complex on the matrix side through interactions with the TIM44 protein, which is part of the pore, and with the pore-associated PAM16/18 proteins. The latter contain a J domain, whose role is to dramatically enhance the ATP-hydrolysis rate of Hsp70, thus increasing by orders of magnitude its aﬃnity for substrates. The ATP-driven binding of the chaperones to incoming proteins ultimately drives their translocation.
The structure of Hsp70 is highly conserved (Zuiderweg et al., 2013) and consists of two large domains connected by a small ﬂexible linker (see Figure 1). Speciﬁcally, the Nucleotide Binding Domain (NBD) is the ATPase unit of the chaperone, while the Substrate Binding Domain (SBD) directly interacts with speciﬁc sites on the incoming protein. These binding sites are frequently found in protein sequences, so that multiple chaperones are likely to bind the same substrate.
The precise mechanism by which Hsp70 exerts its pulling action has been debated in the literature and several models have been proposed (Glick, 1995; Neupert and Brunner, 2002; De Los Rios et al., 2006). The Brownian ratchet (Neupert and Brunner, 2002) assumes that, thanks to the

chaperone large size, Hsp70 binding prevents the retrotranslocation of the substrate into the pore, thus biasing the random ﬂuctuations toward the matrix. Alternatively, according to the power stroke (Glick, 1995) the chaperone actively pulls the incoming protein by using TIM as a fulcrum. Later, according to the entropic pulling model (De Los Rios et al., 2006), it was shown that an active force naturally emerges from a realistic physical description of the Brownian ratchet, thus reconciling the two views (Goloubinoﬀ and De Los Rios, 2007). Indeed, the excluded volume of the chaperone, besides preventing retrotranslocation, reduces the conformational space available to the incoming protein, thus decreasing its entropy. This reduction depends on the length of the imported fragment of the substrate, therefore resulting in a free-energy gradient which favors the import.
In the present work, we evaluate this thermodynamic force in an eﬀective one-dimensional space where the state of the system is represented by the number n of imported residues. In order to do so, for each value of n we compute the eﬀect of chaperone binding on the free energy of the system by means of coarsegrained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. This result is then used to devise a simpliﬁed yet quantitative analysis of the import, described as a one-dimensional diﬀusion process on the computed free-energy landscape.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Details of MD Simulations We coarse-grained both the substrate and the chaperone by considering one interaction site per residue centered on the Cα

atom. Residue-residue excluded-volume interactions were modeled with a repulsive Lennard-Jones potential with parameters σ = 3.8 Å and ε = 3kBT. The substrate was modeled by using the local ﬂexible potential introduced in Ghavami et al. (2013). Within this force ﬁeld, the elastic properties of a coarse-grained unfolded protein are described by means of harmonic Cα - Cα bonds and sequence-speciﬁc bending and torsional potentials. Particularly, the sequence dependence is introduced by considering a simpliﬁed three-letters description, where the eventual presence of glycine or proline amino acids is explicitly accounted for, while all the other residues are considered equivalent. In the present work, for simplicity we focus on glycine- and proline-free substrates, thus making use of the functions denoted as O-X-Y and X-X in Ghavami et al. (2013) for the bending and torsional contributions, respectively. The experimental structure of ADPbound Hsp70 (Bertelsen et al., 2009) (PDB: 2KHO) was used to model the chaperone. In particular, the NBD (residue 4–387) and SBD (residue 397–603) were treated as rigid bodies, while the ﬂexibility of the interdomain linker was accounted for by means of the potential described above. In order to reproduce a correct chaperone-substrate arrangement, we took advantage of the substrate-bound X-ray structure of DnaK SBD (PDB: 1DKX Zhu et al., 1996). MD simulations were performed using LAMMPS code (Plimpton, 1995) at constant temperature (T = 300 K) by means of a Langevin thermostat with damping parameter equal to 100 fs and using an integration timestep of 10 fs. For each value of n in the range 8 ≤ n ≤ 26 we performed a MD simulation of 5 · 1010 timesteps (examples of the convergence of the ratio Z70(n)/Z(n) are reported in the Figure S1—Supplementary Material), and the error on the free-energy proﬁle was estimated by block averaging (Frenkel and Smith, 2002).

2.2. Details of the Stochastic Simulations
The import process was simulated by means of a Monte Carlo
(MC) algorithm driven by the free-energy landscape Fimport, as determined from the sum of the chaperones pulling con-
tribution computed by means of the MD simulations and the
unfolding free energy Fu. The latter is modeled as a sigmoidal function

Fu(nin)=

,

where nin is the total number of imported residues, and Fumax and δn are tunable parameters representing the total free energy of unfolding and the cooperativity of the unfolding process, respectively (see Figure 4 top). For a system at position nin, a trial move was attempted to either nin + 1 or nin − 1 with equal probability and accepted according to the Metropolis criterion based on the free energy Fimport. To capture the sequence heterogeneity of the proteome, for each choice of Fumax and δn we generated 25 independent binding-site distributions, with the sole prescription that the average distance between consecutive binding sites was 35 residues as indicated by experiments (Rüdiger et al., 1997). For every distribution we performed 10 independent realizations of the import process. Average import times were estimated by counting the total number of MC timesteps needed

for the translocation process to be completed. This protocol is justiﬁed by the fact that MC simulations correspond to overdamped Langevin dynamics when only local moves are considered (van Kampen, 1992; Tiana et al., 2007). Rescaling the obtained import times by the acceptance rate, as proposed in Sanz and Marenduzzo (2010), did not aﬀect the results, because of the large fraction of accepted moves observed in all the simulations (> 95%).
3. Results
Protein import into organelles has been previously modeled as a one-dimensional stochastic process in the space of the imported residues (Elston, 2000, 2002; Liebermeister et al., 2001). In the present context, this protocol is justiﬁed by the timescale separation among substrate conformational dynamics, chaperone binding/unbinding and overall import. Indeed, the typical reconﬁguration time of an unfolded protein (∼ 100 ns Soranno et al., 2012) is extremely fast compared to the experimentallydetermined timescale for protein import into mitochondria (order of minutes Lim et al., 2001). Eﬀects arising from substrate conformational dynamics, such as the chaperone-induced entropy reduction, can be thus conveniently represented as eﬀective free-energy proﬁles inﬂuencing the import dynamics. Moreover, the import timescale is also signiﬁcantly slower than chaperone binding but faster than chaperone unbinding at physiological conditions. Indeed, according to the current understanding of the biochemical cycle of Hsp70 (Zuiderweg et al., 2013; De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014), ATP-bound chaperones associate with the substrate with a timescale equal to ∼ 10−2 s (as estimated from a Hsp70-peptide association rate equal to 4.5 × 105 M−1s−1 Schmid et al., 1994 and a chaperone concentration of 70 µM in mitochondria Liu et al., 2003), while dissociation takes place from the ADP-bound state, over timescales ∼ 103 s (Mayer et al., 2000). In the mitochondrial matrix chaperone-substrate dissociation is accelerated by the presence of nucleotide exchange factors, that catalyze the release of ADP and the ensuing rebinding of ATP. However, ATP hydrolysis is greatly enhanced in the proximity of the pore by poreassociated J-domain proteins, resulting into ultra-aﬃnity for the substrate (De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014) and thus into an immediate replacement of the dissociated chaperone. This suggests that, to our purposes, we can assume that a chaperone immediately and irreversibly binds each exposed binding site as soon as it is imported. As a consequence, for the present purposes the number n of substrate residues that have been imported into the mitochondrial matrix is a convenient coordinate to describe the system, whose dynamics can be modeled as a diﬀusion process on the corresponding free-energy landscape.
3.1. Free Energy Calculation The eﬀect of the size of the chaperone is two-fold. On the one hand, bound Hsp70 prevents the retrotranslocation of the substrate beyond its binding point (Brownian ratchet model Neupert and Brunner, 2002). On the other hand, the size of the chaperone leads also to a reduced number of sampled conformations

(entropic pulling De Los Rios et al., 2006), an eﬀect not accounted for by the Brownian ratchet as it was originally conceived, but nonetheless intimately related to the same physical mechanism. For example, in the absence of Hsp70 the two substrate conformations shown in the top panel of Figure 2 are both sterically allowed. However, upon chaperone binding the conformation on the right would result into an overlap between the membrane and Hsp70 (bottom panel in Figure 2), and it is therefore never sampled by the substrate when the chaperone is present. The free energy diﬀerence due to the loss of entropy is given by Fc(n)= −kBT log Z70(n)/Z(n) , where Z70(n) and Z(n) are the partition functions of the substrate with and without a bound chaperone, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature (when enthalpic contributions are not taken into account, the partition functions reduce to the number of sampled conformations, thus falling back to the original formulation of the entropic-pulling free energy De Los Rios et al., 2006). Here, we computed the free energy diﬀerence Fc(n) by estimating the ratio Z70(n)/Z(n) for n in 8 ≤ n ≤ 26 with multiple coarse-grained MD simulations. The substrate was modeled as a n-residues ﬂexible chain with the position of the nth residue constrained on the inner mithocondrial membrane, represented here as a ﬂat wall acting only on the substrate residues (see Materials and Methods for additional details). As a consequence, the system could sample conﬁgurations involving an overlap between the membrane and the chaperone (see bottom-right panel in Figure 2). With this strategy, we could estimate the ratio Z70(n)/Z(n) as the fraction of time spent by the system in physically-acceptable, i.e., non-overlapping, conﬁgurations. Particularly, we focused on n ≥ 8 in order to allow the exposure of a complete binding site. From the computed values of Z70(n)/Z(n), we could retrieve the free energy
Fc(n) as a function of n, as reported in Figure 3. As expected, shorter imported fragments resulted into a larger fraction of rejected conformations, i.e., larger values of Fc, thus leading to a free-energy gradient favoring the import of the protein. The slope of the entropic-pulling free-energy proﬁle corresponds to the thermodynamic pulling force exerted by a bound chaperone along n (Figure 3 inset). This force is in the piconewton range, starting from around 15 pN and decreasing as n increases. Remarkably, these results agree qualitatively with previous estimates based on strongly simpliﬁed representations of the system (De Los Rios et al., 2006), thus suggesting that comparable thermodynamic forces could be obtained by the same entropic pulling mechanism for macromolecules of similar size.
3.2. Stochastic Simulations of the Import Process We modeled the import of cytoplasmic proteins as a onedimensional stochastic process depending on the number nin of imported amino acids. The eﬀective free-energy proﬁle guiding the system evolution results from protein unfolding (Eilers and Schatz, 1986) and active chaperone pulling (Lim et al., 2001). Assuming a two-states folding behavior, a convenient choice to model the unfolding contribution to the free-energy landscape is a tunable sigmoidal function Fu(nin) (see Materials and Methods), depending on two parameters that measure the

The dashed blue line depicts the free-energy landscape predicted by the original Brownian ratchet, where the only effect of the chaperone is to prevent retrotranslocation beyond the binding site (inﬁnite wall). In the inset we report the thermodynamic force corresponding to the computed free-energy landscape.

total unfolding free energy (Fumax) and the cooperativity of the unfolding process (δn), with smaller values of δn corresponding to higher cooperativity (top panel in Figure 4). By tuning these parameters, the formula can account for the wide variety of imported proteins (Wilcox et al., 2005). The pulling action of the chaperone was modeled taking advantage of the freeenergy proﬁle determined from molecular simulations. Particularly, we assumed here that: (i) Hsp70s associate with each binding site as soon as it emerges from the pore, since they are targeted at the TIM pore exit by speciﬁc interactions (Neupert and Brunner, 2002); (ii) we considered only the contribution arising from the Hsp70 closest to the pore, taking into account the relatively fast decrease of the slope of Fc (see Figure 3) and the average frequency of binding sites (one every 35 amino acids Rüdiger et al., 1997). Therefore, we added to the unfolding free-energy Fu(nin) the chaperone contribution Fc(nin − nB), with nB corresponding to the position of the binding site closest to the pore, measured from the matrix terminus of the substrate.
As an example, in the bottom panel of Figure 4 we illustrate the evolution of the free-energy landscape during the import process of a protein with Fumax = 5kBT, δn = 100 and two binding sites at nB = 0 (i.e., at the matrix terminus) and nB = 28. At the beginning of the import process, no chaperone is bound to the substrate and the import free energy is simply given by Fimport(nin)= Fu(nin) (red dashed curve). As soon as the ﬁrst binding site is imported, a chaperone molecule binds the substrate and its contribution Fc is added to Fu(nin) starting from

the binding site nB = 0: Fimport(nin)= Fu(nin)+ Fc(nin) (purple continuous curve). Finally, after the second binding site
(nB = 28) is imported, another chaperone binds and the resulting free energy is Fimport(nin)= Fu(nin)+ Fc(nin − 28) (orange dot-dashed curve).
Following this approach, we computed the average import
time (see Materials and Methods) of 300-residue proteins for different values of δn and a range of Fumax corresponding to the stability of a large fraction of the proteome (Ghosh and Dill,
2010). In absence of Hsp70 assistance, the system must invari-
ably overcome a free-energy barrier, and the average import time τ0 increases exponentially with Fumax, independently of cooperativity (Figure 5 top). In all the considered cases, the average
import time for the chaperone-assisted process, τC, is sensibly smaller than τ0 (Figure 5 center). The chaperone pulling force reduces but does not completely eliminate the unfolding freeenergy diﬀerence for stable proteins (large Fumax), as in the case of the representative process shown in the bottom panel of Figure 4.
In this regime, the import is still an activated process, and the average times increase exponentially with Fumax. Conversely, the pulling action of Hsp70 dominates over the unfolding contribution for marginally stable proteins (small Fumax), thus resulting in values of τC comparable to what found for the extreme case Fumax = 0. The import kinetics is further modulated by δn, with high cooperativity (small δn) resulting in longer translocation
times.
In the bottom panel in Figure 5 we illustrate the chaperone-
induced kinetic advantage by reporting the ratio τ0/τC. This ratio ranges from a 10-fold gain for marginally stable proteins to 103 for extremely stable and non-cooperative substrates, with the majority of the proteome (Fumax ≥ 8kBT Ghosh and Dill, 2010) accelerated at least 100 times. If we take into
account that protein import into mithocondria has been mea-
sured to happen in the timescale of several minutes (Lim et al.,
2001), our model indicates that the translocation process in

the absence of chaperones would probably extend to hours or days. Since such a slow process would clearly be incompatible with the average lifespan of proteins and the duration of the cell cycle, our results provide a molecular basis to support the essential role of chaperones in the in vivo import process.

Hsp70 (τC) for the same cases as in the top panel. Bottom: Acceleration of the process due to the assistance of Hsp70, expressed as the ratio τ0/τC.

4. Conclusions
To summarize, in this work we derived a free-energy proﬁle for the import process based on a molecular description of Hsp70 that rationalizes the requirement for chaperone assistance in mitochondrial protein import observed in experiments. Naturally, a more precise quantitative estimation could be obtained by considering a more reﬁned representation of the system, i.e., going beyond the coarse-grained model at residue level resolution employed in this work and considering also other interactions than the excluded volume. The

present results can be applied to other cases of Hsp70-driven translocation, namely protein import into ER (Matlack et al., 1999) and chloroplasts (Liu et al., 2014). In the ER case, in particular, the pore is much simpler than in mitochondria, as it spans just a single membrane. The presence of Sec63, a pore-associated protein containing a J domain, ensures also in this context that the extended ATP-driven Hsp70 ultrafﬁnity prevails in the competition against other translocation counterproductive interactions (Scidmore et al., 1993). Moreover, this approach based on the combination of molecular

simulations and kinetic modeling can be easily extended to other Hsp70-mediated cell processes. In particular, this freeenergy picture could help to understand some recent results pointing toward a fundamental role of Hsp70 in preventing the stalling of translation at ribosomes (Liu et al., 2013; Shalgi et al., 2013). Owing to the universality of the interaction responsible for the eﬀects studied here, namely excluded volume, the same principles could apply to similar processes driven by other biomolecules.
