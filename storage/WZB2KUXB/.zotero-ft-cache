performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) in 8 M urea and found the urea-induced protein unfolding proceeded primarily not by active attack but by a favorable interaction of urea with transiently exposed, less-polar residues and the protein backbone, thereby impeding the hydrophobic collapse of partially unfolded proteins toward the native state. However, another MD simulation

of CI2 in 8 M urea showed that the
 ﬁ

also found water penetrated into the hydrophobic cores of protein HP-35 and its mutant ahead of urea, thus inducing the expansion of hydrophobic cores, which were then further solvated and stabilized through interactions with both  water and urea, especially urea. They proposed that urea changed the ac tiv ity of wa ter , thu s fac ili tat ing th e pen etr ati on of wa ter int o the hydrophobic cores of proteins. In combination with their previous work,
23
they postulated that this indirect e

found that urea -indu ced dena turat ion of prot eins was domi nantl y  driven by stronger dispersion interaction of urea with protein than water, and urea penetrated the hydrophobic core before  water, forming a

 ABSTRACT:
 In a previous study, we performed the molecular dyna mics (MD) simulat ions of vario us carb on nano tubes solvated in 8 M urea and observed a striking phenomenon of  urea-induced drying of hydrophobic nanotubes, which resulted from the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotube (Das, P.; Zhou, R. H.
 J. Phys. Chem. B
 2010
 ,
  114
 , 5427
-
5430). In this paper, we have compared
  ﬁ
 ve di
ﬀ 
erent urea models to investigate if the above phenomenon is sensitive to the urea models used. We demonstrate through MD simula- tio ns tha t the dry ing phe nom eno n andits ph ysi ca l mec ha nis m are qu ali tat ive ly ind epe nde nt of th e ure a mo del s. Co nsi ste nt wit h our previous study, our current analyses with both interaction potential energy and association free energy indicate that there is a
  “
dry  state
”
 inside the carbon nanotubes, which is caused by the urea
’
s preferential binding to nanotubes through stronger dispersion interactions. These results also have implications for understanding the urea-induced protein denaturation by providing further evidence of the potential existence of a
  “
dry globule
”
-like transient state during protein unfolding and the
  “
direct interaction mechanism
”
(whe reby urea atta cks prot ein direc tly, rat her than di srup ts wate r struc ture as a
“

”
). In addition, our study  high light s the cruc ial role of disp ersio n interac tion in the selec tive abso rptio n of molec ules in hydr opho bic nano pores and may have signi
ﬁ
cance for nanoscience and nanotechnology.

the prote in. Unf ort una tel y, th e tra ns ien t nat ureof theprop os ed dr y  globule and the complicated structure of the hydrophobic core of  protein make the further investigations very di
ﬃ
cult. In a previous study,
24
 by using MD simula tio ns, we have desig ned some mod el syst ems with the sing le-w alle d car bon nano tub es (SWN Ts) to investigate the urea-induced denaturation of proteins and found a striking phenomenon of urea-induced drying of the hydrophobic nano tub es. However , in tha t stud y, only the CHA RMM urea model
25
 was used , and it was uncl ear if the con clus ions will be sensitive to di
ﬀ 
erent force
 ﬁ
elds or more speci
ﬁ
cally di
ﬀ 
erent urea models. There are some other urea models, such as OPLS,
26,27
KBFF
28
(force
  ﬁ
eld derived form Kirkwood
-

 theory), and  AMBE R*
29
urea models. The charge distributions of these urea models are quite di
ﬀ 
erent (see Table 1), which result in di
ﬀ 
erent electrostatic interactions. Consequently, the simulation results may  di
ﬀ 
er from one another with di
ﬀ 
erent urea models. In this paper, we use
  ﬁ
 ve di
ﬀ 
erent urea models (see
  “
Model and Methods
”
 for de tai ls) to stu dy th e dep end enc e of the phenomenon of urea-induced drying of hydrophobic nanotubes on the ure a mod els . Sim ila r to ou r pre vio us stu dy, we als o use the SWNT as the prototype of the hydrophobic core of protein,  because the SWNT has a similar hydrophobic environment
23
and a comparable size (a few nanometers) to a protein interior.
30
There fore, even thou gh the chemica l stru cture of a carb on nanotube is not exactly the same as a protein interior, the simulation results from our model system would still be helpful to understand the mechanism of urea-induced denaturation of  proteins. In all of the
 ﬁ
 ve cases, we observe the drying phenom- enon for both the wide nanotube [(17, 8) SWNT] and the narrow nanotube [(6, 6) SWNT]. This strikingly drying phe- nomenon is attributed to the stronger dispersion interaction of  urea than water with nanotube. These results are consistent with our previous study.
24
Thus we co nclude th at the ph enomenon of  urea-induced drying of the hydrophobic nanotubes, together  with its physic al mechanism, are qua litatively independent of th e urea models. We also compare the drying e
ﬀ 
ects with di
ﬀ 
erent urea models. The present study implies the existence of a dry  globule-like transient state during the urea-induced denaturation of proteins and supports the
  “
direct interaction mechanism
”
 whereby urea has a stronger dispersion interaction with protein than water.
19
In addition, our study highlights the crucial role of  dispersion interaction in the selective absorption
31,32
of mole- cules in hydrophobic nanopore.
2. MODEL AND METHODS
To study the in
ﬂ
uence of urea models on the phenomenon of  urea- indu ced dryi ng of the hydr opho bic nanot ubes, we have used
ﬁ
 ve di
ﬀ 
ere nt ure a mod els : OP LS,
26,27
KBFF,
28
CHARMM (pa ram ete rs der ive d fro m the CHA RMM 22 for ce
  ﬁ
eld
25
),  AMBER*,
29
and AMBER [parameters derived from the
  ﬁ
le embedded in the AMBER 10 simulation package (University  of California at San Francisco)]. The OPLS and KBFF models are probably the most popular urea models,
7,8,15
-
18,20,23,33
-
37
and there are some previous studies on the comparison of these two models.
15,34
-
37
The CHARMM urea model is also widely  use d to stu dy the pro ces s and mec ha nis m of ure a-i ndu ced denaturation of proteins.
9,14,19,22,38
The AMBER* urea model has been used to study the urea-mediated dewetting between hydrophobic plates.
21
The molecular structures of the
 ﬁ
 ve urea models are slightly di
ﬀ 
erent (the molecular structures of OPLS and KBFF urea are identical, but they are slightly di
ﬀ 
erent from other models). However, the nonbonded parameters, especially  the charge distributions, of these models are quite di
ﬀ 
erent (see Table 1 for the nonbonded parameters of the
 ﬁ
 ve urea models). Note that the OPLS and KBFF urea models use geometric combination rules for parameters of the Lennard-Jones 6
-
12 potential, whereas the CHARMM, AMBER*, and AMBER urea models use Lorentz
-
Bertelot combination rules.  We have prepared two systems to study the phenomenon of  urea-induced drying of SWNTs. The
  ﬁ
rst one, namely, the (17, 8) SWNT system, contains a (17, 8) SWNT with dimensions of  3.155 nm in length and 1.729 nm in diameter, solvated in 8 M aqueous urea consisting of 747 urea and 3253 TIP3P
39
 water mol ecu les(see Fig ure 1A) . Sin ce theedge of the (1 7, 8) SW NT is irregular, only the axially central region of SWNT (2.555 nm in length) is considered when counting water/urea molecules for comparison. The second one, namely, the (6, 6) SWNT system, contains a (6, 6) SWNT with dimensions of 1.35 nm in length and 0.812 nm in diameter, solvated in 8 M aqueous urea consisting of 225 urea and 973 TIP3P water molecules (see Figure 3A). The (17, 8) and (6, 6) SWNTs were aligned along the
 z
-axis in a cubic solvation box with initial side lengths of 5.55 and 3.75 nm, respectively. The initial coordinates of SWNTs were generated using the nanotube builder plugin of VMD software.
40
The carbon atoms of SWNTs were modeled as uncharged Lennard-Jones particles  with a cros s-section of

 As a first quick comparison of different urea models, we have calcu- lated the average urea dipole moments in bulk for the five urea models under ambient conditions (300 K, 1 atm). To calculate these dipole moments, we have performed five simulations of  616 urea molecules in a cubic box using different urea models. Each simulation length was 10 ns, with the last 9 ns collected for analysis. The dipole moment for each urea model was averaged over all of the urea molecules in the cubic box. We note that for rigid urea models this is not needed in theory, but for flexible mod els th is met ho d of ca lcu lat ion tak es int o acc oun t the influence of thermal fluctuations under ambient conditions on the dipole moment of urea. The resulting dipole moments are 4.77, 4.65, 4.40, 4.65, and 3.19 D, for OPLS, KBFF, CHARMM,  AMBER*, and AMBER urea, respectively. These values for OPLS and KBFF urea are in good agreement with previous literature (4.9
  26
and 4.65 D
  28
for OPLS and KBFF urea, respectively),  where the calculations of the dipole moment were based on a single urea molecule with an equilibrium geometry. For compar- iso n, th e exp eri men tal dip ole mom ent of ure a ha s bee n est ima ted to be 3.83 D

that for OPLS, KBFF, CHARMM, and AMBER* urea, although their charge distributions are quite different, their dipole mo- ments are very similar (the dipole moments for KBFF and  AMBER* urea are almost identical).

 water mixture inside the nanotubes, after the systems have reached equilibrium, are also shown in the insets from an axial view. Surprisingly, in all
ﬁ
 ve cases, most of the water molecules originally inside the SWNT (the urea concentration inside the SWNT is also roughly  8 M from the initial solvation setup) are expelled from the SWNT, and the hydrophobic cores are dominantly occupied by  theurea mol ecu les eve ntu all y.

These results strongly  su gg es t th at a dr y gl ob ul e-l ik e st at e ca n be fo rm ed ins id e th e SW NT ,  which also imply that urea might be able to penetrate a protein hydrophobic core ahead of water, forming some dry globule-like intermediates during the early stages of protein denaturation. To explain the observed urea-induced drying of SWNTs from an energetic perspective, we computed the interaction energies of a solvent molecule in bulk (de
ﬁ
ned as 1.2 nm away from any  atoms of SWNT for any atoms of the solvent) and in (17, 8) SWNT, with the rest of the system [see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information]. Table 3 lists the di

erences in average interaction energies for a solvent molecule in (17, 8) SWNT and in bulk, for all
 ﬁ

3.2. Urea-Induced Drying for the (6, 6) SWNT System.
 To investigate the influence of the diameters of nanotubes on the drying phenomenon, we also performed the simulation of the (6, 6) SWNT in 8 M aqueous urea (see Figure 3A). Parts B

F of  Figu re 3 show the numb er of urea and wate r mole cules insid e the cores of (6, 6) SWNTs as a function of simulation time, with five ure a mod els . Rem ark abl y, in allof th e fiv e ca ses , the(6, 6) SWN T is exclusively occupied by urea molecules. Even though water molec ules o ccup y the (6, 6) SWN T initia lly, th ey can be expe lled from the SWNT core within the first 4 ns. Table 4 lists the average number of solvent molecules and drying factors for the (6, 6) SW NT sys tem wit h dif fer ent ure a mod els . Th ese da ta wer e also averaged over the last 90 ns. We found that the urea-ind uced drying for the (6, 6) SWNT system was more remarkable compared to that for the (17, 8) SWNT system. As displayed in Table 4, the cases of OPLS and AMBER urea exhibit the  weakest and the stro ngest drying effects, resp ectively, among the fiv e ca ses , whe rea s the ca ses of KBF F, CHA RMM , AMB ER* ure a exhibit similar drying effects (the drying factors

This is partly due to the steric effect, since each water molecule, though tiny, still has a finite size; after certain replacements by urea, there might be no room for a single water molecule, so the urea/water number ratio
R 
SWNT
 can be very large.  We also computed the interaction energies for a solvent molecule in the bulk region, and in (6, 6) SWNT, with the rest of the system (see Tables S3 and S4 in Supporting Information). Table 5 lists the di
ﬀ 
erences in average interaction energies for a solvent molecule in (6, 6) SWNT vs in bulk, for all
  ﬁ
 ve urea models. Compared to the results of the (17, 8) system, both the loss in electrostatic interaction energies and the gain in vdW  interaction energies increase, for a solvent moving from the bulk  region to the SWNT core. Similar to the results of the (17, 8) system, the vdW interaction energy each urea gains is about 2
-
3 times larger than water gains, which mainly derives from the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotube (see Table S4 in Supporting Information). Except for the case of  OPLS urea, each urea gains 2.40
-
6.21 kcal/mol on average as it penet rates the SWN T, where as each wate r lo ses 1.91
-
4.41 kcal/ mol on average for the same process. In the case of OPLS urea, although each urea loses 1.80 kcal/mol on average as it pene- trate s the SWN T, each wate r lo ses more inter acti on energ y (2.8 3 kcal/mol on average) for the same process. It should be noted that, although the solvent molecule which moves from the bulk  region to the nanotube core loses interaction energy, it is still likely to penetrate the nanotube,
41
 just like the case of the OPLS urea [it is very costly in overall free energy to leave a completely  empty SWNT cavity, i.e., a dewetting transition; it is very rare to observe a dewetting transition since the water contact angle (and ure a co nta ct ang le) wit h res pec t to thecarbo n nan ot ube hasto be larger than 90

]. These results suggest that the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotube is the driving force for preferential occupancy of urea within (6, 6) SWNT too.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In a prev ious repo rt
24
 we show ed, when th e carbon nano tubes  were solvated in 8 M urea, urea molecules could induce the drying of hydrophobic nanotubes. In the present study, we further study this striking phenomenon with
  ﬁ
 ve di
ﬀ 
erent urea mod els to inv est iga te if thedryin g ph eno men on is sen sit ive to the urea models used. Interestingly, we have observed this urea- induc ed d rying of nanot ubes for all of the
ﬁ
 ve models used in this study, despite that their nonbonded parameters, especially the charge distributions, are quite di
ﬀ 
erent. By decomposing the int era cti on ene rgi es for a ure a and a wa ter mol ecu le int o electrostatic and vdW components, we
  ﬁ
nd that, in all of the
ﬁ
 ve cases, the drying phenomenon results from the stronger disp ersio n interact ion of urea than wate r with nano tube. Furt her, detailed calculations of the association free energy for solvent molecules with SWNT also indicate that the stronger dispersion int era cti on of ure a tha n wa ter wit h nan otu bes is the pre dom ina nt drivi ng force for the urea- indu ced dryi ng proc ess. Alth ough there are a few other urea models

reported in literature, we  believe our current simulations with these
  ﬁ
 ve commonly used urea models are representative and adequate to demonstrate the robustness of the drying phenomenon as well as its underlying physical mechanism. Thus we conclude that the phenomenon of  urea-induced drying of hydrophobic nanotubes and its physical

the present study  implies the existence of a dry globule-like transient state during the urea-induced denaturation of proteins and supports the

 whereby urea has a stronger dispersion interaction with protein than water. In addition, our study highlights the crucial role of dispersion interaction in the selective absorption
