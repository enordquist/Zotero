ABSTRACT The aggregation of ␣-helix-rich proteins into ␤-sheet-rich amyloid ﬁbrils is associated with fatal diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and prion disease. During an aggregation process, protein secondary structure elements—␣-helices— undergo conformational changes to ␤-sheets. The fact that proteins with different sequences and structures undergo a similar transition on aggregation suggests that the sequence nonspeciﬁc hydrogen bond interaction among protein backbones is an important factor. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of a polyalanine model, which is an ␣-helix in its native state and observe a metastable ␤-hairpin intermediate. Although a ␤-hairpin has larger potential energy than an ␣-helix, the entropy of a ␤-hairpin is larger because of fewer constraints imposed by the hydrogen bonds. In the vicinity of the transition temperature, we observe the interconversion of the ␣-helix and ␤-sheet states via a random coil state. We also study the effect of the environment by varying the relative strength of side-chain interactions for a designed peptide—an ␣-helix in its native state. For a certain range of side-chain interaction strengths, we ﬁnd that the intermediate ␤-hairpin state is destabilized and even disappears, suggesting an important role of the environment in the aggregation propensity of a peptide.

INTRODUCTION
A number of misfolded proteins and peptides aggregate into insoluble ﬁbrils. The aggregation of some of these proteins into amyloid ﬁbrils—amyloidosis—is related to fatal diseases.1,2 Recently, proteins not implicated in amyloid diseases were found to form ﬁbril structures in vitro under denaturing conditions3,4 suggesting that the ﬁbril formation is a common feature of destabilized proteins.5 Regardless of sequences and structures of proteins, the ﬁbrils have similar core structures, mainly composed of ␤-sheets.6–8 For example, the native A␤ peptide in Alzheimer’s disease9,10 and prion proteins (PrPC) in prion diseases11,12 are ␣-helix-rich. The aggregation from ␣-rich proteins or peptides involves a conformational transition from ␣-helices to ␤-sheets. A similar transition has also been observed in vitro in some ␣-helical peptides13–17 that

aggregate into amyloid ﬁbrils by means of changing the environment, such as varying the organic solvent condition,15 altering the pH,16 and controlling the redox state.17 Moreover, similar ␣-␤ transitions also occur through the correct folding pathway in proteins with a nonhierarchical folding mechanism.18 For example, ␤-lactoglobulin, a predominantly ␤-sheet protein,18 is observed to form nonnative ␣-helical intermediates on folding. Thus, understanding the ␣-␤ transition is important for both protein folding and protein aggregation.
The secondary structures of proteins, mainly ␣-helices and ␤-sheets, are determined by the amino acid sequence and stabilized by hydrogen bonds. However, under denaturing conditions, proteins with various organization of the secondary structure elements can aggregate into similar ␤-rich amyloid ﬁbrils. We propose that the ␣-helix to ␤-hairpin transition is governed by sequence nonspeciﬁc properties of proteins and peptides (i.e., the hydrogen bond network formed between backbones). It has been suggested that sequence nonspeciﬁc hydrogen bond interaction among the backbones of proteins is an important factor for aggregation.19 We hypothesize that the same type of interaction is also the driving force for the ␣-helix to ␤-sheet transition.
An overwhelming amount of computational simulations20–28 and experimental29–33 and theoretical34–37 studies have been devoted to ␣-helix stability and the helix-coil transition. However, the possibility of ␤-hairpin formation in the folding pathway of peptides/proteins has not been addressed. The self-assembly of ␤-sheets by polyalanine segments, which usually form ␣-helices,20,23 has been observed in silk-like multiblock copolymers.38 Thus, we aim to identify the presence of metastable ␤-hairpin intermediate in the folding pathway of a simple polyalanine peptide, an ␣-helix in its native state.20,23 Because of the limitations of traditional molecular dynamics simulations, simpliﬁed models become crucial in studying protein folding and aggregation.19 –21,39 – 43 Discrete molecular dynamics,20,39,40 the combination of simple models and efﬁ-

cient dynamic simulation algorithms, can access the physical processes in the scale of milliseconds with a single simulation.44 In contrast, the traditional all-atom molecular dynamics simulations can only resolve the time scale of several nanoseconds in one run or reach several microseconds combining a large number of runs.22 Therefore, to observe multiple transitions in a single simulation, we use the discrete molecular dynamics algorithm to study a polyalanine peptide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Discrete Molecular Dynamics

In general, discrete molecular dynamic (DMD) simula-

tions are based on pairwise spherically symmetrical poten-

tials that are discontinuous functions of an interatomic

distance r. Each atom has a speciﬁc type—A, B, C, . . . —

that determines its interaction with other atoms. Each

type is characterized by its mass m. The interaction

potential between atoms A and B is a step function of their

distance r, characterized by distances 0 Ͻ rm ABin Ͻ r1AB . . . Ͻ

rm ABax. If the distance r between two atoms A and B satisﬁes

value of uiAB. If r Ͻ rm ABin, uAB ϭ ϱ and rm ABin are the hardcore

collision distance. If r Ͼ rm ABax, uAB ϭ 0, and rm ABax are the

maximal range of interaction. If atoms A and B are linked

by a covalent bond, they interact according to a different

potential characterized by values r˜iAB and u˜ iAB. In this case, if r Ͼ r˜m ABax, u˜ AB ϭ ϱ, which indicates that the bond is
permanent and cannot be broken under any conditions.

In DMD, all atoms move with a constant velocity unless

their distance becomes equal to riAB. At this moment of time, their velocities change instantaneously. This change

satisﬁes the laws of energy, momentum, and angular

momentum conservation. When the kinetic energy of the

particles is not sufﬁcient to overcome the potential barrier

⑀iAB ϭ uiAϪB 1 Ϫ uiAB, the atoms undergo a hardcore reﬂection with no potential energy change. The main difﬁculty of

this method is the effective sorting and updating of the

collision times. However, it is possible to make the speed of

the algorithm inversely proportional to N ln N where N is

the total number of atoms.45 For a sufﬁciently large

number of steps, the method becomes equivalent to a

regular MD based on Newtonian dynamics.

The speed of the algorithm also decays linearly with the

number of steps in the potential and strongly decays with

the density of the system. This method is very effective in

simulating proteins (where the density is small and most

of the interactions can be modeled by using either a

hardcore or a simple square well) and allows us to observe

protein folding transitions and aggregations.19,40–42

Four-Bead Model
The protein model, using three backbone beads and one side-chain bead to represent each residue20,43 has been developed to mimic protein backbone structure. Molecular dynamics studies in such a polypeptide system have shown a sharp helix-coil transition,20 which suggests that it is possible to study the transition from an ␣-helix to ␤-sheet in this model system. Thus, we use the four-bead

The kth amino acid is composed of nitrogen (Nk), prime carbon (Ck), alpha carbon (C␣k), and beta carbon (C␤k) atoms [Fig. 1(a)]. In Figure 1(a) the thick lines represent
the covalent bonds, and the thin lines denote effective

First, we study the peptide with only backbone hydrogen
bond interaction. The nonbonded atom pairs have either

hardcore collision or hydrogen bond interactions. The
hardcore radius RA of four different types of atoms are listed in Table I (rm ABin ϭ RA ϩ RB). The protein backbone hydrogen bonds are formed between the carbonyl oxygen
and amide hydrogen. In the four-bead model, there is no
carbonyl oxygen and amide hydrogen, but the position of O
and H can be determined by their neighboring N, G, and
C␣ atoms. We model the hydrogen bond formed between the nitrogen Ni of the ith amino acid and the prime carbon Cj of the jth amino acid. Following the same notation as applied in Res. 20, 21, and 43, the separation along the sequence must satisfy the condition i Ϫ j Ն 4 to form a backbone hydrogen bond between Ni and Cj. It is well known that the hydrogen bond interaction has strong
angular dependence (i.e., the hydrogen bonded CO and NH
groups are collinear with each other). The usual pairwise
interaction can hardly model this multibody interaction.

Hydrogen Bond Interaction: Reaction Algorithm
We introduce the reaction algorithm to model the hydrogen bond interaction between Ni and Cj. Once Ni and Cj form a hydrogen bond, they change their type into NiЈ and CjЈ, respectively, and cannot form any other hydrogen bonds. Whether the “reaction” Ni ϩ Cj º NiЈ ϩ CjЈ takes place is assessed when the distance between these atoms becomes equal to the hydrogen bond cutoff distance DHB ϭ 4.2 A˚ . The total potential energy change includes the potential energy gain ⑀HB between NiЈ and CjЈ, and the potential energy changes between the two atoms and their surrounding atoms because of the type changes. Once the kinetic energy is enough to overcome the total potential energy change, the forward reaction happens. Otherwise, the two atoms Ni and Cj do not change their types and undergo original hardcore collision. If the reaction is successful, the atoms change their atom types and interact with other atoms according to the interaction parameters related to their new types.
We implement the angular dependence of hydrogen bonds by assigning an auxiliary interaction between the atom pairs NiЈ™C␣j, NiЈ™Nj[Јϩ] 1, CjЈ™C␣i, and CjЈ™Ci[ЈϪ] 1 [these four pairs are connected by thin lines in Fig. 1(b); the bracket in the superscript indicates that the atom may or may not have its type changed because of hydrogen bond formation] as

where ⑀HB is the potential energy gain between Ni and Cj, and the parameters d0, d1, dmin, and dmax are chosen to implement the hydrogen bond angular constraints (see
Table II). The other interactions involving the Ni and Cj atoms remain unchanged before and after the reaction.
The new hardcore collision distance between NiЈ and CjЈ is assigned at 4.0 Å. Thus, at the lowest energy state of a
hydrogen bond, the distance of the four auxiliary pairs is
within the distance range of [d1, dmax], and distance of Ni and Cj is within the hydrogen bond range [4.0 Å, 4.2 Å]: the

CO and NH groups are aligned as approximately linear. Parameters dmin and d0 are chosen to allow angular distortion with energy penalizations.
When two atoms Ni and Cj approach each other at the hydrogen bond interaction cutoff distance DHB ϭ 4.2 Å, we evaluate the total potential energy change by checking the four auxiliary interactions. The potential energy change can be Ϫ⑀HB, Ϫ⑀HB/2, 0, ⑀HB/2, . . . 3⑀HB and ϱ, depending on the orientation of the Ni, Cj, and their neighbors. The larger the angular distortion, the higher the potential energy change. Once formed, the four auxiliary pairs will have a high probability of staying in the range of [d1, dmax] with the lowest energy; thus, the orientation of the hydrogen bond is maintained. The thermal ﬂuctuations distort the orientation of the hydrogen bond and large ﬂuctuations may break the hydrogen bond. Once the two atoms NiЈ and CjЈ come again to the exact distance of DHB, a reverse reaction may happen. We check the potential energy change due to the possible changes of types. The total potential energy change ranges between Ϫ3⑀HB to ⑀HB, corresponding to different conformations of the hydrogen bond due to thermal ﬂuctuations. Thus, a distorted hydrogen bond will be easier to break. A more realistic modeling of the angular dependence of the hydrogen bond is to increase the number of steps in Eq. 1 to make the interaction potential more continuous. However, the increase of the number of steps decreases the efﬁciency of the discrete molecular dynamics.
16-mer With Hydrophobic Polar Sequence
We also study the effect of side-chain interactions in a 16-residue model peptide chain, designed to be an ␣-helix in its native state. The peptide has the following sequence of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) residues: PPHPPHHPPHPPHHPP.21,46 This sequence is derived from a peptide that is designed to be an ␣-helix in the experiment.47 In our simulations, the interaction between hydrophobic sidechains (C␤ atoms) is modeled as an attractive square well with the cutoff distance DHP ϭ 6.5 Å and the interaction strength ⑀HP; the remaining side-chain interactions are hardcore collisions. The relative strength of the hydrophobic interactions with respect to the hydrogen bond interactions ␳ ϭ ⑀HP/⑀HB is a free parameter that can be tuned.
POLYALANINE WITH HYDROGEN BOND INTERACTION ONLY
We study the refolding thermodynamics of the 16residue polyalanine with only backbone hydrogen bond interactions. We perform discrete molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures T ϭ 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.125, 0.13, 0.14, and 0.15 in units of ⑀HB/kB (e.g., for

For each temperature, the ten different potential energy trajectories of 106 time unites (t.u.) are separated by dashed lines and colored differently. At temperature T ϭ 0.120, we transitions are observed from the ␤-hairpin to the ␣-helix states (the 8th run) and from the ␣-helix to the ␤-hairpin states (the 9th run).

⑀HB ϭ 5 kcal/mol,48 the temperature T ϭ 0.12 corresponds to 302 K) where kB is the Boltzmann constant. For each temperature, we perform 10 separate molecular dynamics simulations starting from different random coil conformations (Fig. 2).
At high temperatures, the polyalanine remains at the random coil state, and its average potential energy is close to zero. As we decrease the temperature, the peptide adopts a ␤-hairpin state [Fig. 2(d)]. For a ␤-hairpin structure, the lowest potential energy conformations have the ␤-turn located near the center of the peptide [Fig. 3(b)], and the potential energy is equal to Ϫ6⑀HB. If the turn is positioned differently along the peptide [Fig. 3(c)], the potential energy is higher than Ϫ6⑀HB because of the smaller number of hydrogen bonds that can be formed. Thus, the occurrence of additional ␤-hairpin types [Fig. 3(c)] is less probable. At temperature T ϭ 0.13 [(Fig. 2(e)], we observe a reversible random coil to ␤-hairpin transition, and the probabilities of ﬁnding a random coil and a ␤-hairpin state are approximately equal [Fig. 2(a,e)], so the ␤-hairpin to random coil transition temperature is T␤ Ϫ coil Ϸ 0.13. At temperature T ϭ 0.13, we also detect rare ﬂuctuations with potential energy lower than Ϫ6⑀HB, corresponding to partially formed ␣-helix states.
As we lower the temperature to T ϭ 0.125, we observe the occurrence of ␣-helical states [Fig. 2(g) and Fig. 3(a)]. For the 16-residue polyalanine, the complete ␣-helix has four helix turns and the lowest energy is Ϫ12⑀HB. At T ϭ 0.125, the peptide can either adopt a random coil, an ␣-helix, or a ␤-hairpin state. The interconversion between an ␣-helix and a ␤-hairpin only takes place if the peptide ﬁrst unfolds to a random coil state. This is mainly due to the drastic structural difference between these two kinds of conformations and there is no direct pathway between them except via a random coil state. Thus, the ␣-helix to ␤-hairpin transition is coupled to the transition between the ␣-helix to random coil transition. The probability of an ␣-helix is smaller than that of a ␤-hairpin at temperature T ϭ 0.125. We expect to observe more ␣-helix states at lower temperatures. However, at low temperatures, the dynamics of hydrogen bond formation and disruption become slow, and the polyalanine is easily trapped in the local minima of the free energy landscape, dominated by a metastable ␤-hairpin state. We ﬁnd that the peptide remains in either an ␣-helix or a ␤-hairpin state during the simulation time of 106 time units40 after a quick collapse from the random coil state [Fig. 2(g,h,i)]
We present the distribution of the torsion angles ␾ and ␺ for different states in Figure 3(e,f,g). The distributions are in agreement with the Ramachandran plot49 for secondary structures. We ﬁnd that the distributions of the ␤-hairpin and random coil are similar. However, for the random coil state, the torsion angles for each amino acid are fully uncorrelated, whereas for the ␤-hairpin state, the torsion angles between the hydrogen bonded amino acids are highly correlated. For an ␣-helix, each residue forms two hydrogen bonds except those near the termini [Fig. 4(a)]; thus, our peptide does not have excessive torsional freedom. On the other hand, for a ␤-hairpin strand, approxi-

mately half of all amino acids do not form any hydrogen bonds [Fig. 4(b)], the peptide chain has a larger value of backbone entropy. Therefore, the ␤-hairpin has larger hydrogen bond energy and also a larger entropy than the ␣-helix. To illustrate the backbone ﬂexibility for different states (␣-helix, ␤-hairpin, random coil), we align various conformations with respect to a characteristic structure using C␣ atoms for each of these states [Fig. 3(h,i,j)]. We ﬁnd that the ␤-hairpin [Fig. 3(i)] is more ﬂexible than the ␣-helix [Fig. 3(h)]; therefore, the ␤-hairpin has a higher backbone entropy. (We provide movies for the dynamic motions of an ␣-helix and a ␤-hairpin, and one instance of the ␣-helix to ␤-hairpin transition: http://www.unc.edu/ ~dokh/research/AB/home.html). It is of interest that the alignment for the random coil state exhibits a persistent overall topology [Fig. 3(i)], which is possibly due to the excluded volume effect of the residues and is consistent with the ﬁnding in Ref. 50. The interplay between energy and entropy allows for the existence of the metastable intermediate state—the ␤-hairpin.
Because of the slow dynamics at low temperatures, we cannot accurately identify the ␣-helix to ␤-hairpin transition temperature T␣ Ϫ ␤. The coexistence of these two states with the random coil state at T ϭ 0.125 suggests that the transition temperature T␣ Ϫ ␤ is close to 0.125,

␣-HELIX TO ␤-HAIRPIN TRANSITION

225

which is in the vicinity of the ␤-hairpin to coil transition temperature T␤-coil ϭ 0.130. Each of the four amino acids near the N- or C-termini of an ␣-helix has one free hydrogen bond donor or acceptor [Fig. 4(a)], similar to the ␤-hairpin strand where each amino acid on average has one free hydrogen bond donor or acceptor [Fig. 4(b)]. Thus, the potential energy per residue of the ␣-helix terminal is equal to that of a ␤-hairpin strand. According to the similar constraints imposed by the hydrogen bonds, we hypothesize that the conformational entropy per residue for the ␤-hairpin strands and ␣-helix termini is also similar. Thus, the ␣-helix termini and ␤-hairpin strands have similar free energy per residue. Furthermore, the amino acids near the termini have larger free energies than those of the amino acids within the helix, which is consistent with the observation of large ﬂuctuations of the termini even at low temperature. We observe that the polyalanine melting (i.e., the transition into random coil) always starts from the termini. The melting temperature of an ␣-helix T␣-coil is determined by the free energy per residue between the ␣-helix termini and the random coil, and the transition temperature from a ␤-hairpin to random coil T␤-coil is determined by the free energy per residue between ␤-hairpin strands and the random coil. So, T␣-coil is close to T␤-coil. Because the ␣-helix to ␤-hairpin transition is coupled with the ␣-helix to coil transition (␣-helix melting), T␣-␤ Ϸ T␤-coil.
To further understand the contribution of backbone entropy to the ␣-helix to ␤-hairpin transition, we estimate the backbone entropy for different states. From the alignment of conformations in Figure 3(h,i,j); we ﬁnd that all conformations ﬂuctuate around the reference structure characteristic to the corresponding state. Assuming that 1) the ﬂuctuations of the structures around the reference structure are Gaussian and 2) the ﬂuctuations of residues are uncorrelated, the conformational entropy can be approximated as Sx ϭ 3N ln͗rmsdr͘x ϩ S0, where rmsdr is the root-mean-square deviation from the reference structure. The average ͗͘x is taken over conformations out of the corresponding state {x}: ␣-helix, ␤-hairpin, and random coil. S0 is a constant that can be determined by setting the ␣-helix as the reference state with S␣ ϭ 0. Because the four atoms in each residue are constrained to ﬂuctuate as one object, N represents the number of amino acids. To calculate the entropy, we perform equilibrium simulations with hydrogen bonds intact (the ␣-helix and ␤-hairpin states) or without forming any hydrogen bonds (the random coil state). We calculate ͗rmsdr͘x with respect to a selected conformation typical to the corresponding state. The values of estimated entropy for different states are listed in Table III. The transition temperatures can be determined as T␤-coil ϭ 0.162, T␣-coil ϭ 0.133, and T␣-␤ ϭ 0.115. These estimated transition temperatures agree with the values determined from simulations. The above assumptions might lead to underestimation of the backbone entropy for the random coil state; therefore, the estimated transition temperatures T␤-coil and T␣-coil are higher than the determined values from simulations.

The existence of the metastable ␤-hairpin state has important implications for aggregation. A ␤-hairpin conformation that has the exposed hydrogen bond donors or acceptors is capable of further aggregation and can form amyloid ﬁbrils.51 Most real proteins do not aggregate by folding into the native state without long lifetime intermediates. Proper folding may be enforced by side-chain interactions in the evolutionarily selected sequence. We study a minimal model with hydrophobic side-chain interactions to uncover the propensities of the ␣-helix to ␤-hairpin transition for a hydrophobic-polar (HP) sequence, which is designed to be an ␣-helix in the native state.
MODEL PEPTIDE WITH HYDROPHOBIC-POLAR SEQUENCE
We perform molecular dynamics simulations of the HP peptide with various interaction ratios ␳ ϭ ⑀HP/⑀HB, from 0.05 to 0.50 with a step of 0.05. For each ratio, we perform simulations at various temperatures. We ﬁnd that the ␤-hairpin state becomes less stable as we increase ␳. For small ␳, the thermodynamic property of our HP peptide resembles that of the peptide without speciﬁc side-chain interactions. At a characteristic range of ␳ values (0.20 Յ ␳ Յ 0.35), the intermediate ␤-hairpin state disappears and the peptide folds cooperatively into the native ␣-helix state (Fig. 5).
For ␳ ϭ 0.25, the speciﬁc heat has a pronounced peak around TF ϭ 0.128 (Fig. 5), indicating a sharp transition speciﬁc to a two-state protein. At low temperatures, the peptide adopts the native ␣-helix structure [Fig. 5(d,e)]. At temperature T ϭ 0.120, we also observe some potential energy ﬂuctuations corresponding to the partially unfolded ␣-helix with the unfolded N- and C-termini. In the vicinity of the transition temperature, the peptide adopts both the ␣-helix and the unfolded states. The hydrophobic interactions are formed with a higher probability even at high temperatures than the hydrogen bonds because of the larger interaction range (DHP ϭ 6.5 Å Ͼ DHB ϭ 4.2 Å) and the absence of angular dependence of the HP interactions. Snapshots of these unfolded states indicate that the HP peptide adopts “molten globular”52 conformations [Fig. 5(f)], which have contacts formed between the hydrophobic residues. The average radius of gyration Rg for the molten globular state at temperature T ϭ 0.135 is 7.35 Å, compared to the unfolded state Rg ϭ 10.3 Å for ␳ ϭ 0 at the

same temperature. We ﬁnd that the HP peptide ﬁrst collapses into the “molten globular” state from the random coil state, which is similar to the coil-globular transition,52 at a higher temperature than TF.
Within the characteristic range of ␳ values, the difference of the average potential energy between the ␤-hairpin state and the unfolded state is small, which is not enough to stabilize the ␤-hairpin state. For example, for ␳ ϭ 0.25 (Fig. 5), the average potential energy of the unfolded state is Ϫ4⑀HB at TF, and the potential energy of the ␤-hairpin state Ϸ Ϫ6⑀HB is within the range of potential energy ﬂuctuation of the unfolded state [Fig. 5(c)]. However, the potential energy gap between the ␣-helix state and the unfolded state is 8⑀HB [(Fig. 5(c)], which is large enough to stabilize the ␣-helix state.53
As we increase ␳, we rarely observe the helix-coil transition (e.g., for ␳ ϭ 0.50 the ␣-helix state is never reached from the unfolded state during the simulation of 107 time units). At low temperatures, our HP peptide is frozen in the molten globular states because of the strong hydrophobic interactions.
DISCUSSION
A missing link in understanding the amyloidogenesis of ␣-helix-rich proteins to ␤-sheet-rich ﬁbrils is the possible presence of a metastable ␤-hairpin intermediate state,

prone to aggregation.51 Our results suggest a generic framework that explains why this ␤-hairpin intermediate is favorable in terms of free energy. Although the potential energy of the ␤-hairpin state is higher than that of the ␣-helix state, the entropy of a ␤-hairpin is signiﬁcantly larger than that of an ␣-helix due to fewer constraints imposed by hydrogen bonds. At high temperatures, the free energy of a ␤-hairpin can be smaller than that of an ␣-helix. Even though our simulations and discussions are focused on the ␤-hairpin (an antiparallel two-stranded ␤-sheet), our analysis is appropriate for both parallel and antiparallel two-stranded ␤-sheets that are entropically favorable with respect to ␣-helices.
Our simulations of temperature-driven ␣-helix to ␤-hairpin transition are consistent with recent experiments on the solvent-driven conformational transitions.54,55 By changing the solvents from one type that has a low ability to interact with the backbone peptide groups to another type that has a higher ability,55 the designed peptides are found to convert from ␣-helices to ␤-hairpins. Increasing the ability of the solvent to interact with the backbone, the energy gain to form a backbone hydrogen bond is effectively decreased. Instead of increasing the temperature, the decrease of the hydrogen bond’s energy gain drives the conformational transition from ␣-helix to ␤-hairpin because of the dominating effect of backbone entropy.

␣-HELIX TO ␤-HAIRPIN TRANSITION

Most proteins in physiological conditions do not aggregate. Proteins with evolutionarily selected sequences avoid aggregation by folding into the native state without metastable intermediate states. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that changes in environmental conditions lead to aggregation.5,16 The environmental change has a different effect on different types of interactions. Our simulations of HP sequences with various hydrophobic interaction strengths show that if the environmental changes effectively lead to the weakening of the relative side-chain interactions, the peptide or protein may misfold into a metastable ␤-hairpin intermediate.
Discrete molecular dynamics simulation methodology is a step in simpliﬁcation of molecular modeling with respect to traditional molecular dynamics simulations. The principal drawback of the discrete molecular dynamics simulations is its difﬁculty to represent forces. Instead, system’s dynamics is realized through ballistic collisions between particles. Interactions between particles are modeled by square-well potentials. Despite its simplicity, discrete molecular dynamics has been proved to be a powerful tool not only to study protein folding thermodynamics39–42 and kinetics,41,42,56 but to identify the evasive protein transition state ensembles41 and to witness aggregation of multiple proteins into amyloid ﬁbrils.19 The latter two goals have yet to be directly approached with traditional molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, the traditional all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are also a simpliﬁcation of the quantum mechanics simulations, in which quantum interactions are replaced by approximate Newtonian interactions. The latter, in turn, are approximated by a large number of empirical parameters. The advantage of the discrete molecular dynamics simulations versus traditional molecular dynamics simulations is its ability to resolve larger timescales—106 orders of magnitude. The traditional molecular mechanics simulations have similar advantage over quantum mechanics simulations. The traditional molecular dynamics simulations are based on several decades of improving and testing of model force ﬁeld, whereas applications of discrete molecular dynamics simulations have been limited until recently to colloids and hard spheres. Despite this, we believe that modifying and improving parameters of discrete molecular dynamics simulations for proteins by testing them on simple systems such as the polyalanine chain studied here will eventually lead to models with quantitative predictive power.
