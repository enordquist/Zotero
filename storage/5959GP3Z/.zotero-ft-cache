Water Activity of Sucrose and NaCl Solutions

One way to reduce the growth rate of pathogens is to reduce the water activity of solutions in which they live. Sucrose (sugar) and NaCl (salt) are often used to adjust the water activity of foods. The following tables indicate to what extent NaCl and sucrose reduce water activity.
