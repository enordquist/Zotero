Con®nement of matter on the nanometre scale can induce phase transitions not seen in bulk systems1. In the case of water, socalled drying transitions occur on this scale2±5 as a result of strong hydrogen-bonding between water molecules, which can cause the liquid to recede from nonpolar surfaces to form a vapour layer separating the bulk phase from the surface6. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations showing spontaneous and continuous ®lling of a nonpolar carbon nanotube with a one-dimensionally ordered chain of water molecules. Although the molecules forming the chain are in chemical and thermal equilibrium with the surrounding bath, we observe pulse-like transmis-

sion of water through the nanotube. These transmission bursts result from the tight hydrogen-bonding network inside the tube, which ensures that density ¯uctuations in the surrounding bath lead to concerted and rapid motion along the tube axis7±9. We also ®nd that a minute reduction in the attraction between the tube wall and water dramatically affects pore hydration, leading to sharp, two-state transitions between empty and ®lled states on a nanosecond timescale. These observations suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their rigid nonpolar structures10,11, might be exploited as unique molecular channels for water and protons, with the channel occupancy and conductivity tunable by changes in the local channel polarity and solvent conditions.
We designed a short12 uncapped, single-walled nanotube 13.4 AÊ long with a diameter of 8.1 AÊ , and simulated for 66 ns the dynamics of this nanotube solvated in a water reservoir. Despite its strongly hydrophobic character, the initially empty central channel of the nanotube is rapidly ®lled by water from the surrounding reservoir, and remains occupied by about ®ve water molecules during the entire 66 ns (Fig. 1a). These water molecules form a hydrogenbonded chain (Fig. 1c). The number of water molecules, N, ¯uctuates between 2 and 7, with N  2 occurring only once in 66 ns (Figs 1a and 2a). The radial and axial density pro®les of the water in the nanotube show considerable structure and density depletion at the nanotube openings (Figs 2b and c).
Water molecules entering the nanotube lose on average two out of four hydrogen bonds. Only a fraction of the lost energy (,10 kcal mol-1) can be recovered through van der Waals interactions with the carbon atoms of the nanotube (,4 kcal mol-1), while electrostatic interactions with water molecules beyond the nanotube wall are found to be negligible. Considering this loss of hydrogen bonding, and the weak attraction of water to the nanotube carbon atoms, with a Lennard±Jones well depth of only about 0.114 kcal mol-1, this persistent hydration of the nanotube interior seems surprising, but is consistent with the experimentally inferred adsorption of water onto nanotubes13. Further support comes from recent simulations14 showing that a potassium iodide melt would be sucked into carbon nanotubes to form nano-crystallites, despite favourable solvation in the surrounding liquid.
The water occupancy of the channel is determined by the local excess chemical potential, menxt, de®ned as the negative free energy of removing a water molecule from the channel. This free energy is dominated not by how strongly bound a water molecule is on average, but by how populated weakly bound states are (see Methods, equation (2)). The average binding

energy of water molecules inside the nanotube is indeed unfavour-
able compared to bulk water. Nevertheless, the binding energies
inside the nanotube are more sharply distributed (Fig. 3a), and high-
energy states dominating the free energy are less frequently occu-
pied. As a consequence, although water molecules at the centre of the nanotube (within 0.8 AÊ of the cylinder axis) lose on average 2 kcal mol-1 in energy, they have a lower excess chemical potential of menxt < 2 6:87 6 0:07 kcal mol21, compared to bulk TIP3P water (mewx < 2 6:05 6 0:02 kcal mol21. The resulting chemical-potential difference (Fig. 3b) of menxt 2 mewx < 2 0:82 6 0:09 kcal mol21 agrees with the estimate from the average occupancy number, 2 kBT lnhNi=r0DV  2 0:87 kcal mol21 (see Methods, equation (1)).
Hydrogen bonds inside the nanotube are shielded from ¯uctua-
tions in the environment. Only 0.02% of water pairs in contact (within 3.5 AÊ oxygen-atom distance) are unbound with a pair
energy uij . 0, compared to 15% in bulk water. Hydrogen bonds in the nanotube are highly oriented, with less than 15% of the H±O ¼O angles exceeding 308, compared to 37% in bulk water. The average lifetime of a hydrogen bond15 (oxygen distance # 3:5 AÊ , hydrogen-bond angle # 308) is 5.6 ps, compared to
1.0 ps for bulk water. OH bonds involved in hydrogen bonds are
nearly aligned with the nanotube axis, collectively ¯ipping direction16 every 2±3 ns on average. Despite this quasi-one-dimen-
sional order, the water chain retains considerable entropy: water
molecules can rotate freely about their aligned hydrogen bonds,
resulting in a degenerate energetic `ground state' and the narrow
distribution of binding energies shown in Fig. 3a.
Water molecules not only penetrate into, but are also conducted
through, the nanotube. During the 66 ns, 1,119 water molecules
entered the nanotube on one side and left on the other side,
corresponding to an average of about 17 water molecules per

nanosecond passing through the nanotube (51 3 10214 cm3 s21). The measured water ¯ow through the twice as long channel of the transmembrane protein aquaporin-1 is of comparable magnitude17. Water conduction occurs in pulses through the nanotube with peaks of about 30 water molecules per nanosecond (Fig. 4a), reminiscent of single ion channel activity18. Slow ¯uctuations of the occupancy number have been observed by simulation in the pore region of a synthetic transmembrane channel19. The burst-like water conduction follows from the tight hydrogen-bond network inside the nanotube. Rupturing the water chain is energetically costly, and thus rare. Fluctuations outside the nanotube lead to highly concerted, yet rapid, drift-like motion of the water molecules along the nanotube axis7±9, resulting in bursts in the water ¯ow (Fig. 4). During those bursts, the water chain moves with little resistance through the `greasy' nanotube, unhindered by interactions with the hydrophobic wall (Fig. 4b).
To explore the role of attractive interactions20,21, we reduce the depth of the carbon±water van der Waals potential well by 0.05 kcal mol-1 (see Methods). Modifying the attractive potential mimics changes in the local polarity and solvent conditions. This seemingly small perturbation of the nanotube drastically affects its water occupancy, which ¯uctuates in sharp transitions between empty and ®lled states during a 25-ns simulation (Fig. 1b). Intermediate states are rarely populated (Fig. 2a), re¯ecting the large

We conclude that, counter to intuition, hydrophobic channels

can have signi®cant water occupancy despite a reduction in the

number of hydrogen bonds compared to the bulk ¯uid. Small

changes in the nanotube±water interactions can lead to large

changes in the water occupancy of the channel, with two-state

transitions between empty and ®lled states. This might have

biological signi®cance, and offer an explanation for crystallo-

graphically empty, yet functionally ®lled, hydrophobic channels in

proton-transferring proteins22. Changes in amino-acid ionization

states could trigger water in¯ux and establish protonic connectiv-

ities. Emptying/®lling transitions in membrane-inserted, function-

alized nanotubes, driven, for example, by light-induced excitation

of covalently bound dye molecules, could potentially be used in light

sensors as single-molecule `®eld-effect transistors' for protonic

currents.

Methods
Molecular dynamics simulations
The 144-carbon (6,6) nanotube (13.4 AÊ long and 8.1 AÊ in diameter) is formed by folding a graphite sheet of 5 3 12 carbon rings to a cylinder. Solvated in a cubic box with 1,034 TIP3P water molecules23, the nanotube is free to translate and rotate. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed at constant pressure24 (1 bar, box length L  32:06 6 0:04 AÊ ) and temperature (300 K) with AMBER 6.0 (University of California at San Francisco), with particle-mesh Ewald electrostatics25 and cubic-spline interpolation (,1 AÊ grid width). A time step of 2 fs was used. Structures were saved every 1 ps. The carbon atoms are modelled as uncharged Lennard±Jones particles with a cross-section of jCC  3:400 AÊ and a depth of the potential well of eCC  0:086 kcal mol21, corresponding to sp2 carbons in the AMBER96 force ®eld26. Carbon±carbon bond lengths of 1.4 AÊ and bond angles of 1208 are maintained by harmonic potentials with spring constants of 938 kcal mol-1 AÊ -2 and 126 kcal mol-1 rad-2. In addition, a weak dihedral angle potential is applied to bonded carbon atoms. The carbon±water Lennard±Jones parameters are jCO  3:2751 AÊ and eCO  0:114333 kcal mol21. We also conducted a 25-ns simulation with modi®ed carbon± water Lennard±Jones interactions of j9CO  3:4138 AÊ and e9CO  0:06461 kcal mol21, thus weakening the water±nanotube van der Waals attractions by a factor of about two. For reference, bulk TIP3P water was simulated for 3 ns (256 molecules, 300 K at a density of 0.987 g cm-3).

Water occupancy and chemical potentials

The average number hNi of water molecules in a volume DV inside the nanotube is
determined by the difference of the local excess chemical potential menxt relative to that of the bulk ¯uid, mewx:

hNi  r0DV exp 2 bmenxt 2 mewx

1

where menxt 2 mewx corresponds to a potential-of-mean-force difference for water; r0 is the bulk water density; and b21  kBT, with kB Boltzmann's constant, and T the temperature.

The binding energy u of a given water molecule is the potential-energy difference of the
system in a given con®guration with and without that molecule. The distribution pbind(u) of binding energies is related to the distribution pins(u) of potential energies u of water molecules randomly inserted into the volume DV, and averaged over equilibrium con®gurations of the unperturbed system27:

Histograms for energies of water molecule removal, pbind(u), and insertion, pins(u), were determined for bulk water, and for the central channel of the nanotube. For the nanotube
histograms pbind(u) and pins(u), water molecules were, respectively, removed from and randomly inserted into a cylindrical volume DV concentric with the nanotube. The radius and height of DV are 0.8 and 13.4 AÊ , as de®ned by the carbon atoms at the rim. Excess
chemical potentials of water in the nanotube channel and in bulk TIP3P water were then determined from a histogram analysis27 of the energy distributions by ®tting lnpbindu=pinsu to bmewx 2 u.
