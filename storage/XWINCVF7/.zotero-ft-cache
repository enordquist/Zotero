Recent advances in implicit solvent-based methods for
biomolecular simulations Jianhan Chen1, Charles L Brooks III2 and Jana Khandogin3

Implicit solvent-based methods play an increasingly important role in molecular modeling of biomolecular structure and dynamics. Recent methodological developments have mainly focused on the extension of the generalized Born (GB) formalism for variable dielectric environments and accurate treatment of nonpolar solvation. Extensive efforts in parameterization of GB models and implicit solvent force Ô¨Åelds have enabled ab initio simulation of protein folding to native or near-native structures. Another exciting area that has beneÔ¨Åted from the advances in implicit solvent models is the development of constant pH molecular dynamics methods, which have recently been applied to the calculations of protein pKa values and the studies of pH-dependent peptide and protein folding.

Introduction Proper description of the solvent environment is crucial in simulations of biological molecules and assemblies. Although the accuracy of general purpose molecular mechanics force Ô¨Åelds has consistently improved over the years, substantial limitations remain when it comes to exploring large conformational reorganization of biomolecules, such as in protein folding. Many of these limitations are related to the need for an accurate and efÔ¨Åcient description of solvent. Explicit inclusion of water molecules (and/or membrane lipid molecules) arguably provides the highest level of detail, but, at the same time, signiÔ¨Åcantly increases the system size and thus the associated computational cost. Alternatively, one may explicitly include only the solute degrees of freedom, and assume

that the mean inÔ¨Çuence of solvent can be captured by the free energy cost of solvating the solute in a given conÔ¨Åguration. Such an implicit treatment of solvent not only substantially reduces the system size but also allows faster sampling of the solute conformation because of the absence of solvent friction. Recent methodological developments in implicit solvent models have allowed accurate calculation of the solvation free energy with moderate computational cost, leading to an explosion of applications, ranging from protein folding/misfolding to drug design. The rapid calculation of the solvation free energy (i.e. without the necessity to average over the solvent degrees of freedom) has also greatly facilitated the development of other novel simulation methods, in particular, constant pH molecular dynamics (MD) techniques, which have opened a door to the theoretical study of many important pH-dependent conformational processes. There have been a number of excellent reviews on different aspects of implicit solvent models as well as the constant pH MD methods in the past few years [1‚Äì4]. Here, we will brieÔ¨Çy review the main approximations underlying the implicit solvent models, and focus on the important advances in development and applications that were published during the period from early 2004 to mid2007. Since the physical and mathematical details of constant pH MD methods have been discussed by Mongan and Case in a recent review [4], we will focus on the methodological advances and application studies that emerged after that review. We will conclude this review with a discussion of possible areas for improvement and future directions of research.
General principles of implicit solvent theories In general, an implicit treatment of solvent aims to capture the mean inÔ¨Çuence of solvent via the direct estimation of the solvation free energy, deÔ¨Åned as the reversible work required to transfer the solute in a Ô¨Åxed conÔ¨Åguration from vacuum to solution. In fully empirical approaches, the solvation free energy is estimated directly from certain geometric properties of the solute, such as the atomic solvent-exposed surface area (SA) or solventexclusion volume, using empirical free energy scales [5,6]. A more rigorous approach is to decompose the total solvation free energy into nonpolar and electrostatic contributions. This allows both contributions to be related to appropriate continuum models of water, and is generally more accurate than the fully empirical approaches. Continuum electrostatics is the most wellestablished theory for the description of electrostatic solvation, where the solute is considered as a cavity

embedded in a high dielectric medium. The corresponding electrostatic solvation free energy can be calculated rigorously by solving the Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann (PB) equation [2], or approximately by using the generalized Born (GB) theory [7]. GB offers higher computational efÔ¨Åciency, and readily allows for the analytical evaluation of forces. Therefore, it is often preferred over PB methods for MD simulations. Furthermore, with continual improvement over the past few years, many GB models are now capable of achieving the same level of accuracy as PB [1].
In contrast to the advances in the development of GB theory, methods for accurate treatment of nonpolar solvation are lacking. The nonpolar solvation free energy is either largely ignored or estimated from the solventaccessible SA. With the signiÔ¨Åcant improvement in the electrostatic solvation models, limitations of simple SA models for biomolecule simulation are becoming increasingly evident [8,9]. Furthermore, the dramatic reduction in the system size with elimination of the solvent molecules comes with some inevitable consequences. For example, implicit solvent may fail to capture short-range effects where detailed interplay of a few water molecules is important. Nonetheless, the GB/ SA combination is now recognized as a prime choice for the implicit treatment of solvent in biomolecular simulations [1]. Various implementations are available in major molecular modeling software packages, and have found applications to a wide range of biological problems.
Recent methodological developments
Modeling variable dielectric environments Standard GB models are designed and parameterized for the typical situation with a solute dielectric constant of ep ¬º 1 and a solvent dielectric constant of ew  80. In these models, the effective Born radii only depend on the molecular geometry, but not on the solute and solvent dielectric constants. This can be problematic, for example, if one wants to study the free energy of transfer of a solute between two solvents with different dielectric constants. Feig et al. proposed an empirical extension that includes explicit dependence of the effective Born radii on the dielectric environment and demonstrated improved agreement with the reference ‚Äòexact‚Äô PB solutions [10]. The theory was later extended to model biological membranes as multiple layers of inÔ¨Ånite dielectric slabs [11]. Starting from Kirkwood‚Äôs exact solution for the case of a random charge distribution in a sphere, Onufriev and coworkers derived an approximate analytical solution that does not require summing inÔ¨Ånite series, and later extended it to handle arbitrary molecular shape [12,13]. More recently, Zhou and coworker proposed heavily parameterized GB models that directly scale the total solvation free energy using empirical functions derived from Ô¨Åtting to the PB results, in addition to several other modiÔ¨Åcations [14]. Although the errors of

the total solvation free energy of proteins relative to the PB results are effectively reduced, it is not clear how well these models reproduce the exact effective Born radii for both buried and exposed atoms.
Optimization of GB implicit solvent force Ô¨Åelds Consistent with the view that the GB framework has reached a mature stage (for standard aqueous simulations), there have been extensive efforts directed toward optimizing the GB/SA implicit solvent force Ô¨Åelds in recent years. We emphasize the important difference between the ‚Äònumerical‚Äô accuracy and ‚Äòphysical‚Äô accuracy of the GB models. The former property refers to the ability of a GB theory to numerically reproduce the corresponding ‚Äòexact‚Äô PB solution, given the same solvent boundary and other physical parameters (e.g. the intrinsic atomic radii); the latter refers to the ability in reproducing actual (often experimental) physical properties, such as the solvation free energy, native structure, and thermodynamic stability. Achieving high physical accuracy does not only require a GB model to be numerically accurate but also depends on a range of physical parameters including the intrinsic atomic radii, deÔ¨Ånition of the solvent boundary (if adjustable), and very importantly, the underlying protein force Ô¨Åeld. Also note that the optimized physical parameters (e.g. intrinsic radii and torsion potentials) should be directly transferable to the corresponding PB models. Chen et al. recently reported an extensive optimization of the GBSW/SA implicit solvent model in CHARMM [15]. The resulting force Ô¨Åeld appears to improve the balance between solvation and intramolecular interactions and correctly predicts the secondary structure preferences and stabilities for a range of helical and beta peptides. The same force Ô¨Åeld successfully folded both b-hairpin trpzip2 and mini-protein Trp-cage to about 1.0 AÀö backbone RMSD, as illustrated in Figure 1. A GB/SA model in Amber was also carefully optimized to improve the balance of secondary structure preferences [16], following several previous modiÔ¨Åcations [17,18]. These optimizations represent important advances toward the accurate modeling of protein conformational equilibrium. It is also worth noting that they all directly beneÔ¨Åted from extensive folding and unfolding simulations of model peptides, which has only been possible with implicit solvent.
Treatment of nonpolar solvation With continual improvement in the accuracy of modeling electrostatic solvation, nonpolar solvation is becoming a critical bottleneck. Levy et al. have demonstrated that it is important to decompose the nonpolar solvation free energy further into a repulsive cavity term and an attractive solute‚Äì solvent dispersion interaction term [8]. Although the cavity term scales well with the SA, the dispersion term depends strongly on the atomic composition of the solute and only approximately tracks the surface area. The decomposition allows proper description of solvent

Both folded structures correspond to the average structures of the largest ensembles at 270 K sampled during the last 10 ns of replica-exchange (REX) folding simulations [15]. RMSD values shown were computed using all backbone heavy atoms.

Other developments of implicit solvent models The original GB formalism has also been extended and modiÔ¨Åed for specialized applications, including a residue pair-wise GB for efÔ¨Åcient rotamer placement in computational protein design [24] and an approximate GB potential suitable for Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [25]. Recently, Haberthur and CaÔ¨Çisch described a new analytical GB model named FACTS that is analogous to the pair-wise descreening approximations in nature but utilizes both the solute volume and symmetry to improve the accuracy of the effective Born radii [26]. Lazaridis introduced the Gouy‚ÄìChapman theory for modeling charged membranes, and this can be used as a supplementary term to existing implicit membrane models [6]. Advances also continue to be made in PB methodologies. Boundary element methods were developed as an alternative to the popular Ô¨Ånite difference method for computing both electrostatic potential and forces [27]. Schnieders et al. developed a polarizable multiple PB model that compares well with explicit AMOEBA water [28]. Substantial efforts continue to be made in testing and benchmarking various implicit solvent models [17,29‚Äì31]. It is also worth noting that ongoing discussions have been directed toward the optimal choice of solvent‚Äì solute boundary, a critical parameter in implicit solvent models [32,33].

screening of the solute‚Äìsolute dispersion interactions. Levy et al. further proposed a continuum van der Waals solvent model [8], and later implemented an empirical approximation for the quick estimation of the dispersion term [19]. The importance of an explicit solute‚Äìsolvent dispersion term has been conÔ¨Årmed in a study where the nonpolar mean solvation forces from explicit solvent simulations were examined [20]. Following the theoretical work of Chandler [21], Chen and Brooks illustrated several important consequences of neglecting the length-scale dependence of hydrophobic solvation in current SA-based nonpolar models [9]. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, an SA model with conformational independent surface tension coefÔ¨Åcient overstabilizes pair-wise nonpolar interactions and predicts anticooperativity instead of cooperativity in three-body hydrophobic association. The importance of length-scale dependence of hydrophobic solvation in protein conformational equilibrium was also demonstrated by microsecond time-scale MD simulations of a b-hairpin in explicit and implicit solvents [22]. McCammon and coworkers argued that electrostatic and nonpolar solvations are coupled and that one needs to solve an optimization problem to derive the most appropriate solvent boundary for both components [23]. However, it appears that current implicit solvent models have not reached the level of

Implicit solvent studies of biomolecular structure and dynamics Along with the methodological advances, implicit solvent models have enjoyed success in a range of areas, such as protein design [34], structure reÔ¨Ånement [35‚Äì38], protein‚Äìprotein, protein‚Äìnucleic acid, and protein‚Äìligand interactions [39‚Äì42]. One of the most exciting applications of efÔ¨Åcient implicit solvent models is arguably to understand protein folding and misfolding at atomic detail. Recent studies have focused on fast folding of small peptides and mini-proteins [15,16]. Folding simulations of larger and more complex proteins are emerging [18,43‚Äì46]. In addition to predicting native structures, recent studies also emphasize obtaining thermodynamics and kinetics of folding that are consistent with experiment. These efforts represent an encouraging step toward realistic modeling of biomolecular conformational equilibria. Nonetheless, it has yet to be demonstrated that a single implicit solvent force Ô¨Åeld can be consistently applied to fold a range of sequences with nontrivial folds (i.e. at least three regular secondary structure elements arranged in a nontrivial tertiary structure). This is an indication that substantial challenges (and thus opportunities) remain in deriving a balanced and transferable implicit solvent force Ô¨Åelds for the reliable simulation of protein conformational equilibrium and ab initio folding. However, recognizing that ab initio

simulation of protein folding is one of the most challenging and stringent tests of the force Ô¨Åeld and sampling technique, one should not be overly discouraged by the limited success in folding simulations conducted till date.
Implicit solvent models have also been applied to study other thermodynamic and kinetic properties of proteins. For example, MD simulations with a GB implicit solvent model were recently used to demonstrate the electrostatic basis for the stability of thermophilic proteins [47]. Hills and Brooks investigated the kinetics of the selfassociation of model amyloidogenic hexapeptides and suggested that hydrophobic cooperativity is sufÔ¨Åcient to allow for nucleation-dependent Ô¨Åbril formation [48].
Constant pH molecular dynamics A realistic representation of aqueous environment for modeling biological processes requires the consideration of solution conditions such as salt concentration and acidity (or pH). A traditional way to include solution pH effects in molecular simulations of proteins is to assign and Ô¨Åx protonation states for ionizable side chains. In the past Ô¨Åve years, signiÔ¨Åcant progress has been made in the development of methods that enable MD to be performed in equilibrium with an inÔ¨Ånite proton bath (constant pH) [4]. These methods, often referred to as constant pH MD, explicitly allow for the protein dielectric response to the correlated events of charging and conformational dynamics, and are mainly distinguished in the way by which the protonation states are modeled.
Methods based on discrete protonation states In a discrete protonation states method, also called stochastic titration MD, sampling of conformational space by MD is combined with sampling of discrete protonation states through Monte-Carlo (MC) moves. Within this scheme, different approaches have been developed, which mainly differ in the solvent representation not only for the MD and MC steps but also in the protocol for updating the protonation states. In explicit solvent MD simulations, Bu¬® rgi et al. employed short-time free energy simulation in explicit solvent to estimate the free energy of deprotonation [49] for the trial MC move, while Baptista et al. [50,63] made use of the PB electrostatics calculation. Discrete protonation states methods using implicit solvent models for both MD and MC steps have signiÔ¨Åcantly lower computational cost. Dlugosz and Antosiewicz combined PB calculation for protonation states sampling with an implicit solvent model, Analytical Continuum Electrostatics, for conformational sampling [51]. Mongan et al. developed a protocol that employs a GB model for both MC and MD samplings [52].
One potential pitfall in discrete states methods is associated with the discontinuous energy and force as a result of the abrupt switch in charge states. In explicit solvent simulations, unfavorable interactions with the solvent

may arise, thereby lowering the acceptance ratio for MC moves. This problem can be alleviated by allowing solvent to equilibrate at a Ô¨Åxed solute conformation after the change in protonation states, as demonstrated by Baptista et al. in their mixed solvent scheme [50,63]. In implicit solvent simulations, this problem is largely circumvented because of the instantaneous adjustment of solvent to the new protonation states [53]. Another strategy that may ease the problem is to change the protonation state of one site at a time, although this may slow the convergence for strongly coupled titrations [52,4]. Most recently, Stern proposed an explicit solventbased method, in which MC trial moves consist of short MD runs with a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between the old and new protonation states [53]. This method has the advantage that the trial MC moves are not instantaneous, thereby increasing the probability for acceptance in the MC steps. Also, it may offer a reduction in computational expense as compared to the method based on free energy calculations [49]. Besides the pitfall due to discontinuous energies, a discrete protonation states simulation is signiÔ¨Åcantly more expensive than a standard MD simulation, because of the extra computational time spent on the energy evaluations in the MC trial moves.
The accuracy of constant pH MD methods and their feasibility for studying pH-dependent conformational phenomena of proteins can be assessed by pKa calculations. Several methods based on discrete protonation states have been tested in pKa calculations for hen egg lysozyme [49,52,54]. The most recent results by Machuqueiro and Baptista [54] using the mixed solvent scheme are especially encouraging. The overall root-mean-square deviation between the computed and experimental pKa values is below 1 pK unit.
Methods based on continuous protonation states In the continuous protonation states approach, continuous titration coordinates are propagated simultaneously with the conformational degrees of freedom in explicit or implicit solvent MD simulations. Bo¬® rjesson and Hu¬® nenberger developed a so-called acidostat method for explicit solvent MD simulations in which the extent of deprotonation is relaxed toward the equilibrium value via a Ô¨Årst-order coupling scheme in analogy to Berendsen‚Äôs thermostat [55]. However, the theoretical basis for the equilibrium condition seems somewhat unclear [56].
Lee et al. developed a method based on l dynamics [57] and GB implicit solvent simulations, in which Ô¨Åctitious l particles are used to propagate titration degrees of freedom [58]. This method was later referred to as the CPHMD method. The end-point states of l represent the deprotonated and protonated states. To deal with simultaneous titration at two competing sites, such as the

d and e nitrogens in the histidine side chain, Khandogin and Brooks developed a two-dimensional l dynamics technique, in which a second variable, x, representing the interconversion between proton tautomers, is introduced to allow for the description of protonation processes at competing sites on an equal footing [59]. The forces on l and x coordinates are attenuated by electrostatic and van der Waals interactions involving atoms in titrating side chains. The two-dimensional l dynamics was also applied to the titration of carboxyl groups, because the exchange of the titrating oxygens is slow on a MD timescale. Realizing that Ô¨Çuctuations in protonation states depend largely on local conformational rearrangement, Khandogin and Brooks improved the convergence of protonation state sampling by making use of the replica-exchange (REX)-enhanced conformational sampling protocol [60]. The accuracy of pKa prediction using CPHMD simulations is intimately linked to the accuracy of the underlying solvent model. Overstabilization of salt bridges in the GB model has led to the systematic underestimation of pKa‚Äôs for carboxylates that interact with positively charged groups [59]. SigniÔ¨Åcant improvement was observed [60] by employing an optimized set of GB input atomic radii [15]. One remaining problem is related to the underestimation of desolvation energies of buried groups as well as buried charge‚Äìcharge interactions, which may be largely attributed to the employed dielectric boundary model that neglects solvent excluded volumes. These effects manifest themselves as pronounced deviations from experiment in the pKa calculation for buried residues [60]. Finally, Khandogin and Brooks demonstrated that, by employing a simple Debye‚ÄìHu¬® ckel screening function, salt effects on the titration property of proteins can be largely accounted for [60].
REX-CPHMD simulations using a tautomer model, an improved GB parameterization and a salt screening function, are able to offer quantitative prediction of pKa‚Äôs for proteins. In a benchmark study using 10 proteins that exhibit very large pKa shifts, the root-mean-square deviation from experiment ranges from 0.6 to 1.0 pK units [60]. The quantitative accuracy in predicting protein ionization equilibria and the additional advantage of being only marginally slower than a standard GB simulation have enabled REX-CPHMD simulations to be applied to unravel detailed mechanisms of important pH-coupled conformational processes that were previously inaccessible to theoretical studies. We will outline some of these applications in the next section.
Applications to pH-dependent conformational
phenomena An ultimate goal for the development of constant pH MD methods is to study pH-coupled conformational transitions, such as the proton-gradient-driven ATP synthesis, pH induced ion-exchange process in the integral mem-

brane, and pH-dependent protein misfolding/aggregation. Although the ability for modeling these processes is ultimately limited by the bottleneck in conformational sampling and the accuracy of force Ô¨Åeld and solvent model, emerging applications using constant pH MD have demonstrated great promise.
An important question related to the necessity for the development of constant pH simulation methodologies is the signiÔ¨Åcance of solvent‚Äìsolute proton exchange for the structure and dynamics of proteins under pH conditions such that both protonated and deprotonated states are populated. Dlugosz and Antosiewicz investigated this question using an implicit solvent stochastic titration method [61]. They showed that the distributions of Asp‚ÄìLys distance cannot be reproduced by a linear combination of those resulting from simulations with Ô¨Åxed protonation states.
The pH-dependent helicity of decalysine has been studied by Bo¬® rjesson and Hu¬® nenberger using the acidostat method in explicit solvent [62], and by Machuqueiro and Baptista using the stochastic titration method with an mixed solvent scheme [63]. In the latter study, the effect of ionic strength was included in the PB calculation for MC moves and through the reaction Ô¨Åeld parameters for the explicit solvent MD. The calculated helix proÔ¨Åle as a function of pH was compared with experiment.
The origin of the pH-dependent helicity of proteins has been a subject of many experimental investigations in the past two decades. Khandogin et al. investigated pH-dependent folding of the C-peptide from ribonuclease A, using REX-CPHMD folding simulations [64]. The study revealed not only a bell-shaped pH proÔ¨Åle for the total helix content, in agreement with experiment, but also a pH-dependent conformational equilibrium consisting of unfolded and partially folded states of various helical lengths. Furthermore, speciÔ¨Åc electrostatic interactions responsible for the helix‚Äìcoil transition were identiÔ¨Åed that are consistent with, and complementary to, the existing experimental data.
Khandogin and Brooks went on to elucidate the folding behavior of two b amyloid peptides (Ab) from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Ab (1‚Äì28) and Ab (10‚Äì42) [65]. Unlike the C-peptide and many globular proteins, which are maximally folded at an intermediate pH that minimizes the total charge, Ab is helical with an inverse bellshaped pH proÔ¨Åle in aqueous TFE solution but it is largely unfolded in water [65]. The study of Khandogin and Brooks reconciled this discrepancy by showing that Ab is mainly coil-like but contains several short, nascent helical segments that have elevated helix propensity under low and high pH conditions. Moreover, this study revealed pH-dependent solvent exposure in the central hydrophobic cluster (residues 17‚Äì21), which

found to be the result of the loss of a hydrogen-bonded network centered at H41. Thus, this work put forth a proposal that the hydrogen-bonded network and not the protonation state of H41 is a prerequisite for folding in the villin headpiece domain.

Representative conformations of the b amyloid peptide (10‚Äì42) under different pH conditions. The conformations were obtained as centroids of the most populated clusters from the REX-CPHMD folding simulations [65]. The N-terminal residues 10‚Äì28 are shown in blue; the C-terminal residues 29‚Äì42 are shown in red. In the most aggregation-prone state (pH 6), the side chains of the central hydrophobic cluster Leu-17, Val-18, Phe-19, Phe-20, and Ala-21 are shown as van der Waals spheres in pink, gray, cyan, purple, and green, respectively.

Conclusions Recent methodological advances have continued to push the level of accuracy and complexity of continuum electrostatics-based solvation theories. In particular, GB/SA theory has become a prime choice for biomolecular simulations because of the favorable balance in accuracy and efÔ¨Åciency. GB/SA-based atomistic simulations have been applied to investigate various conformational properties of biological assemblies, which cannot be directly studied using explicit solvent-based methods. It is particularly encouraging that GB/SAbased ab initio folding simulations combined with advanced conformational sampling protocols are now able to reproduce native or near-native structures for peptides and mini-proteins, and capture thermodynamics and kinetics of folding at a quantitative level. Nonetheless, substantial challenges and opportunities remain, particularly in the treatment of nonpolar solvation. As implicit solvent models are maturing for biomolecular simulations, one major goal is to achieve a force Ô¨Åeld consistent with the implicit solvent model and vice versa. The initial successes in extensive co-optimization of the GB/SA models and the protein force Ô¨Åeld, albeit limited, are very encouraging.

forms the minimum Ô¨Åbril forming sequence, and the pH-dependent b-turn formation in residues 23‚Äì26. Taken together, these data predicted that, at pH 6, Ab adopts conformational states that are most prone to the formation of b-sheet-based aggregates (Figure 2). Finally, this study suggested that, though minimum charge‚Äìcharge repulsion at the isoelectric point provides an initial driving force for aggregation, the pH modulation of the folding landscape of Ab results in an enhanced intermolecular hydrophobic association, which stabilizes b-sheet-based oligomers.
Khandogin et al. also explored the formation of folding intermediate states involving ionizable side chains [66]. REX-CPHMD simulations initiated from an X-ray crystal and a minimized average solution NMR structure of the villin headpiece domain gave rise to two conformational states that display distinct titration behavior for a histidine residue (H41), similar to the measurements for the native and intermediate states, respectively. Supported by the dynamical, structural, and titration properties, the simulation data suggested that the state derived from the solution NMR structure resembles a putative intermediate that has a largely unfolded N-terminal subdomain. Moreover, the formation of the putative intermediate was

The advancement in implicit solvent models has also facilitated the development of constant pH MD methods. Of particular interest are the stochastic titration method that combines PB calculations for protonation states sampling and explicit solvent MD for conformational sampling and the CPHMD method based on l dynamics and GB/SA models. The accuracy of the CPHMD method will beneÔ¨Åt signiÔ¨Åcantly from further improvement of the underlying GB models and a more rigorous treatment of salt screening effects. The CPHMD method can be combined with other implicit solvent models such as PB. However, since PB requires numerical solutions, the potential of mean force for the protonation of model compound is no longer analytical and has to be approximated by a continuous function. In principle, the CPHMD formalism can be extended to explicit solvent simulations, though, with the current CPU and sampling capability, convergence properties are expected to be poor. Another effect that may play a signiÔ¨Åcant role is electronic polarization. In this regard, one avenue is to employ a polarizable force Ô¨Åeld.
Emerging applications of constant pH MD have mainly focused on Ô¨Årst principles pKa predictions and pHcoupled conformational dynamics. The accuracy and speed of the REX-CPHMD simulation have enabled

novel insights into the pH-modulated peptide folding, formation of intermediates, and the aggregation behavior of amyloidogenic peptides. Ongoing studies (JK, CLB, unpublished data) indicate that the REX-CPHMD technique can be applied to investigate many other pH-dependent conformational phenomena, such as the pHdependent folding at the membrane interface, electrostatic interactions in the unfolded states, and backbone registry shifts in amyloid Ô¨Åbrils. The detailed insights gained from these and other studies greatly complement and extend the information accessible by experimental techniques, making implicit solvent-based molecular simulation a powerful tool for exploring unanswered questions related to mechanisms that govern a wide variety of biological processes.
