The hsp70, or stress-70, molecular chaperones perform numerous functions that include stabilizing newly synthesized or unfolding polypeptides, facilitatingtranslocation of nascent chains across membranes, mediatingassembly or disassembly of multimeric protein complexes, and targeting of proteins for degradation within lysosomes (reviewed by Gething and Sambrook (1992)M, cKay (1993), and Becker and Craig(1994)). These functions require thatchaperone proteins recognize and bind toa wide variety of target proteins that shareno obvious sequence similarity, and that they areable to distinguish native from unfolded proteins.
Although hsp7O proteins have been highly conserved evolutionarily(Bardwell and Craig,1984; Huntand Morimoto, 1985), they arenot functionally interchangeable. For example, neither theendoplasmic reticulum hsp7O protein, BiP, nor the bacterial hsp7O protein, DnaK,can substitutefor hsc70 in binding to peptidesequences that target proteins for lysosomal degradation (Terlecky et al., 1992) or in facilitating in uitro translocation of proteins into mammalian microsomes (Wiech

acids and exposed a motif best described as Hy(W/X)HyXHyXHy, where Hy is a large hydrophobic or aromatic amino acid,(most frequentlyTrp, Leu,or Phe), W is Trp, a n d X is any amino acid. The content of charged residues, and particularly lysine, was significantly reduced in BiP-binding peptides. Using a similar approach with DnaK, Gragerov et al. (1994) selectedbacteriophagesdisplayinghexapeptides that also containedhydrophobic amino acids. However, their results indicated that theinclusion of a basic aminoacid was beneficial for binding by DnaK, while the presence of acidic residues did not favor binding. Finally, hsc70-selected bacteriophages displayed peptides thatfrequently contained 2 4 basicamino acids, predominantly lysines (Hightower et al., 1994). To directly compare the peptide binding specificities of three different hsp70family members,we have now screened more than 50 peptides for binding to Escherichia coli DnaK, bovine liver BiP, and bovine brain hsc70, using a simple invitro assay involving competition by peptides of complex formationbetween the hsp7O proteins and a model unfolded protein, reduced and carboxymethylated lactalbumin (Palleros et al., 1991).Our studies

Binding of peptideP17Gto hsc70 caused a shift to higher mobility on non-denaturing PAGE (Lam & Calderwood, 1992, A.M. Fourie,
unpublished results), making discrimination difficult between the species corresponding to the hsc7O-RCMLA complex and P17G-bound hsc7O.
P17G was designated as intermediate affinity (+) for hsc7O on the basisof assays of direct binding of biotinylated P17G (apparent & of 200 p) and competition of binding of biotinylated T6L peptide (kpbpetween 100 and 500 p).
Peptide A is designatednegative for BiP binding becauseat 500 p,only 5 to 10% competition of BiP-RCMLAcomplex formation wasobserved
in two separate experiments.However, from the resultsof other assays(competition of binding of biotinylated T6L and ATPase stimulation, data
not shown) this peptide would be rated as having low (e)affinity for BiP (kp, between 500 p and 1mM).

Technologies. BiP was purified from bovine liver microsomes using a n ATP-agarose column (Flynn et al., 1989). Reduced and carboxymethylated lactalbumin (RCMLA)’ was obtained from Sigma.
Peptides-Peptides (whose sequences are shown in Table I) were synthesized by continuous flow solid-phase synthesis using fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl- or tert-butyloxycarbonyl-protected amino acids and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Peptides pp9, pp32, pp38, and pp48 correspond to sequences displayed by BiP-binding bacteriophages (BlondElguindi et al., 1993a),while np09 and np5w3 ere non-binding peptides identified in the samestudy. PepA, PepG, and PepI correspond to peptides described previously by Flynn et al. (1989). Peptides P17G (Lam and Caldenvood, 1992), P6S, T6L, K6G, S16D, SlOS, and S2V10 were synthesized specifically for our studies and correspond t o sequences present inwild-type and mutantp53 proteins (Caron deFromentel and Soussi, 19921,while peptides V10 and W T V l O were generously supplied by Dr. David Carbone (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Peptides HbS (catalog no. V5130), A6R (no. A8651), G6R (no. G1391), PlOK (no. P5307), and Y6V (no. T8156) were obtained from Sigma. The remaining peptides were synthesized in the Biopolymers

Competition by Peptides of Complex Formation between hsp70 and RCMLA-A competition binding assay thatcompares the ability of synthetic peptides t o bind to differenthsp70 molecules was developed based on observations (Palleros et al., 1991; Langer et al., 1992; Cyr et al.,1992)that hsc70 and DnaK bindto an unfolded form of lactalbumin (RCMLA). hsp70 proteins (2 pgof hsc70 (2.8 1.1~final concentration) or 1pg of DnaK or BiP (1.4 PM) per assay) were incubated with 40 p RCMLA, in the absence or presence of 500 1.1~competing peptide at 37 “C for 2 h in buffer A (25 mM Tris-HC1,20 mM Hepes, pH 7.15, containing 47.5 mM KC1 and 2.25 m~ Mg(0Ac)J. Free hsp7O (or similarly migrating hsp7O-peptide complexes) and free RCMLA were separated from hsp7O-RCMLAcomplexes by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (resolving gel: 6% acrylamide, 0.4 M Tris-HC1, pH 8.8; stacking gel: 4.5% acrylamide, 0.12 M Tris-HC1, pH 6.8; running buffer: 25 mM Tris, 192 nw glycine, pH 8.3) and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The percentage ofhsp7O molecules that were not complexed to RCMLA was estimated by visual inspection and quantitatedby densitometric scanning of the bandscorresponding to the free hsp7O molecules (orhsp70-peptide complexes) andthe hsp7O-RCMLA complexes.

The hsp7O proteins hsc70 (A, 2 pg/ assay, 2.8 p~ final concentration), BiP( B , 1pg/assay, 1.4 p~ final concentration), and DnaK (C, 1 pg/assay, 1.4 pr.1 final concentration) were incubated with 40 p~ RCMLA ( L A )for 2 h a t 37 “C in buffer A in the absence or presence of 500 p~ competing peptide (see “Experimental Procedures”).

I t should be noted that the different hsp70-RCMLA complexes migrate with similar electrophoretic mobilities. However, becausefree hsc70 migrates more slowly than either DnaK or BiP, the electrophoretic mobility of the DnaK- or BiP-RCMLA complex is lower than that of the free chaperoneor chaperone-peptide complex (panelsA and B ), while the reverse is truefor hsc7O (panel C). The asterisk marks tphoesition of a lactalbumin specieosr contaminant present in theRCMLA preparation.

(lane 4 ) and bnos (lane 51,the majority of each hsp7O protein was in complex with RCMLA, indicating that these peptides bound with low affinity. The peptide EGFR (lane 6 )is considered to have intermediate affinity for hsc7O and DnaK, as approximately 50% of each of these proteins wascomplexed with RCMLA. BiP bound this peptide withhigher affinity than hsc7O or DnaK, a s BiP-RCMLA complexes represented only approximately 30% of the total population of BiP molecules.
Peptide binding to the C-terminadl omain of hsp70 proteins can stimulate theATPase activityof the molecule (Flynn et al., 1989). This stimulation may reflect peptide-induced dissociation of hsp70 oligomers into moreactivespecies (BlondElguindi et al., 1993b) and/or result directly from an induced conformational change in the N-terminaAl TPase domain (DeLuca-Flaherty et al.1,990;Park et al., 1993).The concentration dependence of peptide binding (as measured by the RCMLA competition assay) andof peptide-dependent ATPase stimulation was measured for peptide V10 and 3 additional peptides, P6S, PlOK, and S16D. Peptide binding(Fig. 2, column A ) correlated well with stimulationofATPase activity (Fig.2, column B 1, particularly in thecase of DnaK. Peptide P6Sshowed negligible binding to all of the hsp7O proteins and no significant stimulation of their ATPase activities, even at millimolar concentrations.

RESULTS

Substitution of the lysine in position 2 by leucine increased the affinity of peptide S7-K2L for all three proteins, with the effect being most striking with BiP. Substitution of tyrosine a t position 2 to yield peptide S7-K2Y had a dramatic effect on binding to all three proteins, essentially abolishing the specificity differences ob-

served for peptide S7. This substitutionincreased the affinity of

the heptapeptideapproximately 5- and 20-fold, respectively, for

DnaK and hsc70 (to Kapp-50 V M in each case), and converted

the peptide from one that displayed negligible binding to BiP to

one that bound with an apparent affinity of -80 p~ (Fig. 6,

yielded a peptide (S7-K1F, K2Y) that hadlower affinity for the

the lysine in position 2 of the S7 heptapeptide plays a major

1984; Hunt and Morimoto, 19851, individual members display significant functional diversity (Gao aelt., 1991;Terlecky et al., 1992; Wiech et al., 1993; Brodsky et al., 1993) that may be related to variations in the(po1y)peptiderecognition patterns of the family members. We developed an invitro assay to compare the peptide binding specificities of three members of this family (DnaK, BiP, and hsc70), as a model for their interaction with exposed regions of newly synthesized or denatured proteins. Discrimination by thisassay betweenpeptides that bound with high, low, or negligible affinities correlated with results for peptide-induced stimulation of the ATPase activities of the hsp70 proteins, although insome cases binding could be detected a t peptide concentrations lower than those required for ATPase stimulation. Using the assay tsocreen 36 synthetic peptides (and an additional 17 variants of two of these peptides), we identified features that were beneficial or unfavorable for binding to all threhesp7O proteins. In general,peptides that bound with high affinity contained a stretch of a t least 7 amino acids that was enriched in large hydrophobic and aromatic residues. Basic amino acids were usually well tolerated, particularly by DnaK and hsc70, while the presence of acidic residues was generally unfavorable for binding. Peptides that showed negligible affinity for any of the three proteins either lacked large hydrophobic and aromatic residues or were enriched in acidic residues. These results are in agreemenwt ith t h e findings of previous studies of the individual hsp7O proteins (Flynnet al., 1991;Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a; Gragerovet al., 1994; Hightower et al., 1994). In particular, the relativaeffinities of the peptides for BiPcorrelated well with the scores generated from their sequences using theBiP Score algorithm, a program designed to predict BiP-binding sites in synthetic peptides and naturallyoccurring polypeptides (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a).
The majority of the peptides that we studied bound to the three hsp7O proteins with significantly different affinities, but no two of the proteins appeared to be consistently more alike than the third in their peptide binding specificity. To better understand features that determine tchoemmon and divergent

peptide bindingspecificities of the hsp7O proteins, the effects of amino acid substitutions at various positions withinheptameric peptides were investigated.The analysisof peptide V7 showed that the amino acids in positions 2, 4, and 6 had a significant influence on the affinity of the peptide for all three chaperones. Of all the heptamers studiedV, 7-K6L, which contains aromatic or large hydrophobic residues in all three of these positions, had the highesatffinity for the hsp70 proteins. The influence of these positions on binding of the V7 peptides is consistent with our previous findings (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a) that residues present in alternating positions are important for binding of peptides to BiP. In some cases the amino acid substitutions affected the binding of the peptide t o all three chaperones to similar extents, while in others (notably substitutions of charged residues a t positions 2 and 6) the three proteins were differentiallyaffected. The analysisof peptide S7 also suggested that specificity divergence between the chaperones may frequently be determined by the differing extents to which theytolerate polar and chargedaminoacids in position 2.
In general our observations are consistent with a model for peptide binding by hsp7O proteins similar to that proposed for MHC Class I1 molecules, whose binding cleft contains one deep pocket lined with nonpolar residues that islikely to accommodate a dominant anchoresidue of the bound peptide, as well as three otherpockets likely to bind the side chains of a secondary anchor residue and two allele-specific residues (Brown et al., 1993; Hammer et al., 1993). The models would, however, differ in detail since the anchor residue(s)recognized by the hsp7O proteins isnot limitedto being a single aminaocid as is thcease with Class I1 molecules, but is rather permittedto be one of a class (i.e. residues with bulky hydrophobic or aromaticside chains). This greaterpermissiveness almost certainly underlies the ability of hsp7Ochaperones to recognize a greater variety of sequences than is the case for MHC molecules. The observed pattern of overall similarity butspecific variations in thepeptide recognition patterns of hsp70 proteins could result from the family members differing in having one or more amino acid

The chaperone functions of hsp7O proteins are regulated and perhaps targeted to different cellular locations by members of the extensive DnaJ-like protein family (reviewed by Cyr et al. (1994)). Different hsp70DnaJ-like protein pairs appear to be specifically adapted t o each other (Cyr and Douglas, 1994). Studies of bacteriophage transcription in E. coli (reviewed by Georgopoulos (1992)) identifieda second co-chaperone, GrpE, which binds directly to an exposed loopon the ATPase domain of DnaK (Buchberger et al., 1994). Additional members of a GrpE-likeprotein family have recently beenidentified in organelles of eukaryotic cells (Bolliger et al., 1994; Stuartet al., 1994),raising thepossibility that hsp70/GrpE-like protein pairs may also be specifically adapted to each other.
