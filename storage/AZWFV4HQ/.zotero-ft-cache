ABSTRACT: A set of improved parameters for the AMOEBA polarizable atomic multipole water model is developed. An automated procedure, ForceBalance, is used to adjust model parameters to enforce agreement with ab initio-derived results for water clusters and experimental data for a variety of liquid phase properties across a broad temperature range. The values reported here for the new AMOEBA14 water model represent a substantial improvement over the previous AMOEBA03 model. The AMOEBA14 model accurately predicts the temperature of maximum density and qualitatively matches the experimental density curve across temperatures from 249 to 373 K. Excellent agreement is observed for the AMOEBA14 model in comparison to experimental properties as a function of temperature, including the second virial coeﬃcient, enthalpy of vaporization, isothermal compressibility, thermal expansion coeﬃcient, and dielectric constant. The viscosity, selfdiﬀusion constant, and surface tension are also well reproduced. In comparison to high-level ab initio results for clusters of 2−20 water molecules, the AMOEBA14 model yields results similar to AMOEBA03 and the direct polarization iAMOEBA models. With advances in computing power, calibration data, and optimization techniques, we recommend the use of the AMOEBA14 water model for future studies employing a polarizable water model.

■ INTRODUCTION “What does a ﬁsh know about the water in which he swims all his life?” ∼Albert Einstein (“Self Portrait”, 1936) “Water is the most extraordinary substance! Practically all its properties are anomalous...” ∼Albert Szent-Georgi (“The Living State”, 1972)
Empirical models of water play an important role in the
prediction and rationalization of bulk water properties. One of the ﬁrst water models was proposed by Bernal and Fowler in 1933.1 Before the advent of digital computers, this simple
atomistic model was used to deduce the crystal structure of ice, the X-ray diﬀraction curve for water, and the heat of solution of ions. Water was among the ﬁrst molecular systems to be simulated at the atomic level via Monte Carlo2 and molecular dynamics (MD) techniques.3 The ST2 water model, used
throughout much of the early computational work, showed
simple distributed point charge models could be tailored to reproduce bulk properties.4 Elaboration of ﬁxed point charge models led to the development of the widely used TIP3P,2 TIP4P,2 and SPC5 potentials, as well as the subsequent ST4,6 TIP5P,7 SPC/E,8 TIP4P-Ew,9 and F3C10 potentials, among
many others. All of these water models have been used as the foundation for development of various biomolecular force ﬁelds;
therefore, many of the models are still commonly used for explicit
solvent calculations on biological systems.
A tremendous variety of specialized water potentials have been
proposed for accurate modeling of molecular cluster data and

selected bulk properties. These specialized potentials are typically parametrized and calibrated against accurate and reliable ab initio results for small numbers of molecules and include an explicit accounting of electronic polarization. Perhaps the ﬁrst pair-interaction water model to be systematically constructed from ab initio data was the original MCY model from 1976.11 Early attempts at polarizable models include Vesely’s work with Stockmayer potentials12 and the polarizable electropole model of Barnes et al.13 Kuwajima and Warshel later incorporated explicit polarization into a modiﬁed potential inspired by the MCY work.14 Other early polarizable potentials were provided by Sprik and Klein,15 the NEMO method,16 the POL3 model from Kollman’s group,17 and Dykstra’s MMC model.18 While a complete list is far too long to present here, more recent members extending this class would include TTM3F,19 SWM4-DP,20 DPP2,21 etc. Key features of such water models include the ability to reproduce with high ﬁdelity the electrostatic potential around an isolated water molecule, and the ability of individual molecules to respond to their local environment. Some water potentials, such as TTM3, couple

the electrostatic representation to the structure of the molecule as speciﬁed by valence terms.
Much of chemistry can be rationalized at the level of partial
charge interactions based on electronegativity arguments and inductive eﬀects. To yield an accurate representation of an electrostatic potential usually requires a molecular description beyond simple partial atomic charges.22 While atom-centered charge ﬁtting schemes such as RESP23 are extensively employed to parametrize force ﬁelds, the typical result is a relative error of several percent over an envelope close to, but outside of, the van
der Waals surface of a polar molecule. One solution to improve
upon the partial atomic charge water models is to include
polarizability, as in the atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications (AMOEBA) force ﬁeld. The advan-
tages of a polarizable model are evident in heterogeneous systems, for example, water−ion mixtures. Both cations and
anions are highly polarizing, and the larger anions in particular are also very polarizable. While it is certainly possible for nonpolarizable force ﬁelds to provide reasonable bulk phase structural and thermodynamic properties,24 a fully polarizable
model should have an advantage in terms of transferability. Ion parameters derived against gas phase ion−water ab initio calculations adapt seamlessly to condensed phase modeling.25
While the AMOEBA model goes beyond typical ﬁxed-charge
empirical potentials via inclusion of higher order permanent
multipoles and dipole polarizability, it neglects quantum nuclear

eﬀects (QNEs) such as zero-point energy. In keeping with the traditional formulation of molecular mechanics force ﬁelds, AMOEBA is an attempt to reproduce the Born−Oppenheimer potential energy surface (BO-PES) in terms of simple classical potential functions. As such, AMOEBA results can be directly compared to and parametrized against a corresponding BO-PES derived from ab initio electronic structure calculations. The issues surrounding QNE arise when AMOEBA is used to model dynamic properties at ﬁnite temperature, as in MD simulations aimed at modeling properties of water in the bulk phase. One approach is to explicitly include QNE in the calculations by performing path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD),26 or a recent variant such as ring-polymer (RPMD) simulations.27 Several path-integral-based studies of liquid water structure and properties have been reported over the past three decades.28−36 As has been noted,26 these simulations do not reproduce the dynamics of the real quantum system but provide an isomorphic system in which QNE-corrected properties can be evaluated.
Provided the QNE are reasonably small for properties and temperatures of interest, a second possibility is to implicitly account for such eﬀects in the model parametrization while evaluating properties via classical MD methods. This approach is perhaps best viewed as a parameter renormalization to account for the approximate nature of the classical simulations.32 For properties where the quantum corrections are larger, estimates of the correction are often well-known and can be added to the

classical result prior to comparison with experiment.37 As will be
discussed below, we have chosen to implicitly include quantum nuclear eﬀects in AMOEBA. Retaining the use of classical
simulation technology for use with AMOEBA has two advantages: (1) increased computational eﬃciency and ease of
parametrization and (2) compatibility with existing AMOEBA
parameters developed for a variety of systems including ions,
small organic molecules, transition metal complexes, proteins,
and nucleic acids. The choice of water potential is often a key ﬁrst step in
construction of a general-purpose molecular force ﬁeld. Water is a ubiquitous solvent, and the balance of solvent−solvent, solvent−solute, and solute−solute interactions often plays a
critical role in determining solute behavior. Computation of
relative hydration free energies and ligand binding energies is aided by cancellation of errors in force ﬁeld models. However,
accurate calculation of absolute free energies generally requires a ﬁne balance between solvent and solute interactions. Errors in the solvent−solvent potential will systematically recur in all
subsequent calculations involving solvent. This explains the fact that the most current biomolecular force ﬁelds are explicitly or
implicitly parametrized for use with a particular water model. For example, recent revision of the Amber nonpolarizable force ﬁeld
for use with the TIP4P-Ew water model involved a substantial reworking of the protein parameter values38 or the elimination of the simple mixing rules to combine these force ﬁelds by explicitly parametrizing for the solute−solvent interactions themselves.39
Fitting of model parameters can be carried out manually via a
trial and error method, or an automated procedure can be employed. Least squares optimization of force ﬁelds ﬁrst began with the consistent force ﬁeld proposed by Lifson and Warshel in the 1960s.40 Other early eﬀorts extended least-squares optimization through use of ab initio calculations41 and application to bulk phase crystal modeling.42 Recently, force
matching techniques have played a major role in development of both atomistic and coarse grained models.43−45 ForceBalance46−48 (Figure 1) extends this prior work in several
directions, including the ability to use a larger and more diverse
data set which includes experimental liquid phase measurements
and ab initio calculations. The overall objective function is
expressed as a weighted sum of squared residuals over the
experimental and theoretical target data sets. Recently, ForceBalance has been used to derive two new, rigid, ﬁxed partial charge water models, TIP3P-FB and TIP4P-FB.48
In the present work, we derive a revised set of parameters for
the AMOEBA water model using the ForceBalance method-
ology. The new model, to be referred to as AMOEBA14, represents a signiﬁcant improvement over the original 2003 AMOEBA water parametrization49 (herein referred to as AMOEBA03). The AMOEBA14 model provides a signiﬁcant
improvement in the ability to predict experimental and ab initio
data, particularly for a number of liquid properties across a range
of temperatures. In addition, we provide some initial results to
show the new model is capable of yielding acceptable results of ion−water energetics, which holds promise of compatibility of
AMOEBA14 water with the previously determined AMOEBA force ﬁelds for organic molecules50 and for proteins.51
■ METHODOLOGY AMOEBA Model. The atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications (AMOEBA)49 water model
in this work has the functional form

E = Ebond + Eangle + Ebθ + EvdW + Eepleerm + Eeinled

(1)

The ﬁrst three terms describe the short-range interactions, including bond stretching, angle bending, and the Urey−Bradley bond-angle cross term. The bond stretching parameters include anharmonicity up to second order deviations from the ideal bond length

Ebond = Kb(b − b0)2[1 − 2.55(b − b0)

− 3.793125(b − b0)2]

(2)

and the angle bending function includes up to fourth order deviations from the ideal angle

Eangle = Kθ(θ − θ0)2[1 − 0.014(θ − θ0) + (5.6 × 10−5)

(θ − θ0)2 − (7.0 × 10−7)(θ − θ0)3

+ (2.2 × 10−8)(θ − θ0)4]

(3)

The Urey−Bradley parameters follow a harmonic functional form

UUB = KS(S − S0)2

(4)

The remaining three terms in eq 1 describe the nonbonded van der Waals (vdW) interactions and the electrostatic contributions from both permanent and induced dipoles. The vdW term follows a Halgren buﬀered 14-7 potential to model the pairwise additive interactions for dispersion at long-range and exchange repulsion at short-range52

and which is less steep than the Lennard-Jones functional form. The nonbonded van der Waals (vdW) parameters we use are n = 14, m = 7, δ = 0.07, γ = 0.12, the well depth εij, and ρij = (Rij/Ri0j), where Rij is the i−j separation and Ri0j is the minimum energy distance. van der Waals parameters are included for both oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen reduction factor moves the hydrogen vdW center toward the oxygen along the bond length. For example, a reduction factor of 0.80 would move the hydrogen vdW center 20% of the bond length toward the oxygen.
The permanent electrostatic term includes the atomic monopole, dipole, and quadrupole moments for each atom center. The polarization eﬀects within the AMOEBA water model include mutual polarization by mutual induction of the dipoles for each atom. The nonadditive deﬁnition of the model translates to each atom within the water molecule being a polarizable site and experiencing the mutual polarization. As a consequence of the nonadditive mutual deﬁnition of the AMOEBA model, a polarization catastrophe would arise if a
damping scheme were not introduced; therefore, the polarization parameters for the AMOEBA water model include the polarizability of oxygen and hydrogen and a damping factor related to Thole’s description of damping.53 The distribution of the charge (ρ) in AMOEBA has the functional form

ρ = 3α exp(−au3)

4π

where a represents the damping parameter53 controlling how strongly the charge distribution is smeared and u is the distance relating the polarizabilities of atomic sites i and j [u = Rij/ (αiαj)1/6].

For the mutual model, the induced dipole is calculated at each atomic site via

∑ ∑ μii,nαduc = αiEi,α = αi( TαijMj +

Tαijβ′ μji′n,dβuc)

{j}

{j}

with α, β = 1, 2, 3

(7)

where αi is the atom polarizability, Ei,αa represents the electric ﬁelds generated by permanent multipoles and induced dipoles, Mj = [qj, μj1, μj2, μj3, ...]T includes the permanent multipole components, and Tαij = [Tα, Tα1, Tα2, Tα3, ...] represents the matrix for the interaction of sites i and j, where Tα = ∇αT = −(Rα/R3) and Tαβ = ∇αTβ. The summations are carried out over two sets: {j}, all atom sites outside the molecule containing atom site i, and {j′}, all atom sites other than i. The function for the induced
dipoles self-consistently reduces to

∑ μii,nαduc(n + 1) = μii,nαduc(n) + αi( Tαijβ′ μji′n,dβuc(n))
{j}

with n = 0, 1, 2, ...

(8)

From this solution, the ﬁrst term in eq 8 represents the direct induced dipole for atom i as a result of the electric ﬁeld generated from the permanent multipoles from neighboring molecules. The second term represents the mutual induced dipole resulting from induced dipoles induced on all other atom sites. The mutual induction calculation is iterated until the induced dipoles are no longer induced by dipoles on all other sites with a tolerance set to 10−5 D.
For the reparameterization of the AMOEBA functional form, there were 21 tunable parameters included in the optimization: the vdW radius (R) and potential well depth (ε) for oxygen and
hydrogen, reduction factor for hydrogen, bond-stretching force constant (Kb) and length (b), angle-bending force constant (Kθ) and magnitude (θ), Urey−Bradley force constant (KS) and length (S), charge for hydrogen and oxygen, multipoles (dipole, quadrupole) for hydrogen and oxygen, polarizability for hydrogen and oxygen, and Thole polarization damping factor.
Simulation Protocol. Initial cycles of ForceBalance used a cubic box with an initial side length of 18.65 Å and containing 216 water molecules. Molecular dynamics in the NPT ensemble was performed via a Martyna−Tuckerman−Klein integrator incorporating a Nose−́ Hoover thermostat and barostat.54 Final liquid parameter optimization cycles were also done on 216 waters. Each ﬁnal simulation was run for 4 ns following 400 ps of equilibration. The simulations for the ﬁnal parametrization employed Langevin dynamics with a multiple time step velocity Verlet integrator with the Langevin friction force and random force. The Langevin dynamics used a friction coeﬃcient of 1.0 ps−1. These ﬁnal simulations used a Monte Carlo barostat with a trial frequency of 1 box size change per 25 MD steps. All dynamics simulations were performed with either the TINKER55 or OpenMM56 modeling software packages. Properties, including the self-diﬀusion constant, viscosity, dielectric constant, enthalpy of vaporization, heat capacity, isothermal compressibility, and second virial coeﬃcient, were computed by
the same methods used for the earlier AMOEBA03 water model.49
Calibration Data. The data utilized for ﬁtting the parameters was composed of a combination of experimentally determined condensed phase properties as well as robust ab initio-derived properties. The condensed phase properties considered were the density, enthalpy of vaporization, isothermal compressibility,

isobaric heat capacity, thermal expansion coeﬃcient, and dielectric constant. The temperature and pressure combinations were 1 atm at temperatures ranging from 249 to 373 K (32 total) and 298 K at pressures from 1 to 8 kbar (8 total). The complete lists of temperatures, pressures, and values for each experimental property are included in the Supporting Information.
The ab initio reference data included properties for systems ranging in size from the monomer to clusters of 22 water molecules. For the monomer, the charge, dipole, quadrupoles, polarizability, vibrations, and geometry were considered. The ab initio interaction energies and ground state geometries for the ground state dimer, Smith dimer set (10 total),57 trimer, tetramer, pentamer, eight hexamers,58 two octamers,59 ﬁve 11mers,60 ﬁve 16-mers, two 17-mers, and four 20-mers61,62 were utilized for calibration. In previous work,63 over 42 000 cluster (ranging from 2 to 22 water molecules) geometries were obtained from AMOEBA simulations of liquid water for temperatures ranging from 249 to 373 K. Energies and gradients for the clusters were determined via RI-MP264,65/heavy-aug-ccpVTZ66 as implemented in Q-Chem 4.0.67 This large compilation of theoretical data was included in the ﬁtting of the AMOEBA water parameters.
ForceBalance. The AMOEBA03 water model was parametrized by hand to ﬁt results from ab initio calculations on gas phase clusters,49 and temperature and pressure dependent bulk phase properties.68 Here we apply ForceBalance, an automatic optimization method, to parametrize a revised AMOEBA14 model using the expanded data set described in the last section. ForceBalance has previously been applied to the development of a direct polarization variant of AMOEBA, labeled iAMOEBA, which omits the self-consistent calculation of polarization interactions.63 One of the goals for iAMOEBA was to accurately describe bulk phase properties; therefore, the condensed phase properties, e.g., density, were given a greater weight than gas phase properties, such as cluster interaction energies. Ideally, the mutual AMOEBA model should be applicable across all system sizes and phases as well. To reﬂect this goal for the mutual polarization model, each property in the calibration set was initially given an equal weight. This is in contrast to the previous direct polarization water model, where the condensed phase experimental data was weighted more heavily than the gas phase cluster data.
The enthalpy of vaporization measures the water−water interaction strength, while the related property of the density reﬂects the hydrogen-bonded network structure, both of which have signiﬁcant temperature (and pressure) dependence. If the enthalpy value is too large or its change with temperature is too steep, then the attraction between the water molecules is too great and the heat capacity would be too high. This would be problematic for not only the homogeneous water system but also in heterogeneous systems where the water−water, water−solute, and solute−solute interactions need to be balanced. For example, a temperature of maximum density (TMD) of a model that is very diﬀerent than the experimental TMD would likely change the trends in hydrophobic hydration with temperature, since the entropic penalty for cavity formation in the liquid by deﬁnition changes with temperature. Therefore, the weighting of the condensed phase properties was adjusted to increase the weights of the enthalpy of vaporization and density in relation to the other condensed phase properties. The whole set of condensed phase properties maintained equal weighting with the gas phase data, but the individual condensed phase properties were assigned diﬀerent weights with respect to each other.

ForceBalance supports many diﬀerent optimization algo-
rithms, and the calculation in this work was carried out using the trust-radius Newton−Raphson (or Levenberg−Marquardt69,70) algorithm with an adaptive trust radius.71,72 This algorithm requires the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the objective function in the parameter space, which we derive from the ﬁrst derivatives of the simulated properties using the Gauss−Newton approx-
imation. A major challenge in force ﬁeld parametrization is the
signiﬁcant statistical noise in the objective function from the
sampling of properties to be matched to experiment. The
parametric derivatives are challenging to evaluate because numerical diﬀerentiation requires running multiple simulations and evaluating small diﬀerences between statistically noisy estimates. ForceBalance uses thermodynamic ﬂuctuation for-
mulas to calculate accurate parametric derivatives of simulated properties without running expensive multiple simulations.47,73
For instance, the ensemble average of a generic observable A that does not depend explicitly on the force ﬁeld parameters (for
example, the density or an order parameter) can be expressed as
follows

∫ ⟨A⟩λ

=

1 Q (λ)

A(r, V ) exp(−β(E(r, V ; λ) + PV )) dr dV

∫ Q (λ) = exp(−β(E(r, V ; λ) + PV )) dr dV

(9)
where A is the observable, r a given molecular conﬁguration in a periodic simulation cell, λ the force ﬁeld parameter, E the potential energy, β ≡ (kBT)−1 the inverse temperature, kB the

Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, P the pressure, V the volume, and Q the isothermal−isobaric partition function and the angle brackets with a λ subscript represent an ensemble average in the thermodynamic ensemble of the force ﬁeld parametrized by λ. In practice, this integral is evaluated
numerically using molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo
simulation in the NPT ensemble. Since the expression for A depends on λ only through the
potential energy E, we can diﬀerentiate eq 9 analytically:

The potential energy derivative ⟨dE/dλ⟩ is evaluated by numerically diﬀerentiating the potential energies at the sampled structures. Equation 10 provides a way to evaluate the parametric derivative of thermodynamic properties without running additional sampling simulations, though the derivative of any observable always manifests as a higher order correlation function and has a larger statistical error than the observable itself. This equation may be directly applied to obtain derivatives of ensemble-averaged observables with implicit parametric dependence through the thermodynamic ensemble, such as the

density ρ. Equation 10 is easily extensible to obtain derivatives of observables with explicit parameter dependence, such as the enthalpy; derivatives for higher-order thermodynamic response properties such as the dielectric constant are obtained using the chain rule.63 We omit the calculation of second parametric derivatives for reasons of computational cost and statistical noise, relying instead on the least-squares form of the objective function and the Gauss−Newton approximation to obtain the Hessian.
In order to maximize the eﬃciency of simulating properties, ForceBalance interfaces with several powerful and complementary technologies. ForceBalance includes interfaces to AMOEBA via the TINKER55 modeling software and via OpenMM 6.1,56 a graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated MD engine. The Work Queue library74 allows ForceBalance to parallelize multiple simulations across compute nodes in diﬀerent physical locations. ForceBalance analyzes the data from ﬁnished simulations using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR)75 which allows multiple simulations at diﬀerent thermodynamic phase points to statistically contribute to one another. All of these software packages and methods are freely available on the Web.
The problem of overﬁtting is treated by regularization via a penalty function, which corresponds to imposing a prior distribution of parameter probabilities in a Bayesian interpretation. The prior widths reﬂect the expected variations of the parameters during the optimization, which may be chosen heuristically or sampled over in an empirical Bayes approach. Our optimization was regularized using a Gaussian prior speciﬁed in Table 1, corresponding to a parabolic penalty function in parameter space centered at the original AMOEBA parameter values with the chosen force constants. Since the various parameters have diﬀerent physical meanings (e.g., vdW well depth, O−H bond length), each parameter type was assigned its own prior width.
We ran the optimization until ﬂuctuations from numerical noise prevented further improvement. The calculation converged to within the statistical error after about 10 nonlinear iterations, though we performed several optimizations with diﬀerent choices of weights for the reference data and prior widths before arriving at the ﬁnal answer.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION AMOEBA14 Water Parameters. The parameters for the new AMOEBA14 water model, the AMOEBA03 model, and the Gaussian prior widths included in the ForceBalance optimization are reported in Table 1. The prior widths are proportional to the inverse-squared strength of the harmonic penalty for each parameter and reﬂect the parameter’s intrinsic size and expected variability. It should be noted that the bond force constant, angle force constant, and Urey−Bradley parameters for AMOEBA03 were modiﬁed in 2013 when it was observed that the original parameters incorrectly predicted the order of the vibrational frequencies; therefore, the comparison we are making for intramolecular parameters is to those revised parameters. Table 1 shows that the intramolecular parameters for the AMOEBA model remained essentially unchanged from 2003 to 2014.
The damping value of 0.39 was kept ﬁxed during the
AMOEBA14 model optimization, since the value in the 2003 model was set based on water cluster energies, and this damping value has been tested and employed for the majority of atom classes within the AMOEBA model. For the AMOEBA03 water model, the polarizability parameters for oxygen and hydrogen were those proposed by Thole. While the polarizability values were allowed to ﬂuctuate during the ForceBalance optimization

of AMOEBA14, they do not deviate signiﬁcantly from the AMOEBA03 model.
Repulsion-dispersion parameters (vdW radius and well-depth) were assigned to both the oxygen and hydrogen atom centers. AMOEBA14 has a larger vdW radius and well-depth for oxygen and a smaller vdW radius and well-depth for hydrogen compared to AMOEBA03. The newly proposed reduction factor for hydrogen shifts the hydrogen vdW center toward oxygen by approximately 20% of the O−H bond length. The parameter optimization approached a point of zeroing out the hydrogen vdW site and reducing the model to one repulsion-dispersion site on oxygen, but the ﬁnal set of parameters includes both atoms and the description of the water oxygen is consistent with the description of oxygen in other organic molecules for the AMOEBA model.
The AMOEBA14 water model increases the charge of the oxygen and decreases the charge of the hydrogen in comparison to the AMOEBA03 model. The z-component of the oxygen dipole is less than AMOEBA03, and the x- and z-components of the hydrogen dipole are greater. There are substantial deviations for both the oxygen and hydrogen quadrupole parameters in relation to the AMOEBA03 model. The xx-component of the quadrupole moment tensor decreases by approximately the same magnitude by which the yy-component of the quadrupole increases for oxygen. An increase of the same scale is observed for the xx- and yy-components of the quadrupole moment tensor for hydrogen, but there is a sign change for these hydrogen quadrupole parameters. These changes in the nonbonded interactions reﬂect improvements in the gas phase and condensed phase properties of water described in the next sections.

and AMOEBA03 water models. The AMOEBA14 water parameters predict the dipole of a gas phase water monomer to be 1.808 D in comparison to the experimental value of 1.855 D. The changes in the atomic quadrupole parameters improve the molecular xx-quadrupole moment compared to experiment, while the yy- and zz-quadrupole moments are nearly unchanged in comparison to the AMOEBA03 model.
As in the original AMOEBA model, the ideal bond angle is larger than the experimental and ab initio values. The three vibrational frequencies of the water monomer are predicted to within 0.3 cm−1, and the ordering of the modes is in agreement with experiment. In Table 3, the AMOEBA water dimer

equilibrium structure and interaction energy are compared to experiment and ab initio results. For the equilibrium dimer minimum, the AMOEBA14 model is in somewhat poorer agreement with ab initio values than the earlier AMOEBA03 model. However, averaged over a series of low energy dimer conﬁgurations, AMOEBA14 is as good as or superior to AMOEBA03. As previously noted, 10 ab initio dimer interaction energies and geometries were including in the ﬁtting of the model parameters. The root mean squared deviations (RMSDs) for the monomer and dimer geometries were 0.017 and 0.057 Å, respectively.
The interaction energies for water clusters, ranging from dimers to clusters of 20 water molecules (see Table 4), were analyzed with the AMOEBA water model. The geometries of the clusters were optimized and the interaction energy determined via AMOEBA. The cluster results are compiled in Table 4. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) for the interaction energy of the smaller clusters (2−8 water molecules) is 0.39 kcal/mol, considered to be within chemical accuracy (i.e., within 1 kcal/ mol of experiment). Speciﬁc results for the hexamers are shown in Figure 2. The larger clusters (11- to 20-mers) have an MAD of 7.97 kcal/mol for the interaction energy prediction. The discrepancy between the accuracy levels of the AMOEBA water model for the small and large clusters is interesting and would suggest the error of AMOEBA with respect to system size could be systematic. To examine this possibility, the MADs of each of the condensed phase properties (discussed further below) were tabulated in Table 5, and the errors were of the same magnitude as the small clusters.
In the analysis of the 42 000 clusters (∼2400 clusters of n water molecules, n = 2−22), the potential energies, gradients, net forces, and torques were computed with AMOEBA14 and compared to the ab initio reference data. As a speciﬁc example of the results, the root mean squared (RMS) errors for the cluster of 18-mers were 7.8 kJ/mol (10%) for the energy, 33.8 kJ/mol/Å (42%) for the gradient, 9.9 kJ/mol/Å (30%) for the net force, and 6.3 kJ/mol/rad (25%) for the torque. The standard deviations for the reference data were 29.2 kJ/mol, 83 kJ/mol/ Å, 29 kJ/mol/Å, and 20 kJ/mol/rad for the energies, gradients, forces, and torques, respectively. Over all of the cluster sizes, the AMOEBA14 model predicted the potential energies to, on average, within 15% of the reference. This accuracy level is surprising when the weighting of the reference data is considered. The bulk clusters were assigned the smallest weights; i.e., ﬁtting the energies and gradients was the lowest priority in the parameter optimization. The robustness of the AMOEBA14 model in comparison to ab initio cluster reference data reaﬃrms the utility of the model for both gas and bulk phase properties.

The second virial coeﬃcient of water computed with an empirical potential is a sensitive measure of the accuracy of the Boltzmann-weighted dimer potential energy surface. Following Millot et al., we computed the classical virial coeﬃcient, as well as ﬁrst-order translational and rotational quantum corrections.76 Some workers have argued that the quantum corrections are unnecessary, as they are implicitly incorporated into empirical water potentials.77 Others have emphasized the importance of higher-order corrections and experimental error, especially at temperatures below about 325 K.78 Figure 3 shows both the

classical and ﬁrst-order corrected second virial coeﬃcients for the AMOEBA03 and AMOEBA14 models. The two models exhibit very similar behavior, and in both cases, the uncorrected coeﬃcients are in excellent agreement with experiment. Nonpolarized models intended for use in the bulk phase simulation tend to lie below the experimental second virial curve, especially at low temperature. The iAMOEBA model (not shown) is also somewhat underpolarized, and also yields second virial coeﬃcients that are too negative.
In previous work,25 the dependence of the density maximum on the water geometry was explored. The 2003 model adopted an equilibrium angle of 108.5° in the gas phase (“correct” value per ab initio: 104.5°) in order to achieve an average angle of

105.3° in the condensed phase and be in near agreement with experiment at room temperature. With the reoptimized AMOEBA parameters, the equilibrium gas phase angle is 107.8° and the condensed phase angle is 105.1°. The average AMOEBA14 H−O−H angle slightly increases (104.9 to 105.4°) as the temperature increases from 249 to 373 K. While previous theoretical estimates concluded the liquid water should see the angle contract with increasing temperature,79 experimental data has reported no relation between angle magnitude and temperature.80
AMOEBA14 Fitted Condensed Phase Water Properties.
In the parametrization of the initial AMOEBA03 water model, only the density and heat of vaporization at room temperature were considered. Within the ﬁtting of the current model, six condensed phase properties were considered at a range of temperatures (249−373 K) and pressures (1 atm to 8 kilobar). For AMOEBA14, the enthalpy of vaporization and density trends with temperature were the focal points in the ﬁt and were given a greater weight in the optimization. All of the thermodynamic data and their trends with respect to temperature are shown in Figures 2−5, while tables with the raw numbers are included in the Supporting Information.
Since AMOEBA03 was speciﬁcally ﬁt to the enthalpy of vaporization and the density at room temperature, the initial model agrees with the corresponding experimental values to within statistical error. However, the linear temperature dependence of the enthalpy of vaporization only intersects with the experiment at room temperature. With the AMOEBA14 water model, the enthalpy of vaporization at room temperature diﬀers by only 0.49 kcal/mol over the temperature range examined, and the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the model was 0.43 kcal/mol compared to 0.65 for AMOEBA03 (Figure 4). The experimental maximum density of 999.972 kg/m3 occurs at 277.15 K and 1.0 atm of pressure. The temperature of maximum density as predicted by the AMOEBA03 model is shifted to higher temperatures by nearly 15 K, and the curve of the temperature dependence is slightly narrower. The new AMOEBA14 water parameters yield a temperature of maximum density in quantitative agreement with experiment, and the shape of the curve is in qualitative agreement with experiment (Figure 5).

to the approximations within our classical, ﬂexible model, and previous work has estimated the accuracy of the heat capacity determined by AMOEBA to be ±5 cal/mol/K.25 While an overestimation of the heat capacity means an overestimation of the entropy ﬂuctuations, what matters more is that the temperature onset of anomalous ﬂuctuations (i.e., above the normal background) is better described by the AMOEBA14 model relative to AMOEBA03 (Figure 6).81
The AMOEBA14 model also shows a drastic improvement in the quantitative value of the isothermal compressibility in comparison to the 2003 model, which overestimates the compressibility by ∼30% under ambient conditions. Again, the more important point is that the temperature trends are correct for AMOEBA14, with a compressibility minimum very near the 319 K value seen experimentally (Figure 7). AMOEBA14 not

Finally, Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant, which is in excellent agreement with experiment, and also agrees well with the AMOEBA03 value of ∼80 at room temperature.

the dipolar correlations are suppressed when the quadrupole interactions increase, thereby decreasing the dielectric constant of the liquid.82 It has been noted83 that, since the dielectric response arises from both the magnitude as well as the ﬂuctuations of the water dipole, by deﬁnition, a good dielectric constant can be achieved by a model with either small dipoles with large ﬂuctuations (corresponding to small quadrupoles < ∼1.8 D-Å) or large dipoles with small ﬂuctuations (large quadrupoles > ∼2.5 D-Å). It appears, therefore, that the polarization of the AMOEBA models give rise to dipoles that are large enough to overcome the quadrupolar quenching in achieving its excellent dielectric properties.
AMOEBA14 Validation. Radial Distribution Function. The radial distribution functions (RDFs) can be derived from X-ray scattering and neutron diﬀraction84,85 and provide information about the structure of liquid water. Figure 10 shows the oxygen− oxygen RDF curve of the AMOEBA03, AMOEBA14, and iAMOEBA models when compared against the ALS86 and more recent APS87 experimental estimates of the real space structure derived from the intensity data. The gOH(r) and gHH(r) curves are included in the Supporting Information. The AMOEBA14 model is in overall good agreement with experiment for the three

distributions. The height of the ﬁrst peak in gOO(r) is approximately 0.4 and 0.6 greater than the ALS and APS X-ray data, respectively, but the location of the peak is at the same oxygen−oxygen distance as experiment. The ﬁrst and second troughs, as well as the second peak, of the gOO(r) nearly overlap the experimental curve, with deviations of less than 0.1%. A similar level of agreement is seen between the AMOEBA models and experiment for the gOH(r) and gHH(r), and as an eﬀective potential, it probably captures, imperfectly, any nuclear quantum eﬀects. Prior path integral and classical MD simulations of ﬂexible water models, such as for TIP4F,32 suggest the ﬁrst gOO(r) peak is reduced in height and shifted to a slightly larger distance in the path integral calculations.
Assuming a model for the condensed phase water electron density based on modiﬁed atomic form factors (MAFFs),86 we can Fourier transform the radial distribution functions to derive a simulated intensity curve to compare against the ALS88 and APS87 intensity data (Figure 11). Since the RDFs were not

included in the calibration data, we performed three optimizations with diﬀerent molecular polarizability targets (1.35, 1.41, and 1.47 Å3) to determine its eﬀect on water structure. The lower bound is based on an earlier ab initio calculation that suggested a reduction in the molecular polarizability in going from the gas phase (1.47 Å3) to the condensed phase (1.35 Å3).89 More recent work has evaluated the molecular polarizability in the liquid using a diﬀerent method, and determined that it was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the gas phase value.90 It is evident from Figure 11 that modifying, within reason, the polarizability produced no qualitative diﬀerence in the RDFs, although other properties may be sensitive to other water properties, though we do not investigate them here. Overall, the AMOEBA model intensities fall outside the diﬀerences between the ALS and APS experiments, which is likely a result of the larger ﬁrst peak in the gOO(r) compared to experimental estimates.
Electrostatic Potential. The general protocol in the development of novel AMOEBA parameters typically optimizes the atomic multipole parameters by ﬁtting to the molecular electrostatic potential generated via a gas phase ab initio molecular orbital calculation.50 As detailed above, the AMOEBA14 water multipole parameters were allowed to

ﬂuctuate in conjunction with the remaining parameters and the
monomer electrostatic potential map was not included in the ﬁtting. The TINKER POTENTIAL program was used to
compare the electrostatic potential for a single water molecule on a dense, uniform grid of points in a band 1.0−2.05 Å from the
vdw surface. The average magnitude for the electrostatic
potential from an MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ calculation was 6.6851 kcal/mol/e−, and the deviations for AMOEBA03 and AMOEBA14 were found to be −0.0499 and −0.0584. While the AMOEBA14 model was not ﬁt to the ab initio electrostatic potential, the model is clearly eﬀective for gas phase calculations
outside of the calibration data. Transport and Surface Tension Properties at Room
Temperature. The viscosity, self-diﬀusion constant, and surface
tension at room temperature were computed for the AMOEBA14 model. Viscosity was computed via the Einstein− Helfand relation and using the oﬀ-diagonal components of the
pressure tensor. The viscosity of AMOEBA14 is 0.900 centipoise
(cP) and is in nearly perfect agreement with the experimental measurement of 0.896 cP at 298 K.91 Self-diﬀusion was
computed via the Einstein equation via average motion over all
molecules across a full MD simulation. The standard selfdiﬀusion coeﬃcient as determined from an NPT simulation with 216 molecules in a periodic box is 1.99 × 10−5 cm2/s, which underestimates the experimental self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient of 2.29 × 10−5 cm2/s. Yeh and Hummer have suggested an analytical system-size correction for diﬀusion coeﬃcients computed via periodic MD simulation.92 Application of their correction increases the AMOEBA14 value to 2.36 × 10−5 cm2/s. Diﬀusion
is a key property where the importance of QNE is widely
debated. Recently, Habershon et al. have extensively compared
RPMD and classical simulation of water, and concluded that quantum ﬂuctuations only increase the translational diﬀusion rate by a factor of 1.15.35 This relatively small rate increase results from competing eﬀects of intra- and intermolecular zero point
energy, which increase the monomer dipole moment and
destabilize the hydrogen bonding network, respectively. The
surface tension computed via averaging over the diagonal elements of the pressure tensor is γ = 69.21 N/m, and deviates
less than 0.5% from the corresponding experimental value determined at 298 K.93 All of these properties are summarized in
Table 6. Ion−Water Interactions. It is important to validate the
AMOEBA14 water model for not only a homogeneous system but also a heterogeneous system. The ion−water interaction was
examined for the gas phase dimer system and the ion hydration
free energy. The ions considered were the sodium cation (r = 2.85, ε = 0.15, α = 0.12) and chloride anion (r = 4.20, ε = 0.5, α =
4.0). Ion hydration free energies were computed via the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) method.94 The binding energies and equilibrium distance for the ion−water dimer and
the ion hydration free energies are reported in Table 6. The AMOEBA14 model predictions for the ion−water dimer
interaction energies are within 0.5 kcal/mol of experiment,
while the ion hydration free energies are slightly overestimated for both the anion and the cation. Since water−ion intermolecular interactions are large and involve signiﬁcant
polarization, it is encouraging that the ion parameters required only a minor adjustment from the 2003 values25 for use with
AMOEBA14. While much further testing is necessary, this holds
promise that AMOEBA parameters for other systems will retain
compatibility with the new AMOEBA14 water model.

■ CONCLUSION

The inclusion of polarizability makes the AMOEBA model preferable over other ﬁxed-charge water models when characterizing water at diﬀerent state points, for asymmetric environ-

ments, and for better transferability. With the advances made in

computational modeling over the past decade, the AMOEBA

water model was revisited in order to calibrate the parameters

against a large, diverse data set. The new AMOEBA water model

improves in accuracy over the original model for the prediction of

bulk properties over large temperature and pressure ranges, in

addition to maintaining reliability for gas phase property

determination. By utilizing the ForceBalance methodology to

optimize the AMOEBA model, nearly two dozen parameters could be systematically ﬁt to a data set of ab initio calculations and

experimental measurements.

The new AMOEBA water model is an improvement over the

previous model, since a range of temperatures and pressures, as

well as more gas phase and bulk properties, were included in the ﬁtting of the parameters. For the six condensed phase properties

in the calibration data set, AMOEBA14 qualitatively matches the

experimental curves over the temperature range and the

deviations from experiment are generally within a reasonable

error margin. The current model exactly matches the

experimental temperature of maximum density and the enthalpy of vaporization at room temperature diﬀers by less than 0.5 kcal/

mol, with a mean absolute deviation of 0.43 kcal/mol over the

temperature range studied. The improvement observed for the

bulk phase prediction of the AMOEBA14 model does not come

at the expense of the accuracy of the model for gas phase property

observed between the experimental radial distribution functions for oxygen−oxygen, oxygen−hydrogen, and hydrogen−hydro-

balance of solvent−solvent, solvent−solute, and solute−solute interactions is crucial for determining solute behavior. Within this work, we have demonstrated the accuracy of the AMOEBA14 model for a heterogeneous system, speciﬁcally the calculation of ion hydration free energies. Future applications of the model, for example, determining ligand binding aﬃnities, will beneﬁt from the improved deﬁnition of the AMOEBA water parameters.
While the revised model reported here represents a clear improvement over the 2003 parametrization for the intended uses of AMOEBA, there are several missing features important for other applications of an empirical water potential. In particular, the AMOEBA model does not describe the coupling of electrostatics with the valence geometry, penetration eﬀects related to the point-based electrostatic model, quantum nuclear eﬀects, and the dissociability of water in the bulk phase.
When the bond lengths and bond angle of water change from their equilibrium gas phase values, the electrostatic potential changes in a fashion that is not fully accounted for by the translation of atomic charges or rotation of atomic multipoles in traditional biomolecular water models or AMOEBA. Palmo et al.95 have proposed a simple charge ﬂux treatment of electrostatic-valence coupling. Fanourgakis and Xantheas96 have explicitly included the monomer dipole moment surface as a function of geometry in their TTM2 family of water models. The latter method is correctly able to describe the increase in the H− O−H angle on moving from the gas to bulk phase. Models that do not include this additional coupling term exhibit a decreased average bond angle value in the liquid compared to the equilibrium parameter value. For example, AMOEBA models require an equilibrium H−O−H angle value near 108° in order to generate an average angle value80 of at least 105° in the liquid phase.
Most current generation water models are missing an explicit term to account for charge penetration eﬀects. Such a term is needed to correct for the use of point charges, or point multipoles in the case of AMOEBA, restricted to nuclear positions. A variety of empirical and semiempirical damping functions have been proposed to treat penetration in the context of both molecular mechanics,97−99 including the AMOEBA benzene dimer,100 and QM/MM calculations.101,102 We plan to explore how charge penetration eﬀects within the AMOEBA model impact the water parametrization. For example, the preliminary indication is inclusion of charge penetration reduces the largest diﬀerences between ab initio and AMOEBA dimer energies (see Table 4).
The AMOEBA model attempts to implicitly account for quantum nuclear eﬀects (QNEs) in the context of classical simulation. Other workers have generally found that only small changes to empirical parameter values are needed upon moving from classical to path integral simulation methods. Since current AMOEBA parameters for other molecules also account for QNE implicitly,50,51 we do the same here to maintain compatibility. In addition, explicit PIMD or RPMD calculations are signiﬁcantly slower than classical molecular dynamics, and are often too compute intensive for large-scale biomolecular simulation. This implicit QNE protocol could reduce the transferability of AMOEBA, since cluster data on the quantum BO-PES is combined during parametrization with empirical classical MD accounting for QNE in only an average way. While the MD data used in ﬁtting spans ambient and physiological temperatures, AMOEBA should provide a useful ﬁt across that range.
A limitation common to most current empirical water potentials is their inability to explicitly treat proton dissociation.

While potentials explicitly allowing proton dissociation were proposed over 35 years ago,103 such models are not commonly used in molecular simulation.104,105 More recently, several groups106−108 have introduced a new generation of dissociable water models. Since a main intended use of the AMOEBA potential is for large-scale biomolecular and materials simulation, addition of proton dissociation capability would enable new approaches to modeling of pH-dependent systems.109 This is an area we plan to address in a future extension of the AMOEBA model.
In summary, we have proposed a revised, eﬀective AMOEBA potential for water. Considering the improved performance of the revised AMOEBA water model in bulk phase property prediction, we recommend implementation of these updated parameters for future studies employing the AMOEBA polarizable water model. While empirical, the model provides good estimates for a wide range of properties, and is reasonably transferable between the gas phase and the bulk phase, as well as in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.
