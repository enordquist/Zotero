Electric-ﬁeld-induced wetting and dewetting in single hydrophobic nanopores

Matthew R. Powell1, Leah Cleary2, Matthew Davenport1, Kenneth J. Shea2 and Zuzanna S. Siwy1*

The behaviour of water in nanopores is very different from that of bulk water1,2. Close to hydrophobic surfaces, the water density has been found to be lower than in the bulk3, and if con-
ﬁned in a sufﬁciently narrow hydrophobic nanopore, water can spontaneously evaporate1,4. Molecular dynamics simulations
have suggested that a nanopore can be switched between dry
and wet states by applying an electric potential across the nanopore membrane5–8. Nanopores with hydrophobic walls
could therefore create a gate system for water, and also for
ionic and neutral species. Here, we show that single hydro-
phobic nanopores can undergo reversible wetting and dewet-
ting due to condensation and evaporation of water inside the
pores. The reversible process is observed as ﬂuctuations
between conducting and non-conducting ionic states and can
be regulated by a transmembrane electric potential.
So far, hydrophobic man-made nanoporous systems have consisted of multipore membranes that transport water solutions when a pressure difference is applied across them9. Hydrophobic nanopores with diameters less than 50 nm require pressures of tens of atmospheres to allow water and ionic transport. Making use of a transmembrane electric potential offers an attractive alternative to pressure-driven transport as it does not require the system to be highly mechanically robust—either inherently or through supports—and it can therefore be applicable to a wider variety of nanopore platforms, including biological channels in lipid bilayers. The suggested physical mechanism of the electric-ﬁeld wetting effect is based on orienting water dipoles in the ﬁeld and water electrostriction (that is, increase in water density) in the hydrophobic regions, which ultimately leads to a pore ﬁlling with liquid water6,7,10. The process of wetting/dewetting via the hydrophobic lining of the pore walls has also been recognized as a key mechanism for the function of bacterial mechano-sensitive biological channels11 as well as a wide family of voltage-gated channels in which the existence of a conserved hydrophobic region has recently been reported12. Formation of nanobubbles in the pore lumen has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for ion channel gating13.
The main challenge in building a hydrophobic valve is the ‘drying’ (through water evaporation) of the once wet pores on removal of the stimulus. Almost all hydrophobic membranes reported to date are one-time devices: once wetted, they remain ﬁlled with water and allow mass transport14. Only one recent report10 has demonstrated the ability of hydrophobic SiN pores to reversibly switch between low and high conductance states. However, the low conductance state still exhibited a ﬁnite ion current, probably because of the relatively large pore opening diameter (between 60 and 600 nm) and small thickness (300 nm) of the SiN pores10. Dewetting of nanopores is thermodynamically favourable for a wide range of nanopore diameters, but has been predicted to be kinetically feasible only in nanopores several nanometres in diameter15–17. In our experiments, which were performed with long nanopores (two to four orders of

magnitude longer than those used in previous simulations16,17 and experiments10), we observed spontaneous wetting (ﬁnite conductance) and dewetting (zero conductance) processes recorded as ion current ﬂuctuations in pores with diameters up to 20 nm. Furthermore, the process could be regulated by applying an external voltage in the range 0–10 V.
Single conically shaped nanopores were prepared in 12-mm-thick ﬁlms of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using a track-etching technique18,19. The large opening of the studied pores was
500 nm in diameter, and the small opening was between 4 and 30 nm. As a result of the pore fabrication technique, the pore walls contained carboxyl groups at a density of 1 nm22; these render the pores hydrophilic and allow them to be ﬁlled easily with an electrolyte solution. A nanometre opening of the as-prepared nanopores was conﬁrmed by observing rectifying properties of the structures in 0.1 M KCl solution (pH 8), in which the carboxyl groups were deprotonated19–21. The carboxyl groups also allowed methyl groups to be grafted onto the pore walls by treatment of the membranes with (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane in methanol to provide methyl esters. The success of the reaction was conﬁrmed by measuring the contact angle of a planar PET etched surface that was subjected to the same chemical modiﬁcation as the single nanopores. An etched PET surface is characterized by a contact angle of 608, but overnight reaction in 200 mM (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane results in a hydrophobic surface characterized by a contact angle of 1028. The hydrophobic character of the surface arises because of the introduced methyl groups as well as the exposed aromatic groups of the polymer structure. The transport properties of the modiﬁed pores were studied as a function of modiﬁcation time and (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane concentration (Supplementary Table S1). Modiﬁcation of the pore walls for short reaction times at dilute concentrations of (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane (0.1–12 mM) induced voltage-dependent ionic transport through the structures, which was studied by recording 2-min-long ion-current time series. Averaging the time series resulted in current–voltage curves that allowed for a quick assessment of the voltage sensitivity of the pores (Fig. 1a). Figure 1 shows the ion current through a nanopore with a narrow opening (diameter, 16 nm) that was modiﬁed with 12 mM (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane for 15 min. For voltages below 1 V, the pore was mostly closed and no current was recorded. At 2 V the pore opened, and bursts of large-amplitude current signals of several nanoamperes could be observed. The bursts became more frequent at higher voltages and eventually, at þ5 V, the pore remained in the open state (Fig. 1c). The voltage-dependent enabling of ionic transport did not always induce the quick kinetic opening and closing as is shown for positive voltages in Fig. 1. When negative voltages were applied (Fig. 1d), the same pore opened and closed on a much slower timescale, to the extent that the pore would stay in the open state for up to tens of seconds.

Quick opening and closing kinetics were observed for positive voltages between 2 V and 4.0 V (time series for 2 V and 3.5 V are shown). For negative voltages the pore stayed in the conducting and non-conducting states for much longer periods, on the order of tens of seconds (recordings at 21 V, 21.5 V, 22 V). All recordings were performed in an as-prepared, non-degassed solution of 1 M KCl, pH 8 (Tris buffer). Letters with asterisks in a indicate time series for which averages are marked on the graph with a star. The hysteresis seen for positive voltages was not present in all voltage scans performed for this pore (Fig. 2). In other pores the hysteresis occurred for either of the two voltage polarities (data in Supplementary Information). The pore switching can have two-state or multiple-state character (Supplementary Figs S2–S13).

We would like to emphasize that within the picoampere resolution of our recording system, the non-conducting, closed state was characterized by no current. Such a perfectly non-conducting state is typically obtained only when the two chambers of the conductivity cell are not connected by an electrolyte (for example, when the pore is not ﬁlled with the solution or there is no pore in the membrane at all). We propose that the non-conducting state observed with the (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane-modiﬁed pores corresponds to the pore or at least a section of the pore being ﬁlled with water vapour, whereas the conducting state indicates wetting of the pore along its whole length.
To conﬁrm the reversibility of the pore switching between conducting and non-conducting states the voltage was switched between þ1 V when the pore was closed and þ5 V, when the pore was expected to open (Fig. 1a,c). Excellent reproducibility of the pore gating and almost instantaneous switching was demonstrated, as shown in Fig. 2a. Additional voltage scans were performed between 25 V and þ5 V to obtain data similar to that in Fig. 1 for the same nanopore. Current–voltage curves of two scans are shown in Fig. 2b and conﬁrm the voltage-induced and reversible opening and closing of the pore to ionic transport. The voltage at which the

pore opening occurs changes with each scan; however, the closure of the pore at 1 V was reproduced (Supplementary Fig. S1).
It is also important to note that the kinetics of the opening and closing of the pores changes with each voltage sweep (Supplementary Figs S2–S13). The fast kinetics of pore switching for some pores appears for opposite voltage polarities and different voltage values (Supplementary Figs S5–S9). In some cases, the pore opening was very abrupt and not preceded by current ﬂuctuations (Supplementary Figs S3–S7).
The data shown in Figs 1 and 2 were obtained with as-prepared (non-degassed) KCl solutions. To evaluate the importance of the dissolved gases in the voltage-gating process3, we also measured ion current with a solution that was degassed in a vacuum chamber for 2 h. Controlled opening and closing of the ion current with voltage was indeed observed with the degassed solution, conﬁrming that the dissolved gases did not play a substantial role in the hydrophobic gating observed in the polymer pores (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs S4–S6).
Nanopores modiﬁed in 200 mM (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane for 2 h and longer did not exhibit any ionic transport with external voltages up to 10 V. The pores were, however, physically open,

Figure 2 | Reversibility of the opening and closing of a hydrophobic nanopore with voltage. Data were recorded for the same nanopore as in Fig. 1. The pore opening diameter was 16 nm, and the pore was subjected to 15 min modiﬁcation in 12 mM (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane. a, The voltage was manually switched between þ1 V and þ5 V, leading to reversible switching of the pore between non-conducting and conducting states. b, Current–voltage curves obtained by averaging 2-min ion-current series recorded when the voltage was changed in steps of 0.5 V from 0 V to þ5 V, followed by a sweep from þ4.5 V to 25 V and from 24.5 V to 0 V. Two such voltage scans were performed (Scan 2 and Scan 3) after the data in Fig. 1 had been measured. The scans are presented in separate graphs to facilitate comparison of the hysteresis effect. The voltages scans are superimposed as one graph in Supplementary Fig. S1. All recordings were performed in an as-prepared, non-degassed solution of 1 M KCl, pH 8 (Tris buffer).

Figure 3 | Hydrophobic gating studied in a degassed solution of 1 M KCl. a–c, The potential inﬂuence of dissolved gases on the ability of a pore to switch between conducting and non-conducting states was studied in a 16-nm-diameter pore modiﬁed in 5 mM (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane for 15 min. Ion current recordings were performed in a 1 M KCl solution that was degassed in a vacuum chamber. The voltage sweeps in a (Scan 1) and c (Scan 3) were repeated twice with voltage steps of 0.5 V, from 0 V to 25 V, from 24.5 V to þ5 V and from þ4.5 V to 0 V. Scan 2 (b) was performed in the voltage range 22 V to þ2 V, in steps of 0.2 V. At each voltage step, the ion-current time series was recorded for 2 min. The presented current–voltage curves were obtained by averaging the ion-current time series. Details of the ion current switching in time are shown in the Supplementary Information.

because washing the pores with ethanol (and quick drying in air) before the introduction of KCl solution into the cell facilitated ﬁlling the pores with the electrolyte, and voltage-induced openings and closings (Supplementary Table S1, Figs S14–S16).

The question still remains whether the non-conducting state of
our nanopores indeed corresponds to the presence of water
vapour. Hydrophobic nanopores were predicted to exhibit a higher barrier to ions than water22,23. A hydrophobic nanopore can therefore

Figure 4 | Scheme of hydrophobic gating with an electric ﬁeld. a, An unmodiﬁed PET pore is hydrophilic, as indicated by a contact angle of 608 (image in left panel) measured on a planar surface. Overnight modiﬁcation of the pores in a concentrated solution of (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane led to homogeneously hydrophobic surfaces with a contact angle of 1028 (image in middle panel). b, Shorter modiﬁcations performed in diluted solutions of (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane led to the formation of less hydrophobic surfaces characterized by contact angles less than 908 (Supplementary Table S2). We propose that local hydrophobic clusters are created, which induce the formation of local vapour pockets. Applying an electric ﬁeld across the membrane favours ﬁlling the pore with water and therefore ionic transport. A small fragment of a polymer nanopore is presented and its shape is approximated by a cylinder.

potentially contain just water, but still no ionic transport will occur. To investigate this, we performed ion current measurements of (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane-modiﬁed nanopores in 0.1 M HCl. If the pores contain liquid water along their entire length, then we should see a residual current originating from proton transport due to the Grotthuss mechanism. It is well known that it is difﬁcult to prevent protons from ﬂowing through even a single ﬁle of water as occurs in aquaporins24. Supplementary Fig. S18 conﬁrms that no ion current was observed in the (trimethylsilyl)diazomethanemodiﬁed nanopores in 0.1 M HCl, which provides evidence that the non-conducting state corresponds to a nanopore either completely or in part ﬁlled with water vapour and not liquid water.
Polymer nanopores (diameter, 15 nm) modiﬁed with 0.1–12 mM (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane for 15 min exhibited voltage-regulated hydrophobic gating (Fig. 1). Planar PET surfaces subjected to identical modiﬁcation had contact angles less than 908 (for example, 758 for modiﬁcation in 12 mM (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane, Supplementary Table S2), indicating that the chemical modiﬁcation was not complete, forming isolated hydrophobic clusters rather than a completely homogeneous hydrophobic surface (Fig. 4). Thus, water evaporation probably occurs only locally in the hydrophobic regions, which will also create the highest-resistance areas where the applied voltage will primarily drop. Wetting of hydrophobic pores was predicted to occur only when the applied electric ﬁeld exceeded the threshold value8,10, which is easier to obtain in nanopores with smaller hydrophobic clusters present in pores modiﬁed with a lower concentration of (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane. As modelled in refs 25–27, 2-nmlarge hydrophobic clusters, even if immersed in a hydrophilic matrix, are already sufﬁciently large to induce local water evaporation and the formation of vapour pockets.
In summary, we have reported nanopores with hydrophobic regions that exhibit voltage-dependent wetting and ionic transport. The observed non-conducting state was attributed to the existence of a local region ﬁlled with water vapour that created a high-resistance bottleneck to ionic transport. Hydrophobic nanopores and membranes could create an ideal system for controlled material delivery, which without an applied stimulus would not cause any unwanted leakage. In addition, single hydrophobic nanopores allow hydrophobic interactions and water structure to be studied at the nanoscale.

Methods
Preparation of single conical nanopores. Experiments were performed with single conically shaped nanopores embedded in 12-mm-thick PET ﬁlms. The pores were prepared by a track-etching technique18, which entails irradiating a polymer ﬁlm with single swift heavy ions and subsequent asymmetric etching in concentrated NaOH (ref. 19). The fabrication process leads to the formation of conically shaped nanopores. The diameter of the small opening was estimated based on an electrochemical technique which relates pore resistance to its geometry19. The large opening of the pore was determined from the rate of non-speciﬁc etching of the polymer material, which for PET at room temperature is 2.13 nm min21.
Chemical modiﬁcation of polymer pores. Track-etched PET ﬁlms were placed individually in a ﬂame-dried Erlenmeyer ﬂask purged with N2 and stoppered with a rubber septum. Freshly distilled MeOH was then added, followed by (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane(2 M in hexanes) to afford the desired concentration. After the requisite reaction time (15 min to 24 h), excess (trimethylsilyl) diazomethane was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of water. The ﬁlm was then removed from solution, washed successively with MeOH and water (3 × 5 ml), and allowed to air dry.
Ion current recordings. Single pore membranes were mounted between two chambers of a conductivity cell characterized by a seal resistance of 1,000 GV. We used home-made Ag/AgCl electrodes to measure the transmembrane current. The ion current was recorded using an Axopatch 200B ampliﬁer interfaced with a PC via a Digidata 1322A digitizer (Molecular Devices) using the voltage-clamp mode and a sampling frequency of 10 kHz. The signal was subsequently ﬁltered with a 2 kHz low-pass Bessel ﬁlter. The external voltage source of the Digidata was used to apply voltages in the range between 210 V and 10 V. The time series of ion current at each voltage was recorded for 2 min. Current–voltage curves were obtained by calculating arithmetic averages of the time recordings.
