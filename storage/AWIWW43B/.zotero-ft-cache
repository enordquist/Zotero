The sluggish diffusion of strontium vacancies in the perovskite-oxide SrTiO3 was studied by means of classical metadynamics simulations. Two different mechanisms were examined: the migration of an isolated strontium vacancy and the migration of a strontium vacancy in a defect associate with an oxygen vacancy. Combining activation Gibbs energies of migration with the appropriate temperature-dependent pre-exponential terms, we obtained diffusivities of strontium vacancies by the two mechanisms for the temperature range 1000 T /K 2000. Comparisons with experimental data (where available) yield excellent agreement, both in terms of the effective activation enthalpy of migration as well as the absolute rate of diffusion. In this way we demonstrate the ability of classical metadynamics simulations to predict diffusion coefﬁcients quantitatively for extremely slow-moving defects in oxides, and we highlight the complexity of cation diffusion in perovskite materials.

I. INTRODUCTION
Numerous studies devoted to the transport of A, B or O ions in the ABO3 perovskite structure testify to the dominant ionic defects being vacancies rather than interstitials and to anion vacancies being far more mobile than both types of cation vacancies [1–39]. The transport of the fast-moving anion vacancies has been investigated with a variety of experimental methods [10–14], such as tracer diffusion, nuclear spin relaxation, electrical conductivity, and various relaxation experiments. These methods yield, directly or with additional knowledge, the oxygen-vacancy diffusion coefﬁcient.
Complementary information has been obtained from atomistic simulations. Both molecular statics (MS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proved enormously helpful in interpreting experimental data and by allowing a deeper understanding of the migration processes on the atomic scale. MD simulations in particular have demonstrated their usefulness by providing not only activation enthalpies of oxygen-vacancy migration but also the absolute rates of oxygen-vacancy diffusion [15–19].
Cation vacancies in ABO3 perovskite-type oxides are not so amenable to investigation, partly because they are comparatively immobile and partly because they are rarely present in high concentrations (i.e., they are generally minority charge carriers). Tracer diffusion is thus the experimental technique of choice [7,20–23,26–28], but relaxation studies can also be applied in certain isolated cases [29,31]. Atomistic simulations have been restricted to MS calculations of the activation barriers for migration [18,33–39]. This is because the barriers are so high that they prohibit successful ion jumps occurring on the timescales accessible with MD simulations at

temperatures that can be considered physically reasonable [16,18] (i.e., not several thousand Kelvin above the melting temperature). Our knowledge of the absolute rates of cation-vacancy diffusion in ABO3 materials is thus rather rudimentary, despite cation diffusion determining processes such as dislocation climb [40], plastic deformation [41,42], creep [43,44], grain growth [42,45], precipitation of second phases [46–51], interdiffusion, and dopant segregation.
In this study we use metadynamics simulations to predict quantitatively cation-vacancy diffusivities in a perovskite oxide. Metadynamics methods accelerate MD simulations by introducing a bias potential that forces the migrating ion to overcome the (Gibbs energy) barrier. They have been applied to accelerate quantum-mechanical MD simulations of highly mobile ions in oxides (H+, Li+, O2−) [52–56], cases that are accessible with other methods, but rarely to accelerate classical MD simulations of comparatively immobile ions in oxides [57,58]; cases that are not accessible with other methods. Speciﬁcally, we examine strontium-vacancy diffusion in perovskite SrTiO3, ﬁrst, because the diffusivity of isolated strontium vacancies has been determined experimentally [29,30] (thus furnishing us with data with which to compare our results); second, because A-site vacancies govern the diffusion of both A and B cations in the perovskite structure [20,24–26,32]; and third, because recent studies [32,34] indicate that Sr diffuses not only as an isolated vacancy but also as a defect associate with an oxygen vacancy, but they do not provide a diffusivity for the defect associate. Our simulations employed classical pair potentials for the reason that the time scale of cation-vacancy diffusion is beyond the current capabilities of quantum-mechanical metadynamics. In view of their demonstrated ability to describe ion migration in perovskites [15,17,33], we used the set of pair potentials derived by Pedone et al. [59]. We emphasize that our use of classical pair potentials allows us to study point-defect behavior under dilute conditions at physically reasonable temperatures.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD
The diffusion coefﬁcient of strontium vacancies in (cubic) SrTiO3 can be expressed from random-walk theory in terms of the number of jump neighbors, Z, the jump distance, dv, and the rate constant for the barrier crossing, , as

Dv

=

Z 6

(1)

In order to compute , we applied the time-correlationfunction approach of rate theory as introduced by Yamamoto [60] and generalized by Chandler [61]. It is based on calculating the decay of the reactive ﬂux through the dividing surface that separates minima on the Gibbs energy surface [61–64]. Within the framework of this approach, the pathway of the activated process needs to be expressed as a function of one or more collective variables (CVs), ξ (r), which generally for migration processes are some Cartesian coordinates r. The transition state rate constant for crossing the barrier at ξ ∗ follows from classical transition state theory as

= |ξ˙ | ξ (0)=ξ∗ P(ξ i ) exp − G‡mig,v ,

(2)

kBT

where |ξ˙ | ξ(0)=ξ∗ denotes the conditional ensemble average of the velocity observable |ξ˙ | for the case that the system is initially (t = 0) held at ξ ∗; P(ξ i ) is the probability density of ﬁnding the system in the initial conﬁguration, ξ i; and G‡mig,v is the Gibbs energy difference between the system at the barrier top ξ ∗ and the initial conﬁguration, i.e., the activation
Gibbs energy of migration [56,62]. Intuitively, Eq. (2) can be
understood as the product of the mean velocity of the system
to cross the barrier without falling back to the initial potential
well (as given by the velocity average divided by 2 to only
include successful crossings) and the actual probability of
ﬁnding the system at that barrier maximum, which is given by the product of P(ξ i ) and the exponential expression. The three
terms in Eq. (2) can be obtained by applying suitable MD sampling techniques. G‡mig,v can be computed by means of metadynamics simulations. Straightforward MD simulations of the initial system conﬁguration give P(ξ i ): the trajectory
of the migrating ion along the path is evaluated in the form
of a histogram along ξ ; this histogram is then processed to give the probability density function P(ξ ), from which P(ξ i ) is obtained. The computation of |ξ˙ | ξ(0)=ξ∗ requires the implementation of constrained dynamics. That is, the system is ﬁrst equilibrated subject to the constraint ξ (0) = ξ ∗, i.e.,
the migrating ion is held at the top of the barrier; removal of the constraint permits barrier crossing, thus yielding |ξ˙ |;
averaging over a large number of simulation runs then gives |ξ˙ | ξ (0)=ξ∗ [62].

III. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
The interatomic forces for the molecular dynamics simulations were calculated from rigid-ion potentials acting between ions with partial charges, as derived by Pedone et al. [59] for glasses and binary oxides. These pair potentials comprise

three contributions

with the ﬁrst term accounting for the long-range Coulomb interactions, the second being a short-range Morse potential, and the third incorporating repulsive forces to prevent ions from approaching each other too closely in MD simulations. The empirical parameters for Eq. (3) were taken directly from Pedone et al. [59] without any modiﬁcation. These potentials, it is stressed, perform extraordinarily well for defect migration in perovskites, but less well for defect thermodynamics [15].
All simulation cells were created by removing a single strontium cation from a 8a × 8a × 8a bulk supercell of SrTiO3 (i.e., Sr512Ti512O1536), with a being the lattice parameter of cubic SrTiO3. This gives a vacancy site fraction under 0.5%, and the system can thus be regarded as a dilute solution. Within the isothermal-isobaric (N pT ) ensemble that was chosen for all simulations, the temperature and pressure (p = 0 GPa) were controlled by means of a Nosé-Hoover thermostat and barostat; preliminary simulations yielded relaxation times for the thermostat and barostat of 100 and 1000 time steps, respectively. Prior to each production run, the system was equilibrated for 50 ps, after which time the volume and energy of the system were conﬁrmed to be constant. The time step t for both equilibration and production runs was set to 1 fs for the case of isolated strontium-vacancy migration and to 0.35 fs for the case strontium-vacancy migration with an adjacent oxygen vacancy. This reduction in the step size was carried out to avoid instabilities in the numerical integration scheme that otherwise led to the collapse of the dynamics at longer simulation times and larger time steps.
The Gibbs energy hypersurface G(ξ ) along the predeﬁned collective coordinate ξ (r) was probed by means of metadynamics by gradually imposing additive Gaussian bias potentials on the system [65–67]. All simulations within this study were performed by using the LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) code [68]. For the metadynamics calculations, we additionally employed the COLVARS library as implemented in LAMMPS [69].

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The activation Gibbs energy of migration G‡mig,v obtained from metadynamics is sensitive to the choice of the CV for the activated process under study. In addition, the simulation expense scales with the number of CVs, and hence, there is an impetus to identify the smallest number of appropriate CVs that sufﬁciently describe the migration process. Consequently, we ﬁrst performed climbing-image nudged-elastic-band (CINEB) calculations, as they provide the form of the migration pathway, and thus allow us to choose suitable CVs (they also provide, for reference purposes, the activation energy of migration Em‡ ig,v).
A. Migration pathways
According to the NEB calculations, the jump of a Sr ion into an isolated strontium vacancy takes place along a linear path, whereas the jump into a strontium vacancy with a

namics simulations of the jump of a strontium cation into an isloated strontium vacancy with two parameter sets: A, ω = 0.12 eV and B, ω = 0.01 eV (σ = 0.2 A˚ and δt = 100 fs in both cases).

FIG. 1. Migration pathways (dashed orange lines) for the cases of strontium-ion migration (orange) into an isolated strontium vacancy (a) and into a strontium vacancy with an adjacent oxygen vacancy (b), as obtained by NEB calculations. Oxygen ions shown in grey, titanium ions in blue. Both paths are conﬁned to the xy plane of the Cartesian coordinate system, which allows us to express ξ in terms of x and y.
neighboring oxygen vacancy takes a curved path, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Both paths are conﬁned to a single plane (the xy plane), and hence we took the relative position coordinates x and y, which correspond to the distance of the migrating ion from its equilibrium position, for the CVs for the metadynamics simulations. In contrast to a rigorous deﬁnition of ξ as an one-dimensional pathway, this formulation is less restrictive on the exact pathway shape, in allowing an additional degree of freedom for the migrating ion. The migration barriers obtained from these NEB simulations were 3.93 eV and 3.34 eV for strontium-vacancy migration without and with an adjacent oxygen vacancy, respectively.
B. Metadynamics simulations
When performing metadynamics simulations, one needs to specify the height ω and the width σ of the added Gaussian bias potentials, and also the frequency with which they are added to the system, 1/δt. The optimal case is characterized by a smooth convergence of the Gibbs energy surface, and at the same time, an efﬁcient ﬁlling of the Gibbs energy landscape [67,70]. The trade-off between efﬁciency (large ω/δt) and accuracy (small ω/δt) at constant δt is illustrated in Fig. 2 for two parameter sets. For the ﬁrst set, the simulation converges rapidly (within 50 ps) as the Gibbs energy minima

are canceled out by Gaussians, but G‡mig,v ﬂuctuates considerably. For the second set, convergence is only achieved after several hundred ps, but the degree of ﬂuctuation in G‡mig,v is far lower. The second set of parameters was thus used
for all metadynamics studies of isolated strontium vacancies.
As minor ﬂuctuations are still evident, the best estimator for G(ξ ), and thus for G‡mig,v, is given by the averaged Gibbs energy surface after convergence is achieved (which is the case after 1.0 ns) [70]. A different set of parameters was found
to be required for the migration of a strontium vacancy in the defect associate (ω = 0.008 eV, σ = 0.2 A˚ , and δt = 52.5 fs).
In summary, the curves of Fig. 2 emphasize that simulation
runs of several ns are evidently indispensable in comput-
ing reliable averages, thus demonstrating the advantage of
MD simulations employing classical pair potentials over their
quantum-mechanical analogs. The averaged Gibbs energy surfaces G(ξ ) as obtained from
the metadynamics simulations at T = 1100 K for the two
migration mechanisms are depicted in Fig. 3. While the mi-
gration of an isolated strontium vacancy was found to take
place directly along the x axis [see Fig. 3(b)], the presence of
an adjacent oxygen vacancy introduces a slight bending of the
pathway towards the unoccupied oxygen site [see Fig. 3(d)].
These results at ﬁnite temperature conﬁrm the results obtained
from NEB calculations at zero temperature, classically by us
(see Sec. IV A above) and quantum mechanically by Walsh
et al. [34]. From the Gibbs energy surface G(ξ ), we extracted G‡mig,v; and by repeating the simulations for other temper-
atures, we obtained the data plotted in Fig. 4(a). For both migration mechanisms, G‡mig,v appears to vary linearly with temperature. This behavior indicates that the activation en-

Averaged Gibbs energy surfaces G(ξ ) along the x and y collective coordinates for the vSr migration without (a), (b) and with adjacent vO•• (c), (d) as obtained by metadynamics simulations at T = 1100 K. The starting point of the migration process, ξ i, is marked with an orange dot and the top of the migration barrier, ξ ∗, with a blue dot. The 2D mappings of the surface (b), (d) show that the adjacent vO•• causes a bending in the migration pathway of the Sr ion.

takes a constant (i.e., temperature-independent) value in each case, and hence, that the activation enthalpy of migration,

Hm‡ig,v = G‡mig,v + T Sm‡ ig,v,

(5)

also appears to be independent of temperature. For the case of
the migration without an adjacent oxygen vacancy, we thus obtain Hm‡ig,v = (3.98 ± 0.02) eV and Sm‡ ig,v = (3.5 ± 0.2) kB. When an oxygen vacancy is present, the migration barrier is reduced to Hm‡ig,v = (3.41 ± 0.02) eV and the entropy stays approximately unchanged at Sm‡ ig,v = (3.2 ± 0.2) kB.
These activation barriers show good agreement with the values of 3.93 eV and 3.34 eV, respectively, that were obtained from the NEB calculations (see Sec. IV A) (the latter
refer to internal energies rather than enthalpies, but the
difference between the two is negligible for normal condi-
tions). The comparison with experimental data is reserved for
Sec. IV C. Results from density-functional theory (DFT)-NEB
simulations by Walsh et al. [34], however, tend to slightly underestimate the migration barriers for strontium (3.68 eV and 2.92 eV) as well as for oxygen (0.53 eV compared to 0.62 − 0.67 eV from experiment [5,10–13]).
It is surprising to ﬁnd that Hm‡ig,v is essentially constant over such a large range of temperatures. Although the origin of
this behavior is not clear at the present, we exclude the possi-
bility of the behavior being an artefact that arises from the use
of pair potentials. For the temperature range of interest, these

pair potentials perform rather well, reproducing the thermal expansion coefﬁcient of the lattice and its isobaric heat capacity to within several percent, and reproducing excellently the oxygen-vacancy diffusivity [17].
C. Vacancy diffusion coefﬁcients
In order to obtain the vacancy jump rate , one requires P(ξ i ) and |ξ˙ | ξ(0)=ξ∗ at each temperature of interest, in addition to G‡mig,v [Eq. (2)]. The values we obtained for these two parameters are plotted in Fig. 4(b) and 4(c). With rising temperature the oscillation amplitude of the migrating Sr ion at position ξ i increases, leading to a ﬂattening of the Gaussian-shaped probability density function (not shown) and thus to a decrease in P(ξ i ) [see Fig. 4(b)]. The higher values of P(ξ i ) for the system with an adjacent oxygen vacancy indicate narrower density functions and consequently less extended oscillations of the Sr ion at its lattice site compared with the case without vacancy. For the conditional ensemble average of the CV velocity, |ξ˙ | ξ(0)=ξ∗ , we ﬁnd the reverse trend. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy, and therefore the velocity of the particles within the simulation cell, increases as expected. Apparently, the presence of the oxygen vacancy causes a slight increase in the velocity of the migrating ion at ξ (0) = ξ ∗.
Taking now values for dv(T ) directly from the MD simulations [i.e., dv = a(T )]; with Z = 6 for the migration of an isolated strontium vacancy and Z = 2 for the migration

in a defect associate; and with the data shown in Fig. 4, we can now calculate according to Eqs. (1) and (2) the diffusivities of strontium vacancies by the two mechanisms. The results are compared in Fig. 5 with experimental data. For

the case of strontium-vacancy migration without an adjacent oxygen vacancy, the diffusion coefﬁcients computed in this work show excellent agreement with the vacancy diffusion coefﬁcients determined in experimental studies [29,30]. As already expected from the lowered migration Gibbs energy, the presence of a neighboring oxygen vacancy substantially accelerates the diffusion of strontium vacancies, increasing it by more than one order of magnitude at T = 2000 K and by more than two orders of magnitude at T = 1000 K.
Experimentally, vacancy diffusion coefﬁcients are frequently analyzed in terms of a temperature-independent jump distance dv, a characteristic lattice frequency ν0, and effective activation quantities Hm‡iegf,fv and Sm‡ eigff,v [3–5]:

We analyzed our computational data with Eq. (6), obtaining the effective activation enthalpy according to Hm‡iegf,fv = −kB[d ln Dv(T )/dT −1]. By treating our computational data as if they were obtained experimentally, we can perform an
exact comparison with experimentally determined activation
enthalpies. In Table I, we compare our values for Hm‡iegf,fv with data
from experimental and computational studies. For the migration of isolated strontium vacancies, the value of (3.96 ± 0.02) eV obtained from our metadynamics simulations agrees
very well with the value of 3.96 eV obtained from static DFT calculations [35] and with values of 3.5 − 4 eV determined
in experimental studies that report the Sr-vacancy diffusivity
[29,30].
Such a comparison is not possible, however, for strontium-
vacancy migration as part of a defect associate. This is
because the diffusivity of the defect associate has not
been extracted from experimental diffusion data, as noted
in the Introduction, and hence its temperature dependence ( Hm‡ig,v) is unknown. Equivalently, one could say that the

activation enthalpy of diffusion ( HD) reported experimentally [32] has not been split into its component parts: HD =
Hm‡ig,v + Hgen,v. The missing information is the associate concentration ca as a function of temperature, with
Hgen,v = −kB[d ln ca/dT −1]. If one assumes for a certain temperature range that the associate concentration is constant, then Hgen,v = 0 and HD = Hm‡ig,v follows. On the basis of such an unsupported assumption, one thus ﬁnds that the experimental value [32] of HD = (3.0 ± 0.4) eV is consistent with our calculated value of (3.41 ± 0.02) eV.
If one were to take (i) a value of ν0 = 10.7 THz for the characteristic lattice frequency (calculated from ν0 = kBTD/h, with a Debye temperature of TD = 513 K [71] and with h as Planck’s constant) and (ii) the value of dv = 3.905 A˚ [72] for the jump distance, one could further analyze the data in Fig. 5
to obtain the effective activation entropy of migration. This value of ν0 refers, however, to all ions in the perfect SrTiO3 lattice. Is it a reasonable assumption for a strontium ion sitting next to a strontium vacancy? Does ν0 change when an oxygen vacancy is also present?
Our simulations provide, in fact, a method for determining ν0 directly for each case. By performing a parabolic ﬁt to the Gibbs energy surface of the system in its initial conﬁguration, i.e., at ξ i, one can compute ν0 via the force constant of the harmonic approximation. The Gibbs energy surface, in turn,
can be obtained either from the metadynamics simulations
or—computationally less intricate—from the unbiased probability distribution P(ξ ), as given by the relation G(ξ ) = −kBT ln P(ξ ). For the migration of an isolated strontium vacancy, we thus obtain, with the second method, characteristic frequencies between 10.5 THz at the lower temperature limit (T = 1000 K) and 9.9 THz at the upper limit (T = 2000 K).
These values show a remarkably weak dependence on temperature and remarkably good agreement with the value of ν0 calculated from the Debye temperature. For the migration of
the vacancy as part of the associate, we ﬁnd values a factor of 2 higher, from 21.0 THz (at T = 1000 K) to 19.6 THz (at T = 2000 K).
Given the weak temperature dependences, we approximate the two values as 10.2 THz and 20.3 THz and in this way
we obtain from the data in Fig. 5 activation entropies of Sm‡ eigff,v = (2.0 ± 0.2) kB for the migration of isolated stron-
tium vacancies, showing good agreement with corresponding experimental data from Gömann et al. [30], and Sm‡ eigff,v =

(0.88 ± 0.15) kB for the migration in a defect associate with
an adjcent oxygen vacancy (see Table I). Note that the effective activation enthalpies ( Hm‡iegf,fv) do
not differ vastly from the true values obtained from metadynamics ( Hm‡ig,v) nor from the NEB values. The activation entropies have to differ, however, because the effective value
includes the weak temperature dependences of dv, P(ξ i ) and |ξ˙ | ξ (0)=ξ∗ .

D. Strontium diffusion coefﬁcients

For the sake of completeness, we brieﬂy comment on the diffusion coefﬁcient of Sr and its activation enthalpy. Given the lack of quantitative knowledge about the associate concentration, we focus on the diffusion of Sr by isolated vacancies and assume the concentration of defect associates to be negligible. The diffusion coefﬁcient of Sr is thus given by

DSr

=

Dv

cv cSr

,

(7)

where cv is the concentration of strontium vacancies and cSr, the concentration of Sr ions. cv may vary strongly depending on whether the sample is acceptor-doped or donor-doped,
what exact temperature range is being considered, and what
the equilibrium oxygen partial pressure is. Let us take a
weakly acceptor-doped sample of SrTiO3 under oxidizing conditions as our example. At the very highest temperatures,
the defect structure will be governed by the SrO partial Schottky equilibrium, and Hgen,v = HSch/2 results (where
HSch is the enthalpy of Schottky disorder [73–75]). At lower temperatures, the defect structure is dominated by
acceptor dopants and charge compensating oxygen vacancies, which leads to a generation enthalpy of Hgen,v = HSch. At even lower temperatures (and/or shorter times), the cation sublattices will not be in equilibrium, and the concentration
of cation vacancies will be frozen in from some higher temperature; this corresponds to Hgen,v = 0. Thus, the activation enthalpy of Sr diffusion ( HD) will change from ( Hm‡iegf,fv + HSch/2) to ( Hm‡iegf,fv + HSch) to ( Hm‡iegf,fv), with decreasing temperature.
If one were now to allow defect associates of strontium
vacancies with oxygen vacancies to form, a process that will
occur at lower temperatures, the behavior becomes more com-
plicated. Example calculations are presented and discussed
elsewhere [32].

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this study, we have demonstrated the application of metadynamics simulations within the time-correlationfunction approach of rate theory to determine, without approximations, the diffusivities of minority, slow-moving defects (strontium vacancies) in SrTiO3. Three points are emphasized.
First, the computed diffusivities for isolated strontium vacancies are in excellent accord with available experimental data. There is also excellent agreement between our activation enthalpy of migration of 4 eV and literature values obtained from experiment [30] or from DFT calculations [35].
Second, our results support previous experimental [32] and computational [34] work that the formation of a defect associate of a strontium vacancy with an oxygen vacancy decreases the activation enthalpy of strontium-vacancy migration. Furthermore, our results quantify the higher diffusivity

of the associate relative to that of the isolated strontium vacancy.
Third, all the quantities required to compute the strontiumvacancy diffusivity in SrTiO3 are accessible with suitable MD sampling techniques. This enabled us to predict quantitatively the absolute rates of migration for slow-moving defects over a physically reasonable range of temperatures. It thus opens up the possibility of extending these studies to cation-vacancy diffusion in other perovskite materials.
