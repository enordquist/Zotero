Mayer, Stefan Rüdiger and Bernd Bukau* Institut für Biochemie und Molekularbiologie, Universität Freiburg, Hermann-Herder-Str. 7, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany * Corresponding author Hsp70 chaperones assist a large variety of protein folding processes in the cell by transient association with short peptide segments of proteins. The sub- strate binding and release cycle is driven by the switching between the low affinity ATP bound state and the high affinity ADP bound state of Hsp70. Con- siderable progress has been made recently by the identification of in vivo substrates for the Escherichia coli homolog, DnaK, and the molecular mechanisms which govern the DnaK-substrate interactions. Here we review the processes that generate DnaK sub- strates in vivo and the properties of these substrates, and we describe insights gained from structural and kinetic analysis of DnaK-substrate interaction. Key words: Aggregation / Hsp70 / Nascent polypeptide chains / Refolding / Substrate association and dissociation / Thermolabile proteins. Cellular Processes Generating DnaK Substrates DnaK interacts with short hydrophobic segments of pro- teins which generally are accessible to the chaperone only in non-native conformers. Consequently, all cellular pro- cesses generating such conformers potentially generate DnaK substrates, including de novo protein synthesis (Deuerling et al., 1999; Teter et al., 1999), protein translo- cation (Wild et al., 1996), assembly and disassembly of protein complexes (Alfano and McMacken 1989; Zylicz et al., 1989), and protein misfolding, especially under heat stress conditions (Gragerov et al., 1991; Mogk et al., 1999). We describe here in more detail the roles of DnaK in two processes, the de novo folding of proteins and the re- folding of misfolded proteins, since recent work elucidat- ed specifically these two populations of DnaK substrates. De Novo Folding Under normal growth conditions at 30 °C DnaK is involved in the folding of an estimated 5 – 18 % of all newly synthe- sized proteins in E. coli (Deuerling et al., 1999; Teter et al., 1999). In this activity the DnaK system functionally coop- erates with the ribosome-associated trigger factor, a pro- tein with chaperone-like and peptidyl-prolyl- cis - trans -iso- merase activities in vitro (Stoller et al., 1995; Hesterkamp et al., 1996; Deuerling et al., 1999; Teter et al., 1999). Due to its preferential location at the exit site for nascent chains, the trigger factor has the potential to assist the folding of newly synthesized proteins prior to DnaK, and the action of the trigger factor may make DnaK action dis- pensable in most cases as suggested by genetic analysis (Hesterkamp and Bukau, 1998). DnaK is dispensable for viability at 30 – 37 °C, unless the trigger factor is also ab- sent due to deletion of the trigger factor-encoding gene tig (Hesterkamp and Bukau 1998; Deuerling et al., 1999; Teter et al., 1999). Depletion of DnaK in  tig cells causes mas- sive aggregation of newly synthesized cytosolic proteins, amounting to 340 protein spots visible on two dimension- al gels (E. Deuerling and B. Bukau, unpublished results; Deuerling et al., 1999). These findings indicate that the DnaK system is able to compensate for the lack of ribo- some-associated trigger factor, either by cotranslational or posttranslational action. Protein Misfolding under Heat Shock Conditions DnaK becomes essential for viability at high temperature (> 37 °C) due to its essential role in repair of denatured pro- teins (Figure 1; Kusukawa and Yura 1988; Skowyra et al., 1990; Gragerov et al., 1992; Schröder et al., 1993; Tomoy- asu et al., 1998; Mogk et al., 1999). This repair function re- lies in part on the ability of DnaK to prevent aggregation of misfolded proteins and allowing their refolding. In addi- tion, DnaK appears to be capable of disaggregating ag- gregated proteins, as first shown by Zylicz and coworkers for aggregated RNA polymerase (Skowyra et al., 1990; Ziemienowicz et al., 1993). A recent study by Goloubinoff and coworkers provided further evidence for the potential of DnaK to disaggregate aggregated proteins (Diamant et al., 2000). These authors succeeded in generating stable glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase aggregates of de- fined size which could be separated by size exclusion chromatography. They found that disaggregation efficien- cy and the stoichiometry of chaperone versus substrate
