Abstract

Human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a conserved enzyme that is central to folate metabolism and is widely targeted in pathogenic diseases as well as cancers. Although studies have reported the fact that genetic mutations in DHFR leads to a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of folate metabolism and drug resistance, there is a lack of an extensive study on how the deleterious non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) disrupt its phenotypic effects. In this study, we aim at discovering the structural and functional consequences of nsSNPs in DHFR by employing a combined computational approach consisting of ten recently developed in silico tools for identification of damaging nsSNPs and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for getting deeper insights into the magnitudes of damaging effects. Our study revealed the presence of 12 most deleterious nsSNPs affecting the native phenotypic effects, with three (R71T, G118D, Y122D) identified in the co-factor and ligand binding active sites. MD simulations also suggested that these three SNPs particularly Y122D, alter the overall structural flexibility and dynamics of the native DHFR protein which can provide more understandings into the crucial roles of these mutants in influencing the loss of DHFR function.

1. Introduction

Dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3) is a housekeeping enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolic acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). Human DHFR gene, located in chromosome 5q11→q22, encodes the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme (DHFR) ( Fig. 1 ) ( Chen et al., 1982 , Chen et al., 1984 , Funanage et al., 1984 ). It has 28,758 bases ( Deloukas et al., 2001 , Lander et al., 2001 ) with six exons and five intervening introns ( Chen et al., 1984 ) while the encoded protein has 186 amino acids with a molecular weight of 21.3 kDa ( Kovalevskaya et al., 2005 ). DHFR is the key enzyme involved in folate metabolism ( Fig. S1 ). It catalyzes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) dependent reduction reaction and generates THF, the active form of folate. It is involved in the chemistry of the one-carbon transfer ( Chen et al., 1982 , Chen et al., 1984 , Batra et al., 2008 ) and plays vital roles as a coenzyme in many other metabolic reactions including the synthesis of amino acids, purines and thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) ( Schnell et al., 2004 , Strickland et al., 2013 ) which are essential for cell growth and proliferation ( Batra et al., 2008 ). Besides, THF can produce a methylating agent named S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) ( Bălănescu et al., 2019 ) that methylates protein, lipid, DNA and RNA, ultimately yielding S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). DHFR can also perform the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ) from dihydrobiopterin (BH 2 ) which has important roles in ‘eNOS coupling’, thus lowering oxidative stress during some vascular diseases ( Crabtree et al., 2009 ). Thus, any significant alteration in DHFR structure and function will eventually affect all of these important cellular metabolic pathways.

Mutation of the DHFR along with another folate metabolic gene ( FRα ) can cause intracellular folate deficiency ( Steinfeld et al., 2009 , Pérez-Dueñas et al., 2010 , Banka et al., 2011 , Cario et al., 2011 ). Many abnormal metabolic conditions including insulin resistance ( Yajnik et al., 2008 ), metabolic syndrome ( Li et al., 2018 ), fatty liver diseases ( Chmurzynska et al., 2020 ) and imbalance in the lipoprotein profile ( Semmler et al., 2010 ) are linked with anomalous regulation of folate metabolism. In addition, a major type of anemia called megaloblastic anemia, where the red blood cells are abnormal in shape, is associated with homozygous mutation of DHFR gene ( Cario et al., 2011 ). In the central nervous system, folate deficiency is linked with neural tube defects (NTDs), stroke, Parkinson’s diseases and dementia ( Dos Santos et al., 2009 ).

The crucial role of DHFR in folate homeostasis makes it a key chemotherapeutic target for cancer treatment in the last few decades ( Tai et al., 2002 ). For instance, although methotrexate (MTX) is a well-known chemotherapeutic drug targeting DHFR, its binding affinity is significantly reduced due to the mutation of this enzyme ( Mareya et al., 1998 , Chunduru et al., 1994 ). In fact, a substitution of leucine by arginine at 22 position (L22R) in human DHFR is said to decrease MTX binding affinity by 1300 times ( Mareya et al., 1998 ). Thus, functional polymorphisms affect either the expression or activity of DHFR and create a risk of folate-dependent disease ( S Askari and Krajinovic, 2010 ).

Polymorphism arises from genetic variation within or among populations with the influence of environmental stimuli that can result in a genetic trait or phenotypic alterations ( Brookes, 1999 , Rebbeck et al., 2004 , Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005 ). Genetic difference at a single position within a DNA among a population is referred to as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Human genome has at least 10 million SNPs occurring once in every 100-300 base pairs having an allelic frequency > 1% which is the prevalent variant type ( Lander et al., 2001 , Risch, 2000 , Orr and Chanock, 2008 ) and the number increases over the days ( Robert and Pelletier, 2018 ). Substitution of an amino acid by SNP is known as non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs). In the scientific community, nsSNPs have garnered interest since more amino acid variations lead to disease causing genetic lesions ( Ng and Henikoff, 2002 , Kumar et al., 2020 , Habib et al., 2021 ). Various studies have shown that more than 50% variations resulting from nsSNPs are attributed to hereditary genetic disorders ( Ramensky et al., 2002 , Radivojac et al., 2010 , Doniger et al., 2008 ).

To date, there is a lack of intensive nsSNPs study of DHFR gene. Therefore, considering the significant roles of the-gene coded protein, the functional and structural effects of nsSNPs of DHFR protein is investigated using a wide range of bioinformatics tools followed by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the detailed damaging impacts of the selected mutation on the DHFR protein.
2. Method and materials
2.1. Single nucleotide polymorphism data retrieval

The primary information on human DHFR was obtained from the GeneBank ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1719 ) and its nsSNPs related data was retrieved from the publicly available web-based database dbSNP-NCBI ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/?term=dhfr ) for in silico analysis (Sherry et al., 2001). In addition, the protein sequence (isoform-1) was collected in FASTA format from UniProtKB ( http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00374 ) ( Fig. 2 ).

Fig. 2 . Study design . Firstly, the nsSNPs of DHFR protein were retrieved from the online databases. Then, a group of in silico tools were selected for the functional and stability analyses of individual nsSNPs. After selecting the most deleterious nsSNPs, they were subjected to molecular phenotypic effects and evolutionary conservation analysis. Finally, the mutants residing in the active site (R71T, G118D, and Y122D) were selected for MD simulations .
2.2. Classification of the most deleterious nsSNPs

A combinatorial selection of different algorithmic prediction tools based on different methodologies (such as supervised learning-based, sequence structure-based, and sequence homology-based) were considered to improve the accuracy, precision, and performance in predicting the most deleterious nsSNPs ( Yazar and Özbek, 2021 ). Hence, two or more prediction tools from each aforementioned methodology were utilized to identify the most deleterious mutants of DHFR protein.
2.2.1. Functional analysis

The functional consequence of nsSNPs in the DHFR protein was predicted by scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), protein variant effect analyser (PROVEAN), SNPs&GO, Predictor of human Deleterious Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (PhD-SNP), PANTHER, Polyphen-2, Functional Analysis through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) and SNAP2 ( Fig. 2 ). SIFT ( http://sift.jcvi.org/ ) predicts weather a SNP is deleterious or tolerated on the basis of sequence homology and the physical properties of amino acids. The prediction varies due to the degree of amino acid conservation ( Ng and Henikoff, 2003 ).

PROVEAN ( http://provean.jcvi.org/index.php ) is a sequence-homology-based tool that predicts the deleterious effects of amino acid substitution on biological function of DHFR ( Choi et al., 2012 ). SNPs&GO ( https://snps.biofold.org/snps-and-go/snps-and-go.html ) is a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier that retrieves various data from gene ontology (GO) annotation for categorizing SNPs as disease-causing or neutral ( Calabrese et al., 2009 ). It provides predictions from two other bioinformatics tools: PhD-SNP ( Capriotti et al., 2006 ) and PANTHER ( Mi et al., 2016 ) in its output display.

PolyPhen-2 ( http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu ) predicts the functional consequence of amino acid substitution using a Bayesian classifier method. It calculates position-specific independent count (PSIC) scores for each of the two variants and then generating the score difference ( Adzhubei et al., 2013 ). FATHMM ( http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk/inherited.html ) is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and predicts the functional impacts of missense variants on a given protein. It uses two prediction algorithms: sequence/conservation based (unweighted) and sequence/conservation with pathogenicity weights (weighted). In the present study, an unweighted algorithm is being considered ( Shihab et al., 2013 ).

The functional effect of nsSNPs was also assessed by using a neural network-based classifier named SNAP2 ( https://rostlab.org/services/snap2web/ ). Using various biophysical characteristics, structural assets and evolutionary information, SNAP2 predicts whether a SNP alter protein stability or otherwise ( Bromberg and Rost, 2007 ).
2.2.2. Stability analysis

Protein structure and function may be affected by a SNP within the exonic region of DNA. For prediction of protein stability, I-Mutant2.0 and EASE-MM were used ( Fig. 2 ). I-Mutant2.0 ( http://folding.biofold.org/cgi-bin/i-mutant2.0.cgi ) is a support vector machine-based tool that uses ProTherm, ( Bava et al., 2004 ) a database for protein mutation.

The submitted input data were protein sequence, physiological temperature (37 °C), having a neutral pH (7.4) and mutation position. The stability change was predicted by evaluating the free energy change (DDG value) ( Capriotti et al., 2005 ). Another bioinformatics tool that predicts stability change as a result of SNP is EASE-MM ( http://sparks-lab.org/server/ease ). The tool consists of five support vector machine (SVM) models. It makes a prediction by using secondary structure and accessible surface area of the mutated residue through two models ( Folkman et al., 2016 ).
2.3. Molecular phenotypic effect investigation

A sequence and structure-based server named SNPeffect database 4.0 ( https://snpeffect.switchlab.org/ ) was used to predict the effect of SNP on DHFR structural phenotype. It is an integrated server that is linked with aggregation prediction (TANGO) ( Fernandez-Escamilla et al., 2004 ), amyloid prediction (WALTZ) ( Maurer-Stroh et al., 2010 ), chaperone-binding prediction (LIMBO) ( Van Durme et al., 2009 ) and FoldX ( Schymkowitz et al., 2005 ) tools. The mutational effects on the aggregation propensity, amyloid propensity, chaperon binding and protein stability were analyzed by this bioinformatics tool. It received UniProt ID (P00374) of DHFR protein as an input data, although FASTA sequence, PDB ID and SNP information can also be used ( De Baets et al., 2012 ) to strengthen the prediction.
2.4. Conservation analysis

Structure-function relationships of a protein, DNA or RNA may be highly affected by mutation in the evolutionary conserved region. ConSurf ( https://consurf.tau.ac.il ) server was used to analyze amino acid conservation in DHFR. It uses phylogenetic relationship of various homologous sequences ( Celniker et al., 2013 ). Using a Bayesian method, the server provides continuous conservation scores of nine grades with unique colors which were grouped into three types: variable (scores from 1 to 4), intermediate (scores from 5 to 6), and conserved (scores from 7 to 9) amino acids ( Ashkenazy et al., 2010 ).
2.5. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation

After functional and stability analyses of missense variants, the important nsSNPs which lie within the binding site of DHFR were investigated. Among the 12 most deleterious nsSNPs, three variants (R71T, G118D and Y122D) were within the co-factor and ligand binding active sites ( Thompson and Freisheim, 1991 , Cody et al., 2005 ). Therefore, these variants were selected for further MD simulations.
2.5.1. Preparation of the simulation system

To investigate the detailed insights of deleterious effect of the selected nsSNPs, MD simulation of the wild type DHFR and its three deleterious mutants located in the active binding sites were considered. The three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of DHFR were retrieved from the protein databank (PDB ID: 6a7e), and the respective variants were generated by Swiss-PdbViewer ( Guex and Peitsch, 1997 ). Subsequently, the structures were prepared by removing ligands and water molecules followed by the addition of hydrogen bonds as well as fixation of the bond orders and charges at a neutral pH ( Hollingsworth and Dror, 2018 ).

Simulation was performed via a GROMACS 4 package (version 2019) using the AMBER 03 force field ( Hess et al., 2008 ). The box dimensions ensured that any protein atom was at least 1.2 nm away from the edge of the box with periodic boundary conditions and was solvated by simple point-charge (SPC) water models ( van der Spoel et al., 1998 ). The system was neutralized by adding sodium chloride to reach 100 mM salt concentration in order to allow replication of the physiological ion concentration. Prior to running the actual dynamics, energy minimization was conducted using the steepest descent method (2,000 steps) to relax the molecular geometry of the system ( Fig. S2 ).

For short-range Coulomb and van der Waals interaction , the cut-off radius was set at 8 Å and the long-range electrostatic interactions were measured by the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method. Following the Berendsen temperature and the Parrinello-Rahman pressure couplings, the systems were equilibrated as human physiological conditions (310 K, 1 bar, pH 7.4) ( Fig. S2 ). Finally, the MD simulation of each system was run for 100 ns with a time step interval of 2.0 fs. The trajectory files were evaluated to get the root mean square deviations ( RMSD), root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), Rg , SASA, H-bond. Finally, secondary structure of proteins (DSSP) was defined using GROMACS data analysis tool (gmx do_dssp).
2.5.2. Dynamic cross-correlation maps (DCCMs) analysis

The dynamic nature of proteins can be characterized by the dynamic cross-correlation maps (DCCMs) through the time-correlated motions of residues. Hence, DCCMs were generated to analyze the dynamic conformations of DHFR from trajectories during simulation by utilizing the Bio3D, an R package ( Grant et al., 2006 ). The following equation allows calculation of the cross-correlation coefficient C i,j of two fluctuating Cα backbone atoms (i and j) of protein residues to quantify the dynamic correlation. c ij = ⟨ ∆ R i . ∆ R j ⟩ ⟨ ∆ R i . ∆ R i ⟩ ⟨ ∆ R j . ∆ R j ⟩ where ∆ R i and ∆ R j indicate the displacement vector of i and j atoms, respectively while the angular brackets denote the time average. The values of C i,j as 1 and -1 indicate completely correlated and anti-correlated movements, respectively. Any reduction from these values implies less correlated or anti-correlated motions ( Ichiye and Karplus, 1991 ).
2.5.3. Principle component analysis (PCA)

PCA is a standard mathematical tool that can be applied to the molecular dynamics trajectories to extract essential dynamics or large-scale conformational motions of a protein in any biological systems ( Maisuradze et al., 2009 ). It reduces the dimensionality by constructing a covariance matrix of multivariate energy factors into a low-dimensional space. The Cα atoms were used to accomplish the PCA and the covariance matrix C was calculated. The elements Cij in the matrix C are calculated as: Cij = ⟨ xi − xi ( xj − xj ) ⟩

In this formula, xi and xj represent the instant coordinates of the i th or j th atom, and xi and xj symbolize the average coordinate of the i th or j th atom over the ensemble. The PCA analysis was performed by using the Bio3D software ( Grant et al., 2006 ).
2.6. Statistical analysis

The statistical software, SPSS v19.0, was used to determine the correlation among the bioinformatics tools utilised. Statistical analysis for MD trajectories was performed by GraphPad Prism v 9.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com ) software.
3. Results
3.1. Employed SNPs data

The polymorphism data of DHFR was retrieved from the NCBI dbSNP database. Overall, 8160 SNPs in total have been found. The highest number of variants was in the intron region (6300 SNPs, 77.21%), followed by the noncoding variants (1064 SNPs, 13.04%), upstream variants (535 SNPs, 6.56%), downstream variants (106 SNPs, 1.30%), missense variants (98 SNPs, 1.20%), coding synonymous variants (37, 0.45%) and other type variants (20 SNPs, 0.25%). The latter includes the stop gained, frameshift, initiator codon , splice donor and acceptor variants ( Fig. 3 a ). Missense nsSNPs were further analyzed to determine their impact on DHFR protein as the wild-type amino acids are changed ( Table S1 ).

(*: significant at the 0.05 and **: at 0.01 level).
3.2. Prediction of the most deleterious nsSNPs

All of the 98 missense nsSNPs were screened to identify the most damaging ones by employing the ten prediction tools ( Fig. 3 b ). The predictions of all in silico tools in stability analysis were significantly correlated ( p  < 0.01/0.05) with each other. However, the correlation between the stability and the functional analyses tools were not significant as they use different algorithms which was expected ( Fig. 3 c ).
3.2.1. Functional analysis

Eight prediction tools were utilized to determine the functional consequences of 98 nsSNPs of DHFR protein ( Fig. 3 b ). SIFT predicted 64 nsSNPs as damaging, while 72 were predicted to be deleterious (by PROVEAN) and finally, 64 were predicted as disease-associated (by PANTHER). Based on PolyPhen-2 and FATHMM results, 58 and 34 nsSNPs were classified to have damaging effects on the DHFR protein, respectively. In addition, 51 and 73 nsSNPs were disease-associated based on PhD-SNP and SNP&GO respectively, while 56 nsSNPs were predicted as being affected by SNAP2 ( Table S1 ).
3.2.2. Stability analysis

The impact of nsSNPs on DHFR protein stability was determined for their damaging effects. In our study, two stability prediction tools (I-Mutant2.0 and EASE-MM)

were assigned ( Fig. 3 b ). Subsequently, I-Mutant2.0 categorized 87 nsSNPs as having decreasing effects on DHFR protein stability, while EASE-MM predicted 25 to be destabilizing and another 24 to be likely destabilizing.
3.3. The most deleterious nsSNPs selection

Based on the functional and stability studies, 12 out of the 98 nsSNPs were highly deleterious/damaging to the DHFR protein ( Table 1 ). Therefore, these were chosen for further study.

3.4. Phenotyping analysis by SNPeffect

Alterations in the phenotypic properties of the 12 high-risk variants were assessed by SNPeffect 4.0 by considering the aggregation propensity, amyloid forming tendency, chaperon binding propensity and changes in the stability ( Table 2 ). Among them, 11 variants (L23P, I52T, M53R/T, G54D, R71T, L76P, V113F, Y122D, D146G, P150A and F180C) were unaffected with dTANGO scores of between -26.31 and 32.00 in the aggregation prone regions.

NA: Not Affected, D: Decrease, I: Increase R: Reduced, SR: Severely Reduced, NE: No Effect , E: Enhanced.

Only G118D with dTANGO score -161.24 decreased the aggregation tendency of DHFR protein. In addition, the G118D variant also showed increased amyloid propensity (dWALTZ score 54.02), although there were no such effects for other 11 mutants. However, in accordance with LIMBO, only V113F was predicted to decrease the chaperon binding tendency of DHFR. Finally, the FoldX result predicted that nine nsSNPs can reduce DHFR stability. Among them, Y122D was anticipated to markedly reduce the stability while two (L23P and R71T) had no effects and interestingly, G54D was found to enhance DHFR stability instead.
3.5. Conservation analysis by ConSurf

It has been established that disease-causing mutation usually occurs in the highly conserved region of a gene. Interestingly, the results yielded from the ConSurf tool revealed that the overall human DHFR protein was highly conserved over the generations ( Fig. 4 ). In addition, ten (L23, I52, M53, G54, R71, G118, Y122, D146, P150 and F180) out of 12 highly risked mutant positions were presented in the highly conserved areas ( Table 3 ). Therefore, any alteration of these conserved residues significantly affects the structural and functional properties of the DHFR protein.

3.6. Molecular dynamics simulation

To assess the effects of nsSNPs of DHFR protein in terms of dynamic and structural stabilities, MD simulation were performed for 100 ns. The step encompasses both the native as well as three of the selected mutants (R71T, G118D and Y122D) in physiological conditions. Combining the RMSD, RMSF, Rg , SASA, H-bond, DCCM , PCA and secondary structure analysis, it was determined that all of the 3 mutants particularly Y122D, have shown noticeable structural instability when compared to the wild-type ( Figs. 5 and 6 ).

3.6.1. Effects of variants on conformational dynamics
3.6.1.1. Root mean square deviations (RMSD)

To determine the conformational stability of the proteins during simulation, the RMSD was calculated from the trajectory files of the wild type as well as its three selected deleterious mutants. RMSD analysis indicates that all of the three variants had significantly deviated from the wild type over the simulation period ( Fig. 5 a ). At 70 ns, the wild type variant deviated to a higher RMSD when compared to the starting level (~1.5 Å) for a short period before returning to the equilibration condition. It was evident that R71T, G118D and Y122D had higher RMSDs when compared to the wild type while Y122D had the highest RMSD (~4.87 Å) at 80 ns and continued to the maximum deviation. Besides, R71T and G118D mutants maintained similar RMSDs from the start of the simulation. Nevertheless, in case of G118D, the RMSD dropped slowly at 62 ns and reached to the level reported for the wild type while R71T continued approximately 2 Å up to the end of the simulation.
3.6.1.2. Radius of gyration (Rg)

The Rg values were calculated for all trajectories for assessment of the overall shape of protein structure caused by amino acid substitution . The average Rg value ( Table S2 ) of wild type protein was approximately 16.36 Å, which remained constant over the entire simulation period. The calculation indicates that the Rg value of G118D was slightly increase (~16.48 Å) up to 60 ns simulation and then overlapped with the value for the wild type throughout the end of simulation. Nevertheless, the Rg value of another mutant, R71T was lower (~16.22 Å) than that for the wild type after 30 ns simulation. The value continued to be the lowest when compared to other variants including the wild type protein, until the end of the simulation. On the other hand, Y122D showed a higher Rg value when compared to all variants and differed between 16.21 Å and 17.52 Å over the end of simulation with an average value of 16.94 Å. Overall, the gyration analysis of all the mutants predicted that the mutants G118D and R71T have similar compactness as with the wild protein, while Y122D induces maximum flexibilities while being less compact ( Fig. 5 b ).
3.6.1.3. Hydrogen bonding analysis

The total number of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) ( Table S2 ) within the protein during the MD simulation were counted and plotted based on the time ( Fig. 5 c ). The plotted data indicated that the wild protein structure formed a greater number of H-bonds (~132.24) when compared to all of the selected mutants, ~126.57 for the mutants R71T, ~130.66 for G118D and ~126.59 for Y122D structures. Since these mutants tend to have a lower number of H-bonds in their structure formations over the whole simulation time, the protein stability of those variants have been markedly impacted. More specifically, the fewer number of H-bonds formation within the structured of R71T and Y122D led to a higher degree of conformational flexibility as was observed in the Rg value in case of Y122D.
3.6.1.4. Solvent accessible surface area (SASA)

Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) revealed that the mutant G118D (107.93 nm 2 ) and Y122D (110.68 nm 2 ) yielded higher average SASA values when compared to that for the wild type, while the mutation R71T reduced the overall available surface area for the solvents ( Fig. 5 d and Table S2 ). Therefore, it was concluded that all the variants changed the native conformation of protein. The higher average SASA values of mutants (G118D and Y122D) indicated that these two structures were less stable when compared to the wild type protein, as also confirmed by the findings from the RMSD and Rg analyses.
3.6.2. Effects of variants on protein dynamics

To understand the dynamic effects of selected deleterious mutants on DHFR protein, the RMSF of each amino acid residue was calculated based on the MD trajectories. The RMSF analysis showed that the variants caused significant changes in the residual fluctuations with respect to wild type. The highest residual fluctuations of all variants were seen in the regions of 18 to 23 which consisted of B-sheets and T turn ( Fig. 6 a ). There was increased average residual fluctuation for all mutants when compared to the wild type, where the highest fluctuation happened for Y122D ( Table S2 ).

To get further insight into the fluctuations of residues, the B-factor for the C-alpha backbone atom of each residue was calculated ( Fig. 6 b ). The calculated average B-factor for the wild type, R71T, G118D and Y122D mutants DHFR were 21.86, 28.12, 44.55 and 46.86 Å 2 , respectively. The higher B-factor indicates higher fluctuation and increased flexibility, vice-versa. Thus, the average B-factor also indicated that a larger fluctuation appeared in the mutant DHFR, especially in cases of G118D and Y122D when compared to the wild-type protein. Hence, it was clear that the selected high-risked mutants caused an increased flexibility in the structures. Overall, the B-factor distribution on each C-alpha residue showing substantial differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins ( Fig. 6 b and c ).
3.6.3. Secondary structure element analysis

To investigate the aberration in the secondary structure organization of DHFR due to the R71T, G118D and Y122D mutations, we employed a Define Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) algorithm. The secondary structure element analysis indicated that there was no significant changes in the secondary structure of mutants ( Fig. S3 ). Therefore, to understand the information more clearly, the content of residues forming different types of secondary structure such as coil, α-Helix and β-Sheet were also monitored. However, there was no major differences between the wild type and mutants DHFR ( Fig. S4 ). Finally, the percentage of residues contributed to the formation of each type of secondary structure was calculated, confirming that there was no significant differences in the mutants when compared to the wild type ( Table S3 ).
3.6.4. Dynamic Cross-Correlation Maps (DCCMs) analysis

A correlative motion is investigated among the residues in various regions, especially the residues forming the region of the secondary structure in a protein ( Ichiye and Karplus, 1991 ). To analyze the changes in the movement of protein residues due to the mutation, the DCCMs analysis ( Fig. 7 ) was executed. The analysis revealed that the mutants (R71T, G118D and Y122D) exhibited significantly altered motions when compared with the wild type.

Fig. 7 . Dynamic Cross-Correlation Maps (DCCMs) of wild type DHFR and 3 deleterious mutants. (a) Wild type, (b) R71T, (c) G118D, and (d) Y122D. The colour bar indicates the degree of correlated and anti-correlated motions and the rectangular boxes in the figure denote the region participating correlated and anti-correlated motions when compared to the wild type DHFR.

Correlated motions were observed in the wild type between residues 1 to 11 and the 88 to 101 while anti-correlated motions were seen between the residues and 110 to 135 residues. On the other hand, a slight anti-correlated and a diminished anti-correlated motion appeared in correlated and anti-correlated motions in the mutants, respectively. In the wild type, residues 140 to 149 exhibited correlation in their movements with that for the residues 75 to 99 and 161 to 180. These correlated motions shifted into a random fashion appearing minute correlation or anti-correlation in the mutants. Residues 140 to 149 also showed anti-correlation with the 40 to 57 residues in the wild type. This manner almost disappeared in the mutants except for some residues. Furthermore, 59 to 76 residues displayed very little correlation and anti-correlation with the residues 167 to 178 in the wild type, while this random pattern converted to positive correlation in the mutants. Besides, Residues 80 to 99 moved in a correlated manner with the 161 to 168 and 174 to 181 residues in the wild-type but in the mutants that correlated pattern was discerned to be oppositely altered as slightly (residues 161 to 168) or moderately (174 to 181 residues) anti-correlated manner. The overall scenario of motion specifies that these three missense mutants can adversely affect DHFR native structure and functions.
3.6.5. Principle Component Analysis (PCA)

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was performed considering Cα atoms of protein in order to present the most active motion of atom in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvectors, calculated based on the construction of the diagonal covariance matrix of the Cα atoms of protein, present the atomic motion and eigenvalue reflects atomic contribution in the motion. The percentages of total variances of motion for the first PCs (PC1) were different for wild (26.14%), R71T (10.60%), G118D (9.70%) and Y122D (8.29%). In addition, the value of total variance of all PCs in wild and variant R71T was almost similar (~63%), indicating that both structures have similar motion. The scores for the total variance for G118D and Y122D were 64% and 62%, respectively ( Fig. 8 ). Therefore, based on the comparison of the scores of the total variances with respect to the wild structure, G118D is deemed to have increased the motion of the protein.

The motion of the wild type and variant proteins was pictured by utilizing projections of the trajectories in phase spaces for the PC1 and PC2 ( Fig. 8 ). The projections for PC1 and PC2 indicated noticeable changes in the protein conformation. All variants showed different conformation and more occupation in phase spaces as compared to the wild type indicating greater flexibilities of variant structures as compared to the wild type DHFR, which was consistent with the result of the RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and number of hydrogen bond analysis.
4. Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover structural and functional consequences of nsSNPs in DHFR using a broad range of recently developed in silico tools. Among the 12 deleterious mutations, three nsSNPs (R71T, G118D and Y122D) have been confirmed to be directly associated with the co-factor and ligand binding active sites. Despite significant roles of DHFR protein in folate metabolism and DNA synthesis , a few experimental works on single nucleotide polymorphism have been done so far ( Mishra et al., 2007 , Koç and Akar, 2009 , Goto et al., 2001 ). In addition, DHFR enzyme is an attractive pharmaceutical target for cancer treatment since its pivotal role is DNA precursor synthesis ( Li et al., 2000 ). Considering its importance, we performed an extensive in silico study to investigate the functional and structural impact on DHFR protein due to its natural non-synonymous SNPs.

A combination of multiple algorithms, consisting of sequence homology-, sequence structure- and machine learning- based tools have been used in this study, to acquire the most reliable and accurate prediction as also recommended by ( Yazar and Özbek, 2021 ). In our present study, out of the 8160 SNPs, there were 98 missense mutations in DHFR where ten tools were used as in silico predictors. Twelve non-synonymous mutations were the most deleterious for the normal function and structural stability of the DHFR protein as supported by the 10 out of 10 tools ( Table 1 ). DHFR mutational changes have previously been reported to be linked with clinical complications such as megaloblastic anemia ( Cario et al., 2011 ), pancytopenia ( Acharya et al., 2020 ) and even folate deficiency ( Banka et al., 2011 ). Moreover, resistance to anti-cancer drug methotrexate occur due to mutations in the active site of DHFR ( Mishra et al., 2007 , Yu and Zhou, 2020 ).

Numerous studies revealed that SNPs are associated with phenotypic variation such as altered response to drug treatment, besides susceptibility to disease ( Giacomini et al., 2007 , Voisey and Morris, 2008 ). Hence, linking the structural properties of non-synonymous SNPs to functional outcomes is a major issue in structural bioinformatics . The SNPeffect 4.0 which integrates TANGO, WALTZ, LIMBO and FoldX have been used to investigate the structural phenotypes of the most deleterious 12 mutants ( Table 2 ). Among them, based on LIMBO analysis, G118D is predicted to decrease the aggregation tendency and increase the amyloid propensity to DHFR protein. In addition, V113F is predicted to decrease the chaperon binding tendency. Besides, nine nsSNPs affect the adverse effects and the stability of DHFR protein; among them Y122D is predicted to severely reduce the stability ( Table 2 ). To our knowledge, there is no experimental evidence of these mutations conferring the said phenotypic effects.

The degree of evolutionary conservation of an amino acid in a protein reflects a balance between its natural tendency to mutate and the overall need to retain the structural integrity and function of the macromolecule ( Sniegowski et al., 2000 ). According to our ConSurf analysis, the human DHFR is highly conserved over generations with 10 out of 12 deleterious mutant positions were present in a highly conserved area ( Fig. 4 and Table 3 ) thus confirming the importance of these native amino acids in retaining the normal structure and/or function.

Interestingly, among the 12 deleterious nsSNPs, three mutants (R71T, G118D and Y122D) lied in the active site of DHFR ( Rana et al., 2020 , Gorse and Gready, 1997 ). Hence, MD simulations were conducted under physiological conditions for these three mutants for comparison with the wild type ( Fig. 5 , Fig. 6 , Fig. 7 , Fig. 8 ) in order to explain their impacts on the structural stability, computationally. Subsequently, RMSD, RMSF, Rg , H-bonds and SASA analyses clearly confirmed their impacts on the structural stability and residual fluctuations. All of the three variants, especially Y122D, showed maximum disability and residual deviations when compared to the wild-type DHFR ( Figs. 5 and 6 ) which is strongly correlated with our algorithmic findings ( Table 1 and 2 ).

Since human DHFR is involved in the DNA precursor synthesis and is a therapeutic target for cancer treatment; a comprehensive study such as ours is highly required to unveil the deleterious nsSNPs which are critical for losing its native functions. Nevertheless, our study has some limitations. For example, the MD simulation time can be lengthened to garner more reliable information on the mutants’ effects as compared to the native type. Last but not the least, a molecular docking study of the damaging variants with co-factors or ligands can be added to understand the effects on binding affinities . Undoubtedly, experimental validation is the most important aspect of confirming the assessment of the effects of these nsSNPs. Therefore, in vitro and/or in vivo experimental validation can be performed to uncover how these mutations disrupt the native structure and functions of DHFR protein.
5. Conclusion

Using a broad range of recently developed in silico tools, 12 deleterious variants that may interrupt the structural stability of DHFR protein and consequently its normal functions have been detected. Among the 12 deleterious mutations, three nsSNPs (R71T, G118D and Y122D) are directly associated with the co-factor and ligand binding active sites. Our molecular dynamics simulation study also confirmed the structural disruptions due to these mutations compared to the native structure.
