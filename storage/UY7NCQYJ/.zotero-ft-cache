SUMMARY
Although protein design has been used to introduce new functions, designed variants generally only function as well as natural proteins after rounds of laboratory evolution. One possibility for this pattern is that designed mutants frequently sample nonfunctional conformations. To test this idea, we exploited advances in multiconformer modeling of room-temperature X-ray data collection on redesigned ubiquitin variants selected for increasing binding afﬁnity to the deubiquitinase USP7. Initial core mutations disrupt natural packing and lead to increased ﬂexibility. Additional, experimentally selected mutations quenched conformational heterogeneity through new stabilizing interactions. Stabilizing interactions, such as cation-pi stacking and ordered waters, which are not included in standard protein design energy functions, can create speciﬁc interactions that have long-range effects on ﬂexibility across the protein. Our results suggest that increasing ﬂexibility may be a useful strategy to escape local minima during initial directed evolution and protein design steps when creating new functions.
INTRODUCTION
One of the major aims of both protein engineering and computational design is to create proteins with new or enhanced functions (Butterfoss and Kuhlman, 2006). Proteins can be redesigned to promote new catalytic reactions or, in the simpler case, for binding to new partners. Recent years have seen successes including the design of new enzymes (Kiss et al., 2013), new small-molecule binders (Tinberg et al., 2013), and new proteinprotein interfaces (Karanicolas et al., 2011). However, these redesigned proteins are generally optimized with many rounds of laboratory evolution to achieve functions approaching those of natural systems (Blomberg et al., 2013; Khersonsky et al.,

2010). There are several ways that the engineering or design process can fall short of optimal function: the protein may not fold in the conformation predicted; the intended structure may not imbue the desired function; or the protein may dominantly populate nonfunctional conformations. We (Bhabha et al., 2015), and others (Korendovych and DeGrado, 2014; Osuna et al., 2015), have speculated that the third explanation is a major reason why redesigned proteins are only marginally functional initially. The hypothesis is that initial mutations introduced during redesign disrupt the native packing of the parental wild-type (WT) protein, resulting in increased ﬂexibility and sampling of nonfunctional conformations.
To improve function, subsequent directed evolution experiments ﬁx mutations that act to stabilize the functionally important conformations found in the broadened ensemble of the redesigned protein (Frushicheva et al., 2014). This pattern of design and selection has been performed for functions including small-molecule binding (Tinberg et al., 2013) and protein-protein interaction (Karanicolas et al., 2011), the most developed examples of directed evolution changing dynamics and function that have emerged from enzyme design. Molecular dynamics simulations of designed enzymes indicate that initial designs suffer from poor preorganization (Frushicheva et al., 2010) and that mutations acquired during further selections reduce conformational dynamics near the active site (Osuna et al., 2015). Molecular dynamics simulations have also been used as a computational ﬁlter to screen out designs that suffer from conformational instability (Wijma et al., 2015). In principle, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods could be used to assess whether local dynamics are altered from WT by redesign and subsequent evolution (Johnson and Handel, 1999; Walsh et al., 2001). However, it has remained difﬁcult to track changes in conformational heterogeneity during these processes because of the inability to resolve the relevant conformations in atomic detail for proteins that select for new binding or catalytic activities.
To overcome these limitations, X-ray crystallographic techniques to resolve alternative conformations with atomic resolution have recently been developed (Burnley et al., 2012; Keedy et al., 2015). The key insight enabling these techniques is the recognition that weak signals present in electron density maps represent alternative conformations (Lang et al., 2010, 2014).

These signals can be interpreted with a multiconformer model whereby individual residues are built as a parsimonious set of alternative conformations with differing coordinates, occupancies, and B factors (Woldeyes et al., 2014). These features are often more noticeable in X-ray data collected at room temperature. Interpreting these signals in systems such as CypA (Fraser et al., 2009), Ras (Fraser et al., 2011), and DHFR (van den Bedem et al., 2013), has delivered new insights into the structural basis of correlated protein dynamics and their relationship to function. By monitoring differences in multiconformer models, it should be possible to observe how conformational heterogeneity changes as a function of redesign and laboratory evolution for novel enzymatic or binding activities. Here we investigated the changes to conformational heterogeneity of ubiquitin variants selected to bind tightly and speciﬁcally to the deubiquitinase, ubiquitin-speciﬁc protease 7 (USP7), also known as HAUSP in humans (Zhang et al., 2013).
Ubiquitin is a hub protein that binds partners with several different interfaces (Husnjak and Dikic, 2012). Previous studies have linked the conformational ﬂexibility of ubiquitin, particularly in the b1b2 loop, to its ability to bind these diverse binding partners (Lange et al., 2008). Unlike the enzyme design examples discussed above, USP7 is already a natural, albeit weak, binder of WT ubiquitin. Zhang et al. (2013) subjected ubiquitin to a com-

bination of Rosetta design and phage display to encode additional afﬁnity and speciﬁcity for USP7. The premise of the project was to mutate the core of ubiquitin to stabilize the ‘‘down’’ conformation of the b1b2 loop. An initial mutant was selected from a phage display library of seven sites selected based on Rosetta Design calculations. Originally referred to as u7ub25, this mutant is referred to herein as the ‘‘core’’ mutant. The ﬁnal ‘‘afﬁnity-matured’’ mutant, originally called u7ub25_2540, contains an additional three surface mutations that were selected by additional phage display experiments (Figure 1). While structures of the variants bound to USP7 have not been possible to obtain, we reasoned that the structural and dynamic features of the unbound variants could provide new insights into the forces that stabilize binding. Here, we determined the structures of both the core and afﬁnity-matured variants to high resolution using room-temperature X-ray diffraction. The structure of the afﬁnity-matured variant showed that the b1b2 loop adopted the same ‘‘up’’ conformation as WT ubiquitin (Zhang et al., 2013), and as the minor conformer of the core mutant. Thus, the mechanism by which these mutations lead to increased speciﬁcity remains unclear. We found that the heterogeneity of these mutants follow a trend whereby the initial mutations lead to increased ﬂexibility when compared with previously determined WT ubiquitin crystal structures in different crystal forms, and that the ﬁnal mutations then stabilize a dominant conformation. Our results show how characterizing the conformational landscapes of redesigned proteins could improve protein engineering and computational protein design.
RESULTS
Conformational Heterogeneity of the b1b2 Loop During initial reﬁnement and model building (Tables 1 and 2), we noticed electron density clearly motivating the need for multiconformer models (Figure 2A). For example, the b1b2 loop displays many large difference density features that cannot all be accounted for by a single conformer model with isotropic B factors (Figure 2A), or even with anisotropic B factors. In fact, if added ﬁrst, the anisotropic B factors can spread into the difference signal for alternative conformations, making the density much more difﬁcult to interpret. Therefore, we chose to model alternative conformations ﬁrst, then add anisotropic B factors if necessary. In an initial attempt to build a multiconformer model, we used the automated program qFit (Keedy et al., 2015; van den Bedem et al., 2009), which builds multiconformer models via a ‘‘sample-and-select’’ procedure. While qFit has been recently updated to accommodate more backbone ﬂexibility (Keedy et al., 2015), it was not intended to model large displacements with separated backbone density peaks. Consequently, qFit is not able to model highly ﬂexible areas, such as this b1b2 loop (Figure 2B). For some residues, such as Phe7 in the core mutant, side chains are even moved by qFit into density that is unlikely to arise from that residue. Clearly the complex backbone shifts in this region are not well captured by these automated techniques.
Due to the limitations of automated model building for this region, we undertook extensive manual interpretation of these regions with alternative conformations. To ensure that the resultant manually built models were consistent with the data, we

performed two independent interpretations of the electron density maps (by J.T.B. and M.C.T., blinded from each other). The approach of comparing independent reﬁnements has been previously used to assess the accuracy of structure determination under different puriﬁcations (Daopin et al., 1994), with different reﬁnement software (Fields et al., 1994), and with the same data (Terwilliger et al., 2007). Although modeling alternative conformations at low signal levels is necessary to successfully interpret and minimize the local difference density, care must be taken not to interpret signal unless there is a stereochemically reasonable model that can be built (Richardson et al., 2013). The independent reﬁnement procedure allowed us to check for consistent interpretation in regions of high disorder, such as the b1b2 loop, where relevant signals for alternative conformations frequently appear only at low electron density contour levels. The resulting models were almost identical, essentially varying only in the interpretation of rotamers for ﬂexible side chains. For residues that had different rotamers or varied in number of conformations modeled (Figure S1), we evaluated the two models based on rotameric positions, steric clashes, plausible tertiary interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds to nearby side-chain heteroatoms), consistency with the 2Fo-Fc map, and the extent to which local Fo-Fc difference density was explained. After making a consensus model based on these comparisons, we added anisotropic B factors to protein atoms and ﬁnalized the solvent placement. These additions improved the map quality, allowing extra signal for other features to be interpreted in the ﬁnal model (Figure 2D). In the area of the b1b2 loop, the signal at the high and low contour levels clearly deﬁnes the molecular envelope, and the difference density in this region is largely

reduced (Figure 2D). When the ﬁnal structure is overlaid with the difference density from the single conformer structure (Figure 2C), the new additional conformations clearly explain the previous difference peaks.
The heterogeneity of the b1b2 loop consists of large shifts of the Ca atoms, separating alternative states by as much as 4.5 A˚ . Alternative conformations of backbone carbonyls are observed pointing in different orientations and the backbone takes two distinct paths for residues 9–11. These loop conformations differ from the expected conformations contained in NMR models of the WT protein (Figure 3C), in which the b1b2 loop moves in a hinge-like manner, with residues 8–10 moving in unison between ‘‘up’’ and ‘‘down’’ conformations (Lange et al., 2008).
In contrast to the core mutant (Figure 3A), the electron density for the afﬁnity matured mutant is consistent with a much less heterogeneous conformational ensemble (Figures 3B and S2). Although the afﬁnity-matured conformation is closer to the WT ‘‘up’’ conformation of previous crystal structures than the USP7-bound ‘‘down’’ conformation (Figure 3D), it is a more potent and selective binder than either the core mutant or WT (Zhang et al., 2013). Because the crystallization conditions and other considerations such as crystal lattice contacts and data collection temperature are equivalent between these two datasets, our results indicate that the addition of the ﬁnal three surface mutations in the afﬁnity-matured mutant are responsible for quenching this heterogeneity. Below we outline how speciﬁc mutations have acted to increase conformational heterogeneity from the WT to the core mutant and to decrease heterogeneity from the core to afﬁnity-matured mutants.

Structural Changes of Mutations in and near the b1b2 Loop The core variant has six mutations that were introduced with the goal of increasing the afﬁnity to USP7, by changing the packing of the protein core to favor the ‘‘down’’ conformation of the b1b2 loop. Two of the mutations are on the b1b2 loop, namely T7F and L8R, which both mutate the side chains adjacent to the USP7

binding interface. Three of the other mutations are located in the core of the protein (I13Y, E34L, and L69G) and the ﬁnal mutation, L71R, is on the edge of the hydrophobic core on the C terminus.
Many of the mutations made in the core variant are adjacent to each other, leading to compensatory effects on packing. At the base of b1b2 loop the WT Thr7 is replaced by a bulkier Phe

This shows how the newly built heterogeneity corresponds to the major difference peaks in the original map. (D) The ﬁnal manually built model with corresponding maps.

residue, which is then compensated by a large-to-small mutation (L69G) on the adjacent b5 strand (Figures 4A and 4B). While steric packing is conserved, T7F can no longer make hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of Lys11 or to the side chain of Thr9. Both residues that previously participated in hydrogen bonds in the WT background show enhanced heterogeneity in the core mutant, as seen for the Lys11-carbonyl (Figure 4B). For residue Thr9, the lack of a hydrogen bond allows the threonine side chain to ﬂip out relative to the WT conformation (Figures 4A and 4B). The lack of a side chain at residue 69 (L69G) removes packing interactions with residue 7 (T7F), leading to dramatically shifted conformations of Phe7 visible in the electron density. Collectively, these features likely stabilize the b1b2 loop in WT ubiquitin, and their absence correlates with the increased heterogeneity of the core mutant.
The afﬁnity matured mutant has three additional mutations (R42W, Q49R, and H68R). H68R sits on the ﬁnal b strand directly adjacent to the b1b2 loop. A bridging water molecule links the carbonyl oxygen of Lys6 and the histidine side chain of residue 68 in the core mutant. This bridging water molecule is modeled in multiple previously determined WT ubiquitin crystal structures (PDB: 3ons and 1yiw) and there is a corresponding unmodeled electron density peak in the original WT ubiquitin dataset (PDB: 1ubq) (Figure S3). In the ﬁnal afﬁnity-matured mutant this water-mediated interaction is replaced by a direct hydrogen bond between the introduced arginine side chain and the Lys6 carbonyl directly, stabilizing the loop in one conformation (Figures 4C–4E).
Conformational Heterogeneity Is Reduced in AfﬁnityMatured a1b3 Loop and C Terminus Two regions adjacent to the b1b2 loop also follow the same trend as the loop itself, displaying increased heterogeneity

from the WT to the core mutant and decreased heterogeneity from the core to afﬁnity-matured mutants. The ﬁrst of these areas that display heterogeneity in the core mutant is the C-terminal tail (residues 73–76), which is disordered in the electron density map of the core mutant. The density for L71R, one of the core mutations located just before the C terminus, is not observable for the side chain beyond Cb, but is ordered in the afﬁnity-matured structure. In the afﬁnity-matured mutant, two of the three new mutations are involved in a new interaction with the C terminus. The R42W and Q49R mutations create a cation-pi-cation stacking interaction with R72 (Figures 5A– 5C). This interaction further links the C terminus to the other b strands of the protein, ordering residue 72 near the C terminus.
A second area that displays signiﬁcant conformational heterogeneity in the core mutant, but not in the afﬁnity-matured mutant, is the loop region between the a1 helix and the b3 strand (residues 32–41). In this loop the backbone displays heterogeneity where alternative conformations are shifted by a 1.0–2.2 A, resulting from a subtle hinging at the ends of the loop (Figure 5D). In the most shifted region in the loop, the Asp39 backbone carbonyl, the density has two discrete peaks corresponding to two states, rather than a smooth continuum that could be modeled by a single conformation with an anisotropic B factor. Within the a1b3 loop, we observe another pair of compensatory mutations for residues 13 (I13Y) and 34 (E34L) in the core mutant. Speciﬁcally, Tyr13 buries Leu34 (Figure S4), maintaining the interaction between aliphatic groups at these side-chain positions. The hydrophilic hydroxyl group in Tyr13 is also retained in a nearly equivalent position to the carboxyl group of Glu34 in the WT protein. Although side-chain interactions appear to be maintained, this new interaction coincides with increased mobility of the a1b3 loop. Subtle differences in packing that

result from these amino acid substitutions, and concomitant changes to adjacent residues, may introduce ﬂexibility in this region. In contrast to the core mutant, the a1b3 loop in the afﬁnity-matured mutant does not display signiﬁcant heterogeneity (Figure 5E). Although none of the afﬁnity-matured mutations are in this exact region, it is likely that the additional stabilization of the C terminus gained from the new cation-pi-cation interaction between residues W42, R49, and R71 in the afﬁnity-matured mutant propagates to the a1b3 loop via backbone interactions. Notably, a network of hydrogen bonds connects residues 40 and 41 of the a1b3 loop with residues 70 and 72 of the C terminus. We therefore hypothesize that the new interactions observed in the afﬁnity-matured mutant cooperate with native hydrogen bonding motifs to quench the dynamics of the a1b3 loop.
Both States of Residue Asp52-Gly53 Peptide Flip Occur in Core and Afﬁnity-Matured Structures Residues Asp52 and Gly53 have been previously identiﬁed as a structural switch in ubiquitin that undergoes a discrete peptide ﬂip (Huang et al., 2011) which exchanges on the microsecond timescale (Sidhu et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2016). The original crystal structure of WT ubiquitin (1ubq), a standard in computational benchmarking studies, shows the peptide in the ‘‘NH-out’’ state with the Asp52 carbonyl making a hydrogen bond to the backbone of the a1 helix starting at residue Glu24. In the crystal structure (3ons) from conditions similar to those used for solidstate NMR the ‘‘NH-in’’ state is seen, where the Glu24 side chain is swung down relative to the NH-out conformation to make a hydrogen bond with the Glu24 backbone and the G53 NH group. This observation has provided a structural rationale for slow NMR dynamics measurements in solution (Majumdar and Ghose, 2004; Massi et al., 2005) and in solid state (Tollinger et al., 2012): the chemical shifts of backbone amides surround-

ing residue 24 are perturbed as the side chain transitions to a new rotamer. Moreover, this ﬂip is thought to be a key structural switch between different states of ubiquitin. The ﬂip state of the peptide can be predicted from the backbone coordinates of other residues across the entire protein (Smith et al., 2016). The major conformation in both of our structures corresponds to the NH-in conformation found in the 3ons structure. When modeling this region as a single conformer, we observed signals in the Fo-Fc map supporting an alternative conformation corresponding to the NH-out state (Figure 6A). In our ﬁnal model, the peptide ﬂip is modeled in both states (Figure 6B) for both structures at occupancies of 60%–70% for the major NH-in and 30%–40% for the NH-out. Interestingly, the NH-in state has been implicated in the binding mode of ubiquitin to the USP class of deubiquitinases which includes the target, USP7 (Smith et al., 2016). While the population of the NH-in state may have been increased relative to WT, it remains surprising that both peptide ﬂip states are observed in our structures, given the strong association of this peptide ﬂip with the binding of USP7. These structures indicate that it is possible for both of these states to exist within the same crystal form, and provide an additional example of how multiconformer X-ray models can be used to provide a structural basis for dynamics observed by NMR.
DISCUSSION
We have structurally characterized two ubiquitin variants created via a combination of computational protein design calculations and phage display. These variants are poorly modeled by traditional single conformer models, or even with existing automated model-building tools for regions of high heterogeneity. Enabled by room-temperature X-ray data collection and manually built multiconformer models, we have described the emergence and quenching of conformational heterogeneity along a protein design and engineering trajectory. From these multiconformer models, we observed the interplay of computational protein

Gray dashed lines show hydrogen bonds existent in WT ubiquitin between residues 7, 9, and 11. Sticks are shown for the side chains of residues 7 and 9, as well as for the backbone of residue 11. (B) Both conformations of the residues shown in (A) are shown for the core mutant. Mutated residues are colored in a lighter blue. The Ca of Gly69 is shown as a small sphere for clarity. (C–E) Interactions between residue 6 of b-strand 1 and residue 68 of strand 5 for the WT ubiquitin (gray, C), the core mutant (blue, D), and the afﬁnity-matured mutant (green, E). A modeled water appears linking the backbone of residue 6 with the histidine 68 side chain in both the core mutant and WT (PDB: 3ons). This interaction is directly replaced in the afﬁnity-matured mutant by a hydrogen bond between the new arginine side chain and the backbone carbonyl of residue 6. See also Figure S3.

design and laboratory evolution, describing both the core and afﬁnity-matured mutants that were developed to bind tightly to USP7. Notably, the intermediate core mutant displayed signiﬁcant conformational heterogeneity across the majority of the protein, varying in magnitude. The large-scale backbone motions of the b1b2 loop are in direct contrast to the original goal of stabilizing a single pro-USP7 binding conformation. Instead, the core mutations enhance the ﬂexibility of the protein, creating b1b2 loop conformations that are distinct from states in the hinge-like motion predicted by NMR analyses of the WT protein (Lange et al., 2008). In contrast, additional surface mutations introduced in the ﬁnal afﬁnity-matured mutant cooperate to reduce ﬂexibility, and the b1b2 loop can be modeled in a single conformation.
Our observations suggest that the process of rational protein design followed by directed evolution resembles simulated annealing procedures used to escape local conformational minima in X-ray reﬁnement (Bru€nger et al., 1997; Korostelev et al., 2002). For these ubiquitin variants, the core mutations, selected based on Rosetta calculations and phage display, act like the heating step. These mutations disrupt the natural dynamics and packing of the WT protein, creating a large and diverse ensemble of states. Relative to the initial WT conformation, these dynamics

likely increase the sampling of states that have the desired function; however, many undesirable conformations are also sampled. Further afﬁnity maturation acts like the cooling step in simulated annealing, selectively stabilizing the functional states. This ﬁnal pattern of ﬂexibility changes is similar to what has been hypothesized for designed enzymes subjected to directed evolution (Bhabha et al., 2015; Kiss et al., 2013) and observed in antibody maturation (Adhikary et al., 2015; Jimenez et al., 2004). The discordant mapping between the conformational landscape, which is most heterogeneous in the ‘‘core’’ mutant, and functional landscape, which shows the largest functional gain from the initial ‘‘core’’ phage display, demonstrates the complex interplay between conformational dynamics and function. Although our observations are made in the context of the evolution of new binding speciﬁcity, they can likely be translated to the more complicated challenge of evolving new catalytic activities (Campbell et al., 2016).
The ability for proteins to evolve new functions in this way relies on the fact that the hydrophobic cores of most proteins can accommodate many alternative sequences without compromising stability (Lim and Sauer, 1989). This permissiveness can be exploited to alter functional speciﬁcity (Koulechova et al., 2015). Here, we observed how changes in side-chain packing

(A–C) The packing of residues 42, 49, and 72 is shown. Panels and colors show the WT, core, and afﬁnity-matured mutants in gray, blue, and green, respectively.
Once mutated, residues are shown in a lighter shade of the same color. Residue Arg72 could not be fully built in the core mutant model and thus is truncated at the Cb. Residues mutated in the afﬁnity-matured protein now show new cation-pi interactions, both between residues 72 and 42 and between residues 42 and 49. (D) Residues 36–39 are shown, highlighting heterogeneity in the afﬁnity-matured mutant that spans residues 32–41. There is signal for two conformations that differ in this region by a shift of as much as 2.2 A˚ . 2Fo-Fc map shown as a volume contoured to 3.5, 1.5, and 0.65 eA˚ À3 (light blue, blue, and black), with the difference Fo-Fc map contoured to 3 eA˚ À3.

between mutations in direct contact can lead to dramatic changes in backbone ﬂexibility. Therefore, core mutations, even with multiple compensatory mutations, can disrupt the natural dynamic packing and may increase backbone ﬂexibility. These changes lead to altered dynamics, which can be exploited for evolving new functions. The nearly global quenching of backbone heterogeneity in the afﬁnity-matured mutant, both in regions directly adjacent to mutations and across the protein, point to the importance of the cooperativity in these dynamic packing interactions.
Surprisingly, the reduced dynamics in the afﬁnity-matured variant are enabled by introduction of new surface interactions, including a cation-pi-cation interaction observed between residues Arg72, Trp42, and Arg49. These new side chains apparently cooperate to ‘‘freeze’’ motion on the backbone behind these new interactions. The importance of this cation-pi-cation motif in this structure suggests possibilities to improve rational design of new or altered protein function by incorporating rarer interactions in the design process. Despite efforts to develop potentials for cation-pi interactions in Rosetta (Misura et al., 2004), they are not currently modeled in the standard Rosetta energy function and thus would be completely missed in the design process. Cation-pi interactions have recently been used to stabilize a miniature designed protein (Craven et al., 2016) and are com-

mon in naturally occurring proteins (Dougherty, 2013). In addition, ordered waters, which are not directly accounted for by Rosetta (Jiang et al., 2005), play a key role in the stabilization of hydrogen bond networks such as between the WT His68 and the b1b2 loop. These overlooked features of protein structure play key roles in conformational stabilization and could be incorporated to improve the protein design process.
Interestingly, despite the dramatic increase in afﬁnity for the binding partner USP7, the b1b2 loop in our apo-crystal structures does not adopt the ‘‘down’’ conformation seen in the WT ubiquitin USP7 complex. Instead, the afﬁnity-matured loop state resembles the WT apo ‘‘up’’ state (Figure 3D). It is unclear whether the ‘‘down’’ conformation is stabilized by these mutations, albeit still as a minor conformation that cannot be detected crystallographically. Rather than disrupting the dynamics of the b1b2 loop in such a way that the ‘‘down’’ state is the only state accessed, one explanation for the enhanced afﬁnity to USP7 may be that the mutations introduced key interfacial residues that produce a more complementary surface to the large binding cleft of USP7. Alternatively, the mutations may reduce the energetic penalty for reorganizing into the bound conformation in an induced ﬁt mechanism. Repeated attempts to cocrystallize mutant ubiquitins with USP7 have not been successful. However, when our model is docked into holo-USP7 crystal

structures it has signiﬁcant clashes, similar to docking a WT apoubiquitin crystal structure into this pocket (Figure 7). Interestingly, the pattern of clashes changes, with new clashes appearing near the b1b2 loop (residues Tyr13 and Thr14) and for residues Lys33, 47–49, and Gln62. Also, the residues involved in the newly introduced cation-pi interaction show clashes when docked into USP7. The pattern of clashes also changes when docked into an apo crystal structure of USP7 without a ubiquitin in the binding site. Most notably there is a shift of clashes in the region of the b1and b2 strands, shifting from residues Tyr13 and Thr14 to Thr12, Phe4, and the side chain of Glu64 (Figure 7), which is likely a result of the clam-shell shift of USP7 when binding to its partner. Collectively, these clashes argue against the ubiquitin mutants targeting the apo-like state of USP7. We speculate that the afﬁnity-matured mutant also un-

dergoes rearrangement with USP7 upon binding, similar to what is seen based on WT crystal structures. Zhang et al. (2013) showed that while the speciﬁcity for the afﬁnity-matured mutant was mostly speciﬁc to just USP7, the additional deletion of the two C-terminal glycine residues was necessary to obtain speciﬁcity over USP5. The C terminus makes extensive contacts with both USP7 and USP5, suggesting that the speciﬁcity is reliant on the folded part of the domain where new contacts enhance afﬁnity for USP7 over USP5.
Future studies of the core and afﬁnity-matured mutants bound to USP7 are needed to further answer these questions regarding the mechanism whereby these ubiquitin mutants obtained such high afﬁnity for USP7. The relationship between protein function and heterogeneity and dynamics is complex; the creation of new alternative conformations does not necessarily imply reduced

Ub-bound USP7 is shown in cartoon and surface (tan, 1nbf). Clashing atoms between the unbound WT Ub and USP7 are mainly concentrated at the b1b2 loop (top) and shown as spheres, with the remainder of the residue shown as sticks. (B) Afﬁnity-enhanced mutant (green) shown overlaid with bound Ub from the holo USP7 structure. Although contacts are changed at the b1b2 loop (top), additional clashes, indicative of an altered binding mode or receptor accommodation, are spread throughout the protein. An asterisk marks notable changes in clashes between apo and holo USP7 structures. (C) Unbound WT Ub (gray, 1ubq) shown overlaid with the unbound apo-USP7 structure (lighter brown, PDB: 5j7t). Overlay was constructed by alignment of domains to the bound USP7 (1nbf). Increased clashes throughout the protein show the accommodation of the receptor in the holo form. (D) Afﬁnity-matured mutant (green) shown overlaid with the unbound apo-USP7 structure (5j7t). Although clashes are increased in some regions, they are reduced in others, which suggests that the conformational ﬂexibility of the receptor may be exploited by the afﬁnity-matured mutant in the ﬁnal binding pose. An asterisk marks notable changes in clashes between apo and holo USP7 structures.

afﬁnity or performance. A protein’s WT sequence is presumably nearly optimized for ﬁtness and its conformational landscape is sufﬁciently tuned for function. Mutations can therefore introduce extra conformers, which might have a negative impact on ﬁtness; however, these extra conformations can, in rare instances, provide the raw material for functional innovation or specialization. Directed evolution can stabilize the extra states introduced by the mutations selected through protein design, quenching heterogeneity. Given the recent interest in using ubiquitin variants for structural biology chaperones as in vitro modulators of the ubiquitin proteasome system (Canny et al., 2016; Ernst et al., 2013; Gorelik et al., 2016; Phillips et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016), there may be additional opportunities to use these proteins to test these hypotheses and learn about the importance of conformational dynamics in protein function (Phillips et al., 2013). Experimentally characterizing nearly iso-energetic states will improve our ability to evaluate the success of the design of protein ensembles. As design challenges move from stabilizing a single state to creating functional cycles, ﬁnding sequences that predictably modulate ﬂexibility or rigidity will become increasingly important.

METHOD DETAILS
Protein Puriﬁcation Protocol adapted from Zhang et al. ((Canny et al., 2016; Ernst et al., 2013; Gorelik et al., 2016; Phillips et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016)) and references therein. Each of the ubiquitin mutants were expressed from a pET derivative vector containing the protein gene with a TEV cleavable N-terminal His6 tag in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown in LB media to an OD600 of 0.6-0.8, and were then induced with 1 mM IPTG at 37 C for 4 hours. Cell pellets were resuspended into 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors.The resuspended pellet was then lysed by EmusiFlex. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm. Supernatant was ﬂowed over a 5 mL Ni-NTA column. Ni-NTA column was washed with 20 mM Tris pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and eluted with 20 mM Tris pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole. Elution was dialyzed into 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and then cleaved with TEV overnight at 4 C. The sample was then loaded back onto a Ni-NTA column, and the ﬂow through was collected. Sample was then concentrated to less than 10 mL and loaded onto a S75 column equilibrated with the previous buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl). Protein concentration of the pooled fractions was assessed after concentration down to 1-2 ml via a BSA assay and monitored during further concentration via absorption. Protein was stored only overnight at 4 C before concentration and use for crystallization.
Crystallization and data Collection Protein solution from was concentrated to 20 mg/ml for the core mutant and 10 mg/ml for the afﬁnity matured mutant. Then 1ul of protein solution was mixed with 1ul of precipitation solution in hanging drop trays. Precipitation solution for core mutant contained 0.1 M citric acid pH 4.6, and 2.6 M ammonium sulfate. For the afﬁnity matured mutant, the precipitation solution contained 0.1 M citric acid pH 4.2, and 2.2 M ammonium sulfate. Crystals formed overnight and grew to full size over the course of several days. Diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Berkeley, CA), beamline 8.3.1.
Optimizing the diffraction Resolution Cutoff After optimizing crystals for the room temperature collection of high resolution datasets for the initial core and the ﬁnal afﬁnity matured mutants, we had to select an appropriate resolution cutoff for our data. Because the ability to detect and faithfully model conformational heterogeneity is resolution dependent, we aimed to push the resolution of our dataset as far as possible. High resolution reﬂections, despite their lower signal-to-noise, can contain meaningful information that can improve the map and model, even past more traditional methods of picking a resolution cutoff. Instead of simply using CC1/2, completeness and I/s, we used the Karplus and Diederichs approach of monitoring Rfree in parallel reﬁnements to determine the optimal resolution cutoff for our datasets (Karplus and Diederichs, 2012). When using parallel reﬁnements to determine the optimal resolution cutoff, additional higher resolution reﬂections are judged to contain meaningful signals only if model agreement increases in lower resolution bins after reﬁnement.
A molecular replacement solution was found with the 1ubq WT ubiquitin model. While, a previous lower resolution structure of the afﬁnity enhanced mutant exists (PDB: 4hk2) this model was solved with a much larger unit cell containing extra non-crystallographic symmetry copies that were not justiﬁed by the diffraction images in our datasets. Due to these complications, we have not focused on comparisons with 4hk2 and restricted our analysis to the (high resolution) room temperature dataset.
For an initial conservative resolution cutoff, we chose 1.16 A˚ as a cutoff to begin our parallel reﬁnement tests, and created additional bins of reﬂections to be added in 0.04 A˚ increments up to a high resolution cutoff of 0.96 A˚ . While a 0.04 A˚ resolution change may seem small, $2000 unique reﬂections are added in each bin. The values for CC1/2 in the high resolution bins remained over 50% up to 1.04 A˚ resolution, while completeness began to drop at resolutions better than 1.12 A˚ (Table 1). To begin the resolution test, ﬁrst we built a single conformer model using the reﬂections up to the ﬁrst cutoff (1.16 A˚ ). We then built alternative conformations into strong difference density signals corresponding to clear alternative conformations. At this point, we added reﬂections from each additional resolution bin ranging from 1.16 A˚ to 0.96 A˚ , and re-reﬁned the model to convergence in parallel reﬁnements. Based on the R-values from these parallel reﬁnements, the determined optimal resolution cutoffs were 1.12 A˚ for the core mutant and 1.08 A˚ for the afﬁnity matured mutant (Tables 1 and 2, Figure S5).
