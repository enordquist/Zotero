Emergent behaviour from electron-transport properties is routinely observed in systems with dimensions approaching the nanoscale1. However, analogous mesoscopic behaviour resulting from ionic transport has so far not been observed, most probably because of bottlenecks in the controlled fabrication of subnanometre nanopores for use in nanoﬂuidics. Here, we report measurements of ionic transport through a single subnanometre pore junction, and the observation of ionic Coulomb blockade: the ionic counterpart of the electronic Coulomb blockade observed for quantum dots. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that nanoscopic, atomically thin pores allow for the exploration of phenomena in ionic transport, and suggest that nanopores may also further our understanding of transport through biological ion channels.
Electrical transport through single molecules has attracted considerable attention2 owing to the possibility of using individual molecules as electronic components3. The first generation of single-
molecule electrical measurements was realized by probing transport
in single quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, C60 molecules and DNA molecules using microfabricated structures, mechanically formed molecular junctions and scanning probe microscopies4.
Such ultra-small platforms oﬀer an ideal toolbox for probing
electrons one at a time through the individual molecules, enabling
direct observation of single-electron phenomena, such as Coulomb blockade, or the Kondo eﬀect5 that have substantially contributed to
our understanding of fundamental quantum physics and might lead
to the realization of diverse quantum devices.
Analogous mesoscopic phenomena have also been predicted for
ionic transport through narrow channels when they approach the dimensions of the hydration layers formed around each ion6,7. At
very low densities one should then observe single-particle step-like
conductance owing to the breaking of hydration layers as a function of channel radius6,7, whereas at larger densities ion–ion interactions
should lead to the equivalent of Coulomb blockade when the channel has the appropriate capacitance6,8. However, owing to the
requirement of controlled sub-nm channels, these phenomena have not been observed so far for ionic transport in nanofluidic systems9.
Instead, ionic transport through nanochannels/nanopores typically
exhibits ohmic behaviour. Voltage-activated nonlinear ion transport
was also observed in various systems, such as hydrophobic wetting and ion dehydration10,11.
Here, we report for the first time the experimental observation
of single-ion transport through the ionic junction of a sub-nm
MoS2 pore. We observe that the current–voltage characteristics of ionic transport show nonlinear behaviour that exhibits a voltage gap
at low applied bias. We suggest a single-ion transport mechanism

based on single-ion charging, where the combination of Coulomb blockade and dehydration determines the ion transport through the sub-nm pore. Our observation is in a good agreement with predictions obtained for both solid-state pores6 and a biological ion channel that has a similar geometry to the sub-nm solid-state nanopore reported here8, and it is reminiscent of the same phenomenon observed in electronic transport through quantum dots.
The experiments are conducted in a typical configuration where the two chambers with ionic solutions are separated by a single nanopore in a single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) membrane12 and biased by a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes, as described in Fig. 1a. The sub-nm nanopores used in this study are produced in a single-layer MoS2 membrane either by our recently reported atomic-scale nanopore fabrication technique using controlled electrochemical reaction or by electron irradiation within a Cs-corrected transmission electron microscope, as described elsewhere12,13. These techniques result in the opening of pores with diameters down to 0.3 nm. From the plethora of twodimensional materials we have chosen 0.65-nm-thick single-layer MoS2 (ref. 12), owing to the fact that it allows better control during nanopore fabrication12,13 and nanopores that exhibit better water transport when compared to graphene14. Fig. 1b shows an image of pristine single-layer MoS2, a sulfur vacancy that acts as an initial site for nanopore formation during electrochemical reaction (Fig. 1c) and a 0.6-nm-diameter nanopore (Fig. 1d). For measurements in this work, we have mostly used pores fabricated using controlled electrochemical reaction13. The electrical characteristics of the pore are then determined by acquiring their current–voltage (I –V ) response in aqueous solutions of salts.
All I –V measurements are performed at room temperature. Fig. 2a shows typical I –V characteristics of a 0.6-nm pore in potassium chloride (KCl) aqueous solutions with a range of ionic strengths (10 mM–4 M). The curves exhibit a striking nonlinear behaviour, with an apparent gap of ∼400 mV. At small voltages, the current is suppressed. When the bias voltage exceeds the threshold value, the current starts to increase more strongly. Corresponding diﬀerential conductance (dI /dV ) plots are shown in Fig. 2b. Zero conductance is found in the gap region, as well as a conductance that increases with applied bias. This phenomenon diﬀers largely from conventional ion transport through nanopores with larger sizes15, which can be described using classical Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations16. Representative I –V curves from larger MoS2 pores (d > 1 nm) are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, exhibiting linear, ohmic responses. The response of another 0.6-nm MoS2 nanopore to diﬀerent ion types is shown in Fig. 3. All tested metal ion types (K+, Na+, Li+, Ca2+, Mg2+) exhibit nonlinearity in their

I –V characteristics (Fig. 3a), with diﬀerent gap sizes for diﬀerent ions and a strong dependence on the valence (referring to the diﬀerential conductance shown in Fig. 3b). Compared to other ions, the I –V characteristic of the divalent ions Mg2+ and Ca2+ shows a more suppressed current for positive voltages than the monovalent ions K+, Na+ and Li+. The hydrophilic nature of MoS2 pores owing to the Mo-rich pore surface and the pore wetting procedure we use, which involves soaking nanopores in an ethanol/water mixture, eliminates the possibility that nonlinearity originates from hydrophobic eﬀects10,17.
To understand the nature of the ionic transport measurements, we first used an analogy to electric transport through a quantum dot/single-molecule system4, shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Here, the small capacitance of a system weakly coupled to electrodes through tunnel junctions gives rise to Coulomb blockade18,19. In the schematics in Fig. 2c,d, and the energy diagrams in Fig. 2e, we attempt to define the ‘electronic structure’ of the single-ion channel device and employ the Coulomb blockade theory for ionic transport. In addition to a resistance, a nanopore junction also has a capacitance. A charging energy then needs to be overcome when

the capacitance of the system is small enough such that many-body ion–ion interaction eﬀects dominate. Therefore, the suppressed conductance in the subthreshold regime is a consequence of the finite energy required to add a charge carrier (ion) to the pore. Referring to the Coulomb blockade model20 this addition energy (∆N+1) is given by

∆N+1 = µN+1 − µN = U + E

(1)

where µN is the electrochemical potential of an N -ion system, U is the Coulomb interaction energy between two ions in the pore and
E is the electronic excitation energy.
The ionic Coulomb interaction can be estimated using the electrostatic self-energy21 by considering a one-dimensional Coulomb gas model of ions22. Following the ionic Coulomb blockade model developed by Kaufman et al.8, the Coulomb gap can be obtained as a function of pore geometry and ion valence8,22,

C, capacitance; R, resistance. e, Equivalent energy-level diagram for ionic Coulomb blockade due to single-ion charging in nanopores. With the sub-nm pore conﬁguration presented, this charging energy is much larger than the thermal energy (kBT), otherwise the ion will be able to pass by means of thermal excitation. Ionic conduction is suppressed (blocked state, left) when the applied bias (eV) is below the charging energy. A build-up in voltage above the charging energy allows conduction (open state, right) with a strong dependence on ion valence number z.

where e is the elementary charge; ε0 is vacuum dielectric constant and εw is the water dielectric constant; C is the geometry-dependent self-capacitance22 of the pore, given by 4εwε0πr2/L; z is the ion valence number; r is the radius of the pore and L is its length.
This model highlights two important contributions that lead to
ionic Coulomb blockade: a geometry-dependent self-capacitance
similar to electronic Coulomb blockade and an ion valence which
is unique in ionic transport. Given the verified thickness of MoS2 nanopores and a 0.6-nm pore diameter, a Coulomb energy of
about 3 kBT for a 0.65-nm theoretical single-layer thickness and 5 kBT for a 1.6-nm hydration thickness12 can be estimated for monovalent ions. For divalent ions, these values rise considerably
to 12 kBT and 20 kBT . A detailed estimation of the Coulomb gap for various pore diameters is given in Supplementary Table 1.
The pore capacitance can also be extracted from the current– molarity relation6. A non-monotonic current–molarity relation is observed, as a direct result of the capacitance eﬀect of the pore6. By fitting to the classical ionic Coulomb blockade model6 using
our device geometry and experimental results presented in Fig. 2,
we obtain a pore capacitance of about 0.2 aF for the 0.6-nm pore,
which is very close to our estimate, as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 3. This non-monotonic behaviour is also predicted where the

self-energy barrier versus concentration also shows a characteristic sharp dip in the vicinity of a certain negative monovalent dopant concentration, explained as a transition between diﬀerent states23. The second eﬀect that contributes directly to the observed energy gap is the dehydration of ions in nanopores smaller than 0.8 nm. This contribution becomes significantly large, and a stepwise free energy barrier originating from successive breaking of the third, second and first hydration shells is introduced when reducing the pore size from 0.8 nm to zero7. Therefore, the dehydration eﬀect should also be incorporated in the energy gap. To this end, we again used an analogy to the combined gap in the single-molecule system and in the ionic case; the ‘energy-level spacing’ is treated using the hydration energy. The estimated contribution from the ionic Coulomb blockade eﬀect and the dehydration eﬀect is shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4, and the Coulomb energy is found to be the main contribution in the pore size range 0.6 to 1 nm. In Supplementary Fig. 4, we hypothesize a transition of the role from dehydration (<0.5 nm) to ion Coulomb blockade (in the range in which we work, 0.6 to 1 nm). The single-particle dehydration eﬀect is thus easily incorporated in the standard model of Coulomb blockade.

This charging energy is much larger than the thermal energy at room temperature (kBT , 298 K), allowing the direct observation of Coulomb blockade in ionic transport at room temperature. An applied bias (eV ) can adjust the chemical potential of the electrode, so as to add or remove a single charge carrier from the pore. When this energy rises above the Coulomb gap, the ion flux is able to pass through the pore. Measured values are in good agreement with the results from the calculations outlined above. A small deviation can be expected, due to the overestimation of the pore size and the additional capacitance between the pore and electrode. The valence dependence, where divalent ions show a slightly larger gap in the positive voltage direction than monovalent ions, is a direct consequence of the stronger Coulomb interaction between divalent ions, as shown in Fig. 3. This suppression is much lower than the straightforward estimation, and we believe that it is due to the combined result of the gap from both divalent cations (Mg2+/Ca2+) and monovalent anions (Cl−). The observed I –V rectification might originate from the dipolar nature of MgCl2/CaCl2 due to the diﬀerence between the transport barrier for divalent cations and monovalent anions. In addition, a similar phenomenon where the self-energy barrier of CaCl2 exhibits the same barrier as Na+ is also theoretically predicted, and explained by the fractionalization of divalent cations (Mg2+/Ca2+) on two unit-charge mobile solitons23.
To observe Coulomb oscillations in most traditional electrical devices20, one would need to incorporate a voltage gate. Nevertheless, integration of the voltage gate in the atomically thick pore requires passivation with a thick layer of dielectric to reduce current crosstalk24. In turn, this requirement would compromise the atomic dimensions of our present nanofluidic device. Alternatively, in nanofluidic devices, gating can be realized by using the pH to modulate the surface charge of the system25. The surface chemistry of the MoS2 nanopore determines the negatively charged surface and an increase in pH will lead to the addition of negative charges. The ionic transport can then be modulated by the surface charge. Figure 4a shows the pH (2.5 to 11) dependence of conduction in our system. A non-monotonic dependence of pore conductance on pH is observed, and conduction peaks are found close to pH 3.5 and pH 6, which correspond to a certain integral number of excess charges in the pore, determined by the surface chemistry. However, the various possibilities of pore chemistry at the single-atom level14 can lead to variations in the conduction peaks from pore to pore, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. Kaufman et al.8 also modelled pore-charge-induced

Coulomb blockade oscillations by approximating the self-energy, Un = Q2n/2C, of excess charge (where Qn represents the excess charge at the pore for the n ions as a function of Qf , Qn = zen + Qf ) and applying Fermi–Dirac occupancy statistics. The blockade region is found around a neutralized excess charge, and barrier-less conduction appears at the crossover point where Un = Un+1, which corresponds to the conductance oscillations we observed at certain pH values.
The Coulomb gap of the single-ion channel can be further engineered by adjusting the pore size. In the absence of the pore, the defect-free membrane is almost insulating, and the leakage current is very low (pA range). The smallest nanopore from a single vacancy with either two sulfur atoms or one molybdenum atom missing would produce a large gap, providing this structure is thermodynamically stable in liquid26. Single vacancies can also be generated using our controlled electrochemical pore fabrication method. However, it is diﬃcult to measure the gap of a single vacancy (d < 3 Å) in practice because a bias voltage higher than 0.8 V can result in the electrochemical dissolution of MoS2. We find only a handful of freestanding, defect-free MoS2 membranes suspended over small windows (<50 nm) that can operate up to 5 V. Supplementary Fig. 6 gives an example of an I –V measurement performed on a 0.3-nm pore. A larger gap of ∼1.2 V is observed, and the voltage is swept in both directions. Cyclic I –V measurements are taken to prevent the enlargement of the existing pore or the formation of a new pore in the presence of a high bias. We suspect the dehydration of a strong second hydration shell also plays an important role here. The measured gap size decreases with increasing pore size, and the charging energy can be obtained directly from the gap. As shown in Fig. 4c–e, a linear transition point is found near 1 nm, indicating the disappearance of the transport barrier, with the I –V characteristic becoming linear after this point. The strong correlation between the nonlinearity of the current– voltage characteristics and the pore dimension further confirms that ionic Coulomb blockade is at the origin of the observed eﬀect. With larger pores, the weak Coulomb interaction could in principle be measured at low temperatures, and even Coulomb stairs might be observed at low voltages. However, operation at low temperatures is limited by the liquid environment itself. Single-step transition from an insulating regime dominated by Coulomb blockade to a semiconducting regime has been observed previously in metallic quantum dots27,28.
The prediction of ion transport through a symmetric biological ion channel has shown Coulomb blockade with a very similar

geometry, pore size of 0.6 nm and thickness of 1.6 nm (ref. 8). The good agreement between the above prediction and experimental results further strengthens our claims. Finally, although Coulomb blockade8 (a many-body eﬀect) is concomitant with the singleparticle dehydration eﬀect7, the following four observations support the contribution from Coulomb blockade: the low capacitance of the experimental configuration, the valence dependence, the peaks in current–molarity relation, and the conductance oscillations from pH-induced surface charge modulation (Supplementary Information, Coulomb blockade discussion).
The observation of unique ionic transport in sub-nm pores is, to our knowledge, the first instance of a quantum-like mesoscopic eﬀect dominating ionic transport. The measured nonlinear current– voltage dependence for individual sub-nm pores is a consequence of single-ion charging behaviour, as described by the ionic Coulomb blockade model8. Other possibilities that may also introduce a transport barrier, such as a dehydration eﬀect, could also be further incorporated in the standard model. Our findings can be applied to nanopores with similar geometries. Our measurements provide direct experimental evidence that the eﬀects observed here should also play a role in the functioning of biological ion channels, such as voltage-gated ion channels, as suggested in the theoretical model proposed by Kaufman and colleagues8. Future experiments investigating various gating eﬀects, combined with better theoretical modelling, are needed to elucidate the results reported here. The blockade region also adds a new dimension to practical applications, such as water desalination29. We believe that atomically thin and small (<1 nm) pores oﬀer a new platform from which to explore novel physics in the research areas of both nanoscale fluidics and biology.

Methods
Nanopore fabrication. The MoS2 nanopores are fabricated either using our recently reported atomic-scale nanopore fabrication technique based on controlled electrochemical reaction (ECR; ref. 13) or using electron irradiation12. Briefly, SiNx membranes (10 µm × 10 µm to 50 µm × 50 µm, 20 nm thick) are manufactured using KOH wet etching. Focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation is applied to drill a 50–300-nm opening on that membrane. CVD-grown single-layer MoS2 (ref. 30) membranes are suspended on the FIB opening by transferring from sapphire substrates using a MoS2 transfer stage. ECR is done by applying a step-like transmembrane potential to the membrane and monitoring the transmembrane ionic current with a FEMTO DLPCA-200 amplifier (FEMTO Messtechnik GmbH). Nanopores are formed under the critical voltage (>0.8 V). The size estimation has an error bar of 0.1 nm with aberration-corrected TEM images and 0.2 nm with ECR pore formation13.
Ionic transport measurement. Ionic transport experiments are performed using the same set-up as described before12,13. After mounting in the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) chamber, the chips were wetted with

H2O:ethanol (1:1) for (30 min–24 h to rule out hydrophobic eﬀects). Ionic transport is performed by taking the current–voltage response (I –V characteristic) of the nanopore in salty solutions (various ion types, ionic concentration or pH) using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices) or a FEMTO DLPCA-200 amplifier for a higher bias than 1 V. A pair of chlorinated Ag/AgCl electrodes is used to apply the voltage and detect the current. Current–voltage measurements (I –V characteristic) are performed by applying an alternating voltage sweep with a step size from 10 to 50 mV and measuring the current (recording frequency 6,250 Hz) at same time. The current at each voltage value is measured for 10 s and the voltage range is typically set to −800 to 800 mV. The I –V curve is then plotted using the voltage values and corresponding fitted steady-state current. The measured error bar is below 1% and therefore not plotted. Crosscheck experiments have been done to make sure the pore is not enlarged.
