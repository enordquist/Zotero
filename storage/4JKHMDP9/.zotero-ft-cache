ABSTRACT: In protein adsorption, the surrounding solvent has an important role in mediating protein−surface interactions. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that the solvent methods employed to model these kinds of processes are able to correctly capture the complex mechanisms occurring in the protein−water-surface interface. Here, we test the suitability of the two most popular implicit solvent methods based on the Generalized Born formalism to describe the adsorption process of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) on a hydrophobic graphene surface. Our results show that in both cases, IgG experiences an extreme and early (in less than 40 ns) unfolding as a result of the adsorption to the surface in contrast with previous experimental ﬁndings. A detailed energy decomposition analysis of explicit and implicit solvent simulations reveals that this discrepancy arises from the ill-characterization of two energy components in implicit solvent methods. These ﬁndings help to elucidate how implicit solvent models may be improved to accurately characterize the protein adsorption process.

1. INTRODUCTION
Protein adsorption has been a subject of great technological and fundamental interest.1,2 Proteins constitute the largest and most widely employed class of biomolecules for surface functionalization. As a result, numerous biotechnology applications such as biocompatible implants, biosensors, and regenerative medicine1,3−5 rely on the process of protein adsorption. This broad applicability has stimulated in the last years the development of many experimental studies addressed to achieve the challenge of visualizing biomolecules and their hydration layers6,7 and controlling how a protein adsorbs to a surface.8−11 However, the protein adsorption mechanism is not completely understood yet.2,12,13 This results from the intrinsic nature of the process, which is driven by the interplay between both enthalpic and entropic forces.1 The former are mostly composed by two components: the protein−surface interaction and the energy change due to protein’s and water’s structural rearrangement arising from its adsorption. The entropic forces, commonly known as hydrophobic forces, are, to a ﬁrst approximation, a measure of how the disruption of the water−solute’s H-bond network induces or prevents the protein from adsorbing. How each of these kinds of interactions (enthalpic/entropic) contributes in the adsorption process is still a very challenging problem that is diﬃcult to solve solely from the experiments. For this reason, atomistic computer simulations, such as classical

molecular dynamics (MD), have turned into an essential tool to shed light on the protein adsorption process. After all, these simulations provide atomistic-level insights into protein− substrate interactions, thus giving a deeper understanding and control on protein adsorption experiments.14,15
In MD simulations of the dynamics of biomolecules, a correct description of the solvent is needed.16 The most direct way to properly account for the interaction between solvent−solute is by explicitly including all the water molecules present on the system. Nevertheless, this comes with a huge computational cost, as it increases the system size by at least 1 order of magnitude. This computational bottleneck has encouraged a fruitful development of a manifold of implicit-solvation methods.17−22 In these methods, the solvent is represented by a continuous medium instead of individual explicit solvent molecules.16 As a result, this class of approximations reduces the number of atoms of the solvated system (i.e., the simulation computational cost) and concurrently keeps a physically accurate description of the biological system of interest.15,23 The suitability and eﬃciency of these methods has long been validated on MD simulations of biomolecules in solution.24−27 However, it is still not clear if they are appropriate for studying

the protein adsorption process.16 In fact, MD simulations of protein adsorption for the same or alike systems have shown qualitatively diﬀerent results depending on the solvent method used. The works that use implicit solvent models28−34 observe a severe degree of unfolding upon protein adsorption, whereas the works that use explicit water35−38 observe the opposite. That diﬀerence seems to point out that the detailed role of the solvent in mediating protein−surface interactions can only be recovered by explicit-solvation methods.25
In this work, we compare the performance of explicit- and implicit-solvation methods to simulate the adsorption process of the immunoglobulin G protein (IgG) on a hydrophobic substrate such as graphene. In a previous work,39 we experimentally validated that the IgG protein remains bioactive upon adsorption and corroborated the compatibility of explicit solvent MD simulation results with that experiments. Here we use two diﬀerent implicit solvent methods (i.e., the HCT40 and OBC41 methods) to simulate the IgG adsorption process on graphene. The results of both simulations clearly show that the IgG denatures upon adsorption, which contrasts with previously reported experimental and explicit solvent results.39 To understand the diﬀerences observed between explicit and implicit solvent results, we also perform a detailed analysis of the evolution of the diﬀerent energy components of the system for both explicit and implicit solvent simulations. This analysis highlights the importance of the entropic eﬀects when a protein adsorbs on a hydrophobic surface and shows the two factors that lead to the unfolding of the protein when implicit solvent is used. First, implicit-solvation methods underestimate the cost of breaking both protein and substrate solvation shells, prompting an instantaneous adsorption process. In addition, as the protein adsorbs, the implicit solvent description of the loss of solute− solvent interaction leads to large electrostatic energy unbalances inside the protein, which causes its unfolding. Therefore, with this work, we pave the way for using implicit-solvation methods to describe the adsorption process of biomolecules as we unravel the characteristics of these methods that must be corrected to that end.
2. SIMULATION METHODS
2.1. System Structure. The protein structure of the IgG, composed of 1316 amino acids and 2 glycan heteropolymer chains, was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 1IGT43). It is composed of four peptide chains (two heavy chains and two light chains, see Figure 1a) arranged in a Y-shape. Protons were added to the protein structure according to the calculated ionization states44 of its titratable groups at a blood pH of 7.4, resulting in a zero net charge. The IgG was then centered on top of a 20 × 20 nm2 two-layer graphene slab with A−B stacking. We have oriented the IgG ﬂat on the surface (Figure 1b,c). The initial distance between the lowest protein atom and the ﬁrst graphene layer was 10 Å (Figure 1b). All graphene atoms were set to be neutral, and the bottom graphene layer of the slab was kept ﬁxed during all simulations. This setup mimics the typical conﬁguration in many adsorption experiments where a graphene layer is supported on an inert, mechanically rigid substrate.
2.2. Force Fields. The protein and the oligosaccharide were modeled by the AMBERﬀ99SB45 and Glycam0446 force ﬁelds, respectively. These force ﬁelds successfully sample the conformational space that an antibody explores in aqueous solution47 and when it is adsorbed to surfaces.39 The carbon atoms of the three-layered graphene were modeled by the OPLS

2.3. Implicit Solvent Methods. For implicit simulations, we have used two diﬀerent methods, HCT40 and OBC,41 both based in the GB/SA formalism. In this formalism, the total solvation free energy of a molecule is given by41

ESOL = ESOL(el) + ESOL(nonel)

(1)

where ESOL(el) accounts for the variation in the electrostatic interaction between the molecule atoms resulting from the

presence of a continuum dielectric solvent, and ESOL(nonel) includes both the solute−solvent vdW interactions and the hydrophobic eﬀects. This second term is deﬁned to be

proportional to the total solvent-accessible surface area (SA) of the molecule (i.e., ESOL(nonel) = γSA).40,41,52,53 As shown later in this work, (Sec 3.2) the contribution of this term to the total
solvent energy is negligible. Considering that, to reduce the simulation cost54 and facilitate the interpretation of the results,

we have not included this term in our implicit solvent

simulations. The ﬁrst term, ESOL(el), is computed using the Generalized
Born (GB) approximation,41 which describes the screening of

the electrostatic interaction of two atoms of the molecule (qi, qj) resulting from the presence of a pure solvent with high dielectric value ϵω (80 for water at 300 K) as

where rij is the distance between atoms i and j, and Ri is the eﬀective Born radii of atom i. This radii reﬂects the degree of burial of the atom i inside the molecule (i.e., the deeper is the
atom inside the molecule, the higher the radii is). Therefore,
according to eq 2, the atoms that are nearer to the molecular surface have a bigger contribution to ESOL(el) than the atoms that are buried inside the molecule.
The diﬀerence between the two implicit solvent models here used is in the eﬀective Born radii deﬁnition. In the HCT model,40 for computing the Born radii, the molecules that constitute the solute are deﬁned as a group of vdW spheres with
dielectric constant unity. The rest of the space (i.e. all the space
that is not occupied by a sphere) has the high dielectric value of the media. The Born radii for each atom is then computed as

(3)

where Hk is the fraction of the eclipsed surface area of a sphere of radius r centered at atom k with vdW radius ρk when it is surrounded by spheres of radius ρk′ at a distance rkk′. In the OBC41 model, the authors changed this original Born radii deﬁnition, because it overestimates the solvation energy for
deeply buried atoms. This overestimation is caused by the presence of artiﬁcial highly dielectric crevices in internal regions
of the solute, in which actually the solvent has been completely expelled.52
2.4. Explicit Solvent Model. For explicit solvent simulations, the TIP3P water model55 has been chosen. This water model not only suitably describes the interaction of water with proteins but also graphene’s wetting properties.30 We have
used periodic boundary conditions with a cubic unit cell that extends 20 Å above/beyond the molecule in the three directions. In order to solvate the system, this unit cell has been ﬁlled up with water molecules, placed in such a way that the minimum solute−water distance is 1 Å. This results in a system composed by ∼450.000 atoms. Note that in the implicit solvent simulations, the system is only composed by ∼60.000 atoms.
2.5. MD Parameters. We used the AMBER12 software suite56 with NVIDIA GPU acceleration.57,58 For explicit solvent simulations, Particle Mesh Ewald59,60 (with a real-space cutoﬀ of
10 Å) was used to account for long-range electrostatic interactions. Van der Waals interactions were truncated at the real-space cutoﬀ. The SHAKE61 algorithm was used to constrain
bonds containing hydrogen atoms, thus allowing us to use an integration time step of 2 fs. Coordinates were saved every 1000
steps. A constant temperature of 300 K was ensured in all the simulations by means of a Langevin thermostat62 with a friction coeﬃcient γ = 1 ps−1. A Berendsen barostat63 with a relaxation
time of tp = 1 ps was used to keep the pressure constant at 1 atm during equilibration of the system to a consistent density value at 300 K. This is a preliminary step in the preparation of our
production constant volume (NVT) simulations. In spite of the
known limitations of this barostat (it suppresses pressure ﬂuctuations more drastically compared to what is expected in the true isobaric−isothermal ensemble), ref 64 shows that it can be eﬃciently used to equilibrate the system density. We have explicitly tested this point by analyzing the density evolution in
that constant pressure (NPT) preliminary stage using the Monte Carlo barostat.65 Figure S1 shows that the diﬀerence between the ﬁnal density values obtained with these two methods is less
than 1%, what reinforces the validity of the Berendsen barostat
for equilibrating the system density.

For implicit solvent simulations, we do not use periodic boundary conditions (i.e. the long-range energetic contributions are not truncated). We also use the SHAKE61 algorithm and keep a constant temperature using a Langevin thermostat62 with the same conditions employed in explicit solvent simulations.
2.6. Protein Adsorption Protocol. Our simulation protocol is composed by three main stages. In the ﬁrst stage, we performed an energy minimization to prevent steric clashes, using a combination of steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods. During this process, we kept weak restraints at the protein backbone and graphene substrate. In the second stage, we heated up the system from 0 to 300 K while restraining the position of the protein backbone and the ﬁrst graphene layer. In the explicit solvent simulation, we use constant pressure conditions (NPT) during this stage. Once these two preliminary stages had been performed, we started with the adsorption process of the protein, in which we let the protein freely adsorb to the substrate. This stage can be divided in three parts. First, we performed a 10 ns simulation, in which the protein is free to adsorb to the nearby substrate. In the explicit solvent simulation, we use volume constant periodic conditions (NVT) during this ﬁrst phase. Next, we performed a steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation to enhance the adsorption process. This SMD process consists of moving toward the surface a selected group of atoms at a constant velocity of 5 Å/ns via a harmonic restrain (with k = 50 kcal/mol). This restrain is only applied to the α-carbons belonging to 16 cysteine residues evenly distributed over the protein. The disulﬁde bonds formed between cysteine residues play an important role in the protein stability. In Figure S2, we show that restraining these Cα atoms does not induce changes in the IgG protein structure. Finally, once the protein has reached the surface, a long MD stage of up to 140 ns in an NVT ensemble was carried out for the explicit solvent simulation. In the case of implicit solvent simulations, the early high degree of unfolding justiﬁed stopping the simulations at 40 ns.
2.7. Data Analysis. In order to characterize the protein− surface adsorption process, we have used the CPPTRAJ tools within the AMBER package.66 We have evaluated the following quantities: root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the protein backbone and domains,66 the evolution of the secondary structure67,68 of the protein, and the evolution of the contactsurface area (CSA) between the protein/substrate. The latter is calculated using the following deﬁnition

CSA(t)

=

1 2 (SAP(t)

SAS(t)

−

SAP−S(t))

(4)

where the time dependent solvent-accessible surface area SA(t)42 was calculated for protein (SAP(t)), substrate (SAS(t)), and protein−substrate (SAP−S(t)).
2.8. Energy Decomposition. As the graphene atoms are
not charged, the only enthalpic interaction between protein and
substrate is the van der Waals interaction (vdW). When we refer
here to van der Waals interaction, we mean the interaction
described by the Lennard-Jones potential, which includes both the van der Waals attractive eﬀects and the Pauli repulsive eﬀects. We computed this interaction energy as a function of
time via an energy decomposition on each frame of our MD trajectories. As a result, the protein−surface interaction is given
by

EtPot−alS(t) = EvPd−WS(t) = EvPd+WS(t) − EvPdW (t) − EvSdW (t) (5)

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Structural Dynamics of the Adsorption Process: Comparison between Diﬀerent Solvent Models. Explicit solvent simulations results (Figures 2a and S3) show that, upon adsorption, the IgG keeps its three-lobe structure, in which each lobe corresponds to a fragment (Fab1/2, Fc). This structure is also clearly distinguished in previously reported AFM experiments of IgG molecules adsorbed over graphene39 (see inset of Figure 2a). Furthermore, these experiments39 show that one of the fragments is slightly higher than the other two. This is reﬂected by a brighter color of one of the lobes on the image

shown in the inset of Figure 2a. This observation is fully consistent with our MD explicit solvent results, as in our simulations, the Fc fragment is slightly higher than the Fab fragments (see side views in Figure S3). Moreover, the interdomain distances obtained in the AFM experiments (i.e., dFab1−Fab2 ≈ 7.8 nm and dFab1−Fc ≈ 6.7 nm) are also in good agreement with explicit solvent MD simulations39 as shown in Figure S4. Everything considered, we may conclude that the IgG adsorbed structure obtained in explicit solvent simulations is in excellent agreement with that obtained in AFM experiments.39
A key point concerning the IgG adsorption to surfaces is whether it preserves its biological functionality (i.e., the ability to bind speciﬁcally to an antigen via the Fab fragments). We have previously conﬁrmed39 that this is the case for IgG adsorbed to graphene via single molecule force spectroscopy experiments. This bioactivity can only occur if and only if the variable region of the Fab fragments preserves its tertiary structure.69 Our explicit solvent simulation results corroborate this, as the relative position of the two chains conforming each Fab fragment is preserved upon adsorption (Figure S3).
In Figure 2b,c, we report the ﬁnal adsorption conﬁgurations obtained for both implicit solvent methods considered here (i.e., HCT40 and OBC).41 Concerning the HCT40 method results (Figure 2b), we may perceive three major structural changes. The ﬁrst is the major unfolding of the Fab fragments, the Fab2 being the most aﬀected. Second, the collapse of the Fc fragment occurs due to the clustering of the glycan chains located in the core of the Fc. The third and last aspect is the clustering of the Fab1 and Fc fragments, most clearly seen in Figure S3, which is driven by a self-interaction of one of the heavy chains of the IgG (shown in opaque red in Figure S3). These three changes of the IgG tertiary structure do not happen when we simulate the dynamics of this protein free in solution using the HCT implicitsolvation method (Figure S5) Considering now the OBC41 results (Figure 2c), we note that the IgG also suﬀers a major unfolding due to adsorption, even more pronounced than the unfolding obtained using the HCT method. The severe loss in the secondary and tertiary structures of Fc and Fab1 fragments leads to a spreading of the IgG over the surface. This is not observed when we simulate the IgG dynamic free in solution using the OBC implicit solvent, as shown in Figure S5 Additionally, as is better shown in Figure S3, the two glycan chains of the Fc fragment separate during the OBC implicit solvent simulation.
Both OBC and HCT structural changes are at odds with the AFM experiments previously mentioned.39 They are unable to reproduce the three-lobe structure and the compact adsorption area of the IgG obtained in AFM experiments39 (Figure S4). In addition, the major degree of unfolding of the Fab fragments observed in both implicit solvent simulations is incompatible with the bioactivity of the IgG observed experimentally.39 This seems to indicate that OBC and HCT implicit methods do not correctly describe the adsorption process of the IgG.
All these structural changes can be quantitatively conﬁrmed by analyzing the evolution of the RMSD deviation of each IgG fragment, which is shown in Figure 2e. Explicit solvent simulations show RMSD values below 5 Å for all fragments, highlighting the strong similarity of the ﬁnal adsorbed conﬁgurations with its crystal structure.43 This is not the case for implicit solvent results, which show for the three fragments larger RMSD values than using explicit solvent. In fact, for both implicit solvent methods, the Fab1 fragment loses more tertiary structure (RMSD ≈ 7 Å) in the initial 10 ns than in 150 ns of the

explicit solvent simulation. Similar processes may be observed in
the other fragments of the molecule, evidencing the striking diﬀerence between implicit and explicit solvent methods in
describing the adsorption process. When comparing OBC41 with HCT40 MD results, we observe
that overall, the former leads to a larger structural change. In
particular, in Figure 2e, we see that the RMSD of Fab1 and Fc is
not stabilized in 40 ns of OBC simulation, indicating that further
unfolding would occur. Furthermore, the RMSD is above 10 Å
for two fragments (Fc, Fab1), which is consistent with the
almost complete loss of its tertiary structure shown in Figure 2c. Considering that the sole diﬀerence between both implicit solvent methods is the electrostatic solvent energy contribution (eq 2), these diﬀerences seems to suggest that the observed
protein unfolding upon adsorption may be related with the
description of that energy component, in particular, with the deﬁnition of the degree of burial41 of the amino acids at the protein−surface interface.
To quantify the loss of protein secondary structure resulting
from the adsorption process, we now analyze the evolution of the β-sheet content (Figure 2d), which is the most abundant
secondary structure in the IgG. The explicit solvent simulations predict a decrease of the β-sheet content below 2%, which is
consistent with the preservation of the functionality of the protein69 reported experimentally. However, implicit solvent simulations predict a β-sheet content decay higher than 10%,
balanced with an increase of the content of random coils (Figure S6). In the ﬁrst 10 ns of implicit solvent MDs, the protein lost more β-sheet content that in 150 ns of explicit solvent simulation. Moreover, when we enhance the adsorption, β-
sheet content decreases even further as a consequence of protein
approaching surface. As can be also observed in the RMSD
evolution, the major structural rearrangement occurring during the adsorption seems to be dramatically promoted in protein−
surface contact regions. This protein-structural instability
promoted by the contact is in agreement with data shown in
Figure S3 and shall be the subject of a thorough discussion in
following subsections. In summary, upon analysis of the tertiary structure, RMSD,
and secondary structure shown in Figure 2, we may conclude
that OBC and HCT methods predict a major structural
rearrangement of the IgG upon adsorption to graphene. This
result is independent of the protein orientation upon the surface,
as we observe a similar structural distortion for another initial protein conﬁguration (Figure S7). Altogether, this is incompatible69 with the preservation of both structural and biofunctionality shown by the experimental observations.39 Therefore, our results ﬁrmly conﬁrm that improvements on OBC and HCT
implicit methods are required in order to correctly describe the
adsorption process of the IgG. 3.2. Eﬀect of the Non-Electrostatic Solvation Con-
tribution (ESOL(nonel)) in the Adsorption Process. In a previous work,70 similar results were found for a completely diﬀerent protein, the bovine serum albumin (BSA). Proteins such as antibodies and serum albumin are diﬀerent in size,
secondary structure composition, and net charge. Despite these diﬀerences, implicit solvent simulations predicted also a major BSA unfolding upon its adsorption,70 contrasting with both explicit solvent simulations70 and recent experimental reports.71
Therefore, the observed IgG unfolding upon adsorption in implicit solvent simulations seems not to be a speciﬁc feature of
this protein but a general characteristic of implicit solvent methods. In ref 70, we speculated that such a degree of unfolding

could be attributed to a strong energy gradient that arises from
an abrupt change of the non-electrostatic solvation contribution
(ESOL(nonel)) when the protein contacts the surface. In what follows, we test the validity of this assumption through a detailed
energy decomposition analysis. In Figure 3a, we plot the energetic change of the protein−
substrate system (ΔET) as a function of the distance between

(a) Change of the total interaction energy (red) with the protein− surface distance (dP−S) using the HCT implicit40 solvent method. The contributions to this change are the protein−substrate interaction (green), the electrostatic solvation contribution (purple), and the nonelectrostatic solvation contribution (inset, in black). The distance dP−S is deﬁned as the z-coordinate of the lowest hydrogen atom of the proline 889, considering that the upper graphene layer is at z = 0.

them (dP−S) using the HCT method (see Figure S8 for OBC results). To compute it, we initially placed the IgG at dP−S ≈ 12.5 Å, and we brought it closer to the surface in steps of 0.1 Å
(Figure 3b). The total energetic change from its initial value (i.e., ET at dP−S ≈ 12.5 Å) is evaluated in all intermediate steps of dP−S. We also compute the diﬀerent contributions to the total energy
change

ΔET = ΔEvPd−WS + ΔESOL(el) + ΔESOL(nonel)

(8)

where EvPdW− S is the graphene−protein van der Waals interaction energy, ESOL(el) is the electrostatic component of the solvation energy (eq 2), and ESOL(nonel) is the non-electrostatic contribution to the solvation energy. In Figure 3a, we observe that the change of the total energy of the system (ΔET) strongly depends on the protein−surface separation. From here on, we shall focus only its evolution at dP−S ≥ 2.5 Å, where the adsorption process is energetically favorable (ΔET < 0). For a
matter of convenience, we shall call this distance range the
adsorption regime. At last, it is important to remark that the coordinates of the protein were kept ﬁxed in all steps (i.e., not
allowing for the structural reorganization of the protein). The protein conﬁguration used is the ﬁnal adsorption conﬁguration
obtained in explicit solvent simulations, as it is the folded conﬁguration that leads to the largest SA change when the
protein contacts the surface.
First we consider the change of the non-electrostatic solvation contribution (ΔESOL(nonel)) as a function of dP−S (inset of Figure 3a). From here, we observe not only that ESOL(nonel) changes

smoothly with dP−S but also its contribution to the total energy change is negligible (i.e., ΔESOL(nonel) = 3.5% ΔET). These two aspects support that ESOL(nonel) plays a minor role, if at all, in the adsorption process. Therefore, this shows that our previous conjecture70 is wrong, as ΔESOL(nonel) alone cannot account for the spurious protein unfolding observed in implicit solvent simulations.34,70 Note that this negligible contribution of

ΔESOL(nonel) to the total energy change happens in a simulation designed to maximize it (i.e., we picked the IgG folded structure

with the largest CSA, which should result in the largest

ΔESOL(nonel) = γ*CSA). We now focus on the change of the other energy components:
EvPd−WS and ESOL(el). First, we consider the van der Waals protein− surface interaction (EvPd−WS) evolution. From Figure 3a, we observe that this energy component accounts for most of the variation in the total energetic change, as it decreases by EvPd−WS ≈ 1000 kcal/ mol. Thus, it follows that this attractive interaction is the main

driving force of this process. Second, we consider the variation of

the ESOL(el), which for protein adsorption on neutral surfaces, it represents the solvent electrostatic screening within the protein.

Note that this component is the sole diﬀerence between OBC

(Figure S8) and HCT (Figure 3) methods, and thus, it fully

accounts for the slightly diﬀerent adsorptions obtained with

them. From these ﬁgures, we see that ΔESOL(el) is contributing signiﬁcantly to the total energy change, namely, by 30%. In

particular, for 300/400 kcal

HCT/OBC, mol−1 during

we observe that the adsorption,

ESOL(el) increases by which highlights the

highly repulsive nature of this interaction. Additionally, this

variation shows that when approaching the surface, the protein is

losing a signiﬁcant amount of its electrostatic screening, which

shall certainly aﬀect its internal stability.

3.3. vdW Interaction: The Cost of Breaking the

Solvation Shell and Its Importance. In Figure 4a, we show

the variation of the vdW protein−substrate interaction during the adsorption time (ΔtEvPd−WS) for all the solvents considered here. Note that, henceforth, the results presented always refer to

the MD simulations characterized in Sec 3.1. From Figure 4a, we observe that in all cases ΔtEvPd−WS < 0, that is, the vdW protein− substrate interaction favors the adsorption process regardless of

the solvent method used. In contrast with this similarity, two

major diﬀerences may also be noticed when comparing explicit

and implicit solvent results. First, at the end of the adsorption process, we observe that |ΔtEvPd−WS| is ∼5 times larger in implicit solvent simulations as compared to the explicit solvent

simulations. It is worth mentioning that, among implicit solvent

methods, the largest energy is obtained with the OBC method,

which is also the one where a larger protein unfolding is

observed. The second major diﬀerence between implicit and explicit solvent results concerns the variation rate of EvPd−WS in the initial 10 ns stage prior to the enhanced adsorption protocol. In

explicit solvent simulations, we observe a smooth decrease of EvPd−WS as the protein approaches the surface. This is at odds with OBC/HCT results, where we observe an initial abrupt change of

this interaction. In fact, in explicit solvent simulations at the end of the whole adsorption process (Δt = 150 ns), the total ΔtEvPd−WS is much smaller than the corresponding change during the initial

10 ns of implicit solvent simulations. In order to understand the origin of the diﬀerent ΔtEvPd−WS
obtained at the end of each simulation, we now analyze how this

interaction is correlated with the CSA. From Figure 4b, we observe that ΔtEvPd−WS depends linearly on CSA, with a similar slope for all the solvent methods considered here. Moreover, when computing the slope, we obtain ΔtEvPd−WS/ΔCSA ≈ 32 kcal

vdW interaction energies per unit area obtained in gold-standard quantum chemistry simulations (10−100 kcal mol−1 nm−2).72
Besides the obvious conclusion that regardless of the solvent method used, the interaction EvPd−WS is computed similarly, this result highlights that implicit solvent methods have a larger ΔtEvPd−WS only because at the end of the adsorption process, the CSA is also larger. Thus, larger ΔtEvPd−WS is solely a consequence, and not the origin, of why diﬀerent solvation methods result in very diﬀerent ﬁnal adsorption conﬁgurations. Additionally, this indicates that to trace the origin of these diﬀerences, we must
understand why CSA increases more easily in implicit solvent
methods as compared to explicit ones.
The slower rate of CSA obtained in explicit solvent
simulations can be understood in light of the time evolution of all intermolecular vdW interactions (ΔtEvdW) shown in Figure 4c. There we observe that in the initial free adsorption regime (t < 10 ns), the attractive protein−substrate interaction energy

(EvPd−WS) is compensated by the sum of two repulsive solvent interactions energies (EvWd−W(P + S) = EvWd−WS + EvWd−WP). This can be thought as the energy gained in adsorbing the protein is
expended in breaking the hydration layers, separating it from the surface, and thus, ΔtEvPd−WS + ΔtEvWd−W(P+S) ≈ 0. As a result, it follows that the vdW component of the eﬀective adsorption force is zero (i.e., FvefdfW = 0). This result leads to an apparent contradiction, as on one hand, the adsorption is spontaneous (as shown by the
CSA in Figure 4c), and on the other hand, the enthalpic vdW
energy balance is null. To solve this paradox, we must now
consider the entropic contribution to the adsorption energy. Although we do not explicitly quantify this contribution, it is
considered in our MD simulations, as these simulations sample
the whole phase space of the system. The thermal vibrations of the water molecules allow for a protein to diﬀuse while in
solution. Additionally, given the isotropic nature of the medium in this diﬀusion, statistically no direction is privileged with
respect to other. If we now consider a case where an adsorbing

substrate breaks this isotropy, we may argue that this diﬀusion

will privilege displacements toward the surface even if the

enthalpic energy gain is null. The mechanism by which this

occurs can be though as follows. Let us consider a protein

surrounded by water molecules in the vicinity of a substrate as

shown in Figure 4d. The force felt by the protein is a sum of an attractive interaction with the surface (i.e., FvPd−WS) with a force opposing the squeezing out of solvent (i.e., FvWd−W(P+S)) necessary for the adsorption to occur. Although our MD simulations

indicate that these two compensate each other, the solvent

thermal ﬂuctuations lead to temporary force unbalances. As

schematically shown in Figure 4d, these unbalances can lead to a

squeeze-out of the solvent and subsequent approximation of the

protein toward the substrate. Additionally, it implies that the

adsorption process using explicit solvent happens as a

consequence of a subtle eﬀect (i.e., the slight separation of

water molecules from the protein surface as a result of thermal

oscillations). Therefore, a slow approach of the protein to the

surface is expected when using explicit solvent, from which

follows a slow evolution of the CSA.

In order to understand why in implicit solvent MD the CSA

evolution is much faster than in explicit solvent MD, we focus on

the vdW solute−solvent interactions of the former. As

mentioned in Sec 3.2, these interactions are included in implicit

solvent simulations via the non-electrostatic solvation compo-

nent (i.e., negligible

the total energy is odds with the fact

that vdW interactions are nonspeciﬁc. From this property, it

follows that the vdW interaction force with its surroundings

should be about the same either if it is in contact with the surface

or with the solvent, assuming that the total area enclosing the

protein is constant during the process. Although this does seem

to be the case in explicit solvent simulations, this is not so for implicit solvent, because ΔESOL(nonel) + ΔEvPd−WS ≈ ΔEvPd−WS ≠ 0 as shown in Sec. 3.2. Therefore, ESOL(nonel) is unable to describe the important vdW solvent contribution to the total energy during

the adsorption process, which could be associated with

processes such as the cost of breaking the solvation shells

surrounding the protein and the substrate. Moreover, this also

results in an overestimation of the eﬀective adsorption force in

iFmvPd−pWSl.icTithsisolovveenrtesstimimualtaitoionnhsaasstwFovWd−Wd(iPre+cSt)

≈ 0, and thus, FvefdfW ≈ consequences: a quasi-

instantaneous adsorption process and a much higher adsorption

force as compared with that of explicit solvent simulations. This

two consequences allow us to explain the two diﬀerences

observed between implicit and explicit solvent results in the CSA

evolution (i.e., faster evolution and the larger ﬁnal absolute

values). Moreover, although both aforementioned consequen-

ces certainly aﬀect the protein stability, the rapid change of the

CSA alone does not suﬃce to explain the unfolding observed in

implicit solvent simulations. As explained in the following

section, this quasi-instantaneous adsorption is accompanied by

an abrupt change in the protein’s electrostatic energy, which is

ultimately the mechanism that promotes its unfolding.

3.4. Electrostatic Interaction: Implicit Solvent Simu-

lation Does Not Correctly Shield the Internal Energy of

the Protein Adsorbed. The previous section highlights the

importance of the vdW energy component of the solvation

energy in compensating the large protein−surface interaction. In

what follows, we focus on the time evolution of the electrostatic component of the solvation energy (i.e., ΔtEeSlOL) for both explicit
and implicit solvent methods (Figure 5a). This energy

contribution is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the electro-

static energy of the protein−substrate system immersed in water with respect to its electrostatic energy in vacuum.52 In implicit solvent simulations, this energy component is deﬁned as the
generalized Born solvation energy.

For our system, as the graphene atoms are not charged, this term accounts for the solvent screening of the protein intramolecular electrostatic interactions. In explicit solvent simulations, the deﬁnition52 of EeSlOL results in the following expression

the electrostatic internal energy of the for the electrostatic water−protein
accounts for the electrostatic water-

surface interaction. Note that as the graphene atoms are not

charged, EeWl −S = 0.

From Figure 5a, we observe that, in explicit solvent

simulations, the electrostatic contribution of the solvent energy

hardly changes during the adsorption process, as ΔtEeSlOL ≈ 0. To

analyze in detail this result, in Figure 5b, we have decomposed

EeSlOL into its diﬀerent non-null components (i.e., From this Figure, we may derive two diﬀerent

the protein adsorbs, the loss of water−protein electrostatic

energy arising from protein’s dehydration is fully compensated

by the gain of water’s internal electrostatic energy. This internal

energy gain is in turn a result of new water−water hydrogen

bonds being formed during protein’s dehydration. The balance between these two mechanisms explains why EeSlOL does not seem
to contribute enthalpically to the adsorption process. Moreover,

this balance seems to be independent of the hydrophobic

character of the protein, as a similar result is obtained for the

more hydrophilic BSA protein (Figure S10). Additionally, it is important to remark that ΔtEeWl is much smaller for the BSA adsorption as compared to the IgG’s adsorption. This result is in

agreement with one’s expectations based on the proteins’

diﬀerent degrees of hydrophobicity. In particular, one would

expect that the BSA (more hydrophilic) disrupts less the

hydrogen-bonded water network than the IgG (less hydrophilic,

see Figure S10). Therefore, during the adsorption dehydration

process, this should translate into a smaller water internal energy gain (i.e., ΔEeWl ) in the BSA as compared with the IgG.
In Sec 3.3, we showed that in implicit solvent simulations, the protein adsorbs instantly due to a high protein−surface vdW interaction. This fast adsorption results in a rapid increase of the CSA during the ﬁrst 2.5 ns for both implicit solvent methods (Figure 6a). Additionally, in Figure 6b, we also observe that

Time evolution during the whole adsorption process of (a) the CSA, (b) the electrostatic component of the solvation energy, ESOL(el), and (c) the internal electrostatic energy of the protein, EePl, using the HCT40 (blue) and the OBC41 (red) implicit solvent methods.
during this time range, ΔtEeSlOL > 700 kcal/mol, which shows that the electrostatic contribution of the solvent energy is working against the protein adsorption, thus acting as an eﬀective repulsive force. However, this repulsive force is unable to hinder the protein adsorption, as the attractive vdW protein−surface interaction compensates this energy loss (Figure 3a). Still, as a result of the adsorption, the system is left with a large electrostatic energy unbalance, which may only be alleviated by a major structural rearrangement of the charges present on the system, which in implicit solvent is only on the protein atoms. Remarkably, in Figure 6c, we observe that the protein’s internal electrostatic energy, EePl, not only decreases signiﬁcantly as a result of the adsorption process but also the variation of this energy component is strongly correlated with ΔtEeSlOL. This correlation demonstrates that the aforementioned electrostatic unbalance leads to a major protein-structural rearrangement. Moreover, it is important to note that all these energy changes (namely, ΔtEePl, ΔtEeSlOL, and ΔEvPd−WS) occur almost instantaneously (i.e., within the ﬁrst two nanoseconds). The large energy unbalances coupled with their fast time rates result in a swift protein unfolding upon adsorption when using implicit solvent methods, as clearly evidenced by its secondary structure evolution shown in Figure 2d. Therefore, protein adsorption

using implicit-solvation methods can be seen as a three step
process. First, the protein quickly approaches the surface as a
consequence of the vdW interaction. Second, as a consequence of the protein−surface approach, a large electrostatic repulsive
force emerges from the solvent contribution. Lastly, to reduce
that this energy unbalance, the protein is instantaneously forced to rearrange its atoms, which in turn leads to the protein’s
unfolding. As a result, one may argue that this spurious unfolding observed in many diﬀerent implicit solvent MD works
concerning the protein adsorption to uncharged surfaces may
be understood in terms of the ill-characterization of these three
elements. One of the two major diﬀerences observed between implicit
and explicit solvent MD simulations concerns the evolution of
the electrostatic energy component of the solvation energy. In particular, Figure 5a shows that ΔtEeSlOL,implicit > 0, whereas ΔtEeSlOL,explicit ≈ 0. This major qualitative and quantitative diﬀerence may be traced back to the deﬁnition of this term in
the two solvent methods (eqs 9 and 10). In the explicit solvent simulation, ΔtEeSlOL,explicit considers two diﬀerent solvent eﬀects: the changes in protein’s intramolecular solvent screening via the ΔtEeWl −P term and the changes in the solvent−solvent electrostatic interaction via the ΔtEeWl term. Notably, in Figure 5b, we observed that these two terms are highly correlated. This
correlation highlights the feedback mechanism, in which electrostatic energy losses arising from protein’s dehydration
are compensated by similar energy gains in the solvent (through, e.g., additional solvent−solvent hydrogen bonds). This balance
loss/gain of electrostatic interactions of the water molecules
with protein/water is what ultimately regulates the electrostatic contribution of the solvation energy, leading to ΔtEeSlOL,explicit ≈ 0 during adsorption. However, in implicit solvent simulations, ΔtEeSlOL,implicit only accounts for the ﬁrst of this two eﬀects (i.e., the loss of the solvent screening of the intramolecular protein
electrostatic interactions). For this reason, using this solvent
method, the electrostatic contribution to the solvent energy supposes a positive energy gradient (ΔtEeSlOL, implicit > 0), which only can be balanced with the reorganization of the protein’s atoms. This diﬀerence remarks the importance of considering the gain of the water−water electrostatic interaction during
adsorption, as only when it is omitted (implicit solvent), the evolution of EeSlOL aﬀects the structural stability of the protein.
The other diﬀerence between implicit and explicit solvent simulations concerns the loss of the water−protein electrostatic
interaction while the protein adsorbs/dehydrates. To understand this diﬀerence, we ﬁrst need to comprehend how EeSlOL,implicit describes this process. To this aim, we have analyzed the variation of EeSlOL,implicit when a charged model molecule approaches a neutral model surface. Both systems (i.e., the
molecule and the surface), are conformed by spheres/atoms of
radius 1 RvdW, as shown in the inset of Figure 7a. The spheres of the molecule are equally positively charged, whereas the ones of the surface are neutral. We have used the same deﬁnition of EeSlOL,implicit = ESOL(el) = EGB as in the HCT method40 (eq 2). According to that deﬁnition, each charged sphere/atom i of the
solute contributes to the total electrostatic component of the
solvent energy via the expression

where Ri (i.e., the eﬀective Born radii), reﬂects the degree of burial of the sphere/atom i inside the molecule. We have
computed numerically that expression to analyze how ESOL(el) changes with the molecule−surface distance, dM−S.
In Figure 7a, we observe that, as the molecule approaches to
the surface, ESOL(el) largely increases. This result is very similar to the one shown in Figure 3a (i.e., when the molecule and the
surface are the IgG protein and the graphene double layer,
respectively). This similarity highlights that the observed increase of ESOL(el) during adsorption is not a speciﬁc consequence of the adsorption process of the IgG but a general
feature of the implicit solvent methods. To understand this feature, we analyze the contribution of each molecule’s sphere to ΔESOL(el) for diﬀerent dM−S values. In Figure 7b, we observe an enhancement of the contribution of the spheres closer to the
surface when dM−S decreases. This enhancement, in accordance with eq 11, arises from an increase of the Born radii of these “close to surface” spheres as shown in Figure S11. Therefore, the
increase of ESOL(el) when a charged molecule approaches a neutral surface accounts for the following process. When the
molecule is far from the surface, the degree of burial of one
molecule sphere only depends on its position inside the

molecule. For this reason, these “close to surface” spheres/ atoms are outer spheres in that situation (small Born radii). However, when the molecule approaches to the surface, the position of the surface spheres starts to aﬀect the degree of burial of the molecule spheres. As a consequence, these “close to surface” spheres/atoms start to act as inner spheres (i.e., their Born radii enlarge). This ultimately leads to the increase of ESOL(el), explaining how the loss of water−protein electrostatic interactions is described in implicit solvent simulations.
In an explicit solvent simulation, the loss of water−protein electrostatic interactions is described via the removal of the water molecules that are in the region between the molecule and the surface. This removal process is more gradual than the process of change of the Born radii used in implicit solvent simulations. Additionally, as implicit solvent methods overestimate the eﬀective vdW protein−surface attractive force, the adsorption process is faster in these simulations than in those using explicit solvent (Sec 3.3). These two factors cause, as shown in Figure 5, a larger and faster loss of water−protein electrostatic interaction in implicit solvent simulation (ΔtEeSlOL,implicit) than in explicit solvent simulations (ΔtEeWl −P). Considering the direct correlation between this loss and the reorganization of the protein’s atoms, this diﬀerence is translated into instantaneous and great changes in the structure of the protein. Therefore, the abrupt loss of water−protein electrostatic interactions contributes also to the unfolding of the protein.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, the IgG adsorption process on a graphene surface was studied using both explicit and implicit solvent simulations. The results of the explicit solvent simulation show that water molecules play an active role in the adsorption process. When the protein approaches the graphene surface, the loss of water− protein electrostatic interaction becomes balanced by the gain of the water−water electrostatic interaction. This regulates the electrostatic contribution of the solvation energy. Additionally, the cost of breaking protein and surface solvation shells compensates the vdW attraction that exists between them. Despite this energy compensation, the protein adsorbs on the surface. This indicates that the driving force of the adsorption process does not only present an enthalpic origin. The thermal vibrations of the water molecules allow the protein to diﬀuse, and the presence of an attractive protein−surface force guides this protein diﬀusion toward the surface. Therefore, entropic eﬀects seem to be important in the adsorption process of a protein on a neutral surface.
In contrast, implicit solvent methods underestimate the cost of breaking the solvation shells of the protein and the substrate. This leads to an overestimation of the eﬀective vdW protein− surface attractive force, causing an instantaneous adsorption process. In addition to the fast adsorption process, a large energy gradient arises from the loss of the water−protein electrostatic interaction. Contrary to explicit solvent simulation, that energy gradient is not balanced by the gain of water−water electrostatic interaction, which is not included in implicit solvent simulations. Therefore, the only way of alleviating that energy unbalance is by reorganizing the position of the only charges of the system, the protein atoms. This reorganization happens abruptly, which leads to the unfolding of the protein. Thus, in this work, we have been able to understand the factors that lead to unfolded protein conﬁguration upon adsorption when implicit solvent methods are used. To evade the unfolding of the protein, we propose to

improve both non-electrostatic an electrostatic components of the solvation energy. Concerning the ﬁrst, we think that it underestimates the vdW repulsive solute−solvent interaction, which according to explicit solvent simulations has an important role in the adsorption process. Regarding the electrostatic component, we propose a correction in the Born radii deﬁnition in order to obtain a more gradual loss of the solvent screening of the intraprotein electrostatic interactions.
