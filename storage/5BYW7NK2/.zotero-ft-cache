Abstract: We describe here a general Amber force ﬁeld (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force ﬁelds for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force ﬁeld (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force ﬁeld. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching.

Introduction
Molecular mechanics force ﬁelds are a key component underlying many investigations of the protein–ligand structure for rational drug design and other tasks.1–4 The use of empirical parameters enables them (in favorable cases) to model conformational changes and noncovalent interaction energies quite accurately. A successful force ﬁeld in drug design should work well both for biological molecules and the organic molecules that interact with them. For example, the “Amber” force ﬁelds5–8 were primarily developed for protein and nucleic acid systems. The fact that Amber only has limited parameters for organic molecules has prevented it from being widely used in drug design and other studies of ligand–protein or ligand–DNA interactions. Here, we describe a general Amber force ﬁeld that works for most of the pharmaceutical molecules, and which is designed to be as compatible as possible to the traditional Amber protein force ﬁelds.

The desirability of a general purpose force ﬁeld to describe a wide variety of organic molecules has been recognized before. Several widely used general force ﬁelds include MMFF94,9 MM3,10 MM4,11 Tripos 5.2,12 and the AMBER* parameters in the Macromodel program.13,14 In addition, the OPLS force ﬁelds15 are based on functional groups, so that extensions to many organic molecules are straightforward. For various reasons, those force ﬁelds have not been as widely used in studying biological systems as more speciﬁcally parameterized force ﬁelds such as AMBER, CHARMM, and OPLS; the latter, in turn, have no automatic way of assigning parameters for arbitrary organic molecules. There is arguably a signiﬁcant advantage in developing an organics force ﬁeld that is consistent in its form and parameterization with those

used for proteins and nucleic acids. Here we look at extending the AMBER force ﬁeld to cover more organic species. This is possible because an extensible strategy was used for development of the biomolecular parameters, and some extension to organics has already been described.8 Here, we describe such an extension to a much wider class of molecules.
A simple functional form, such as the so-called “Class I” model of eq. (1), is often adequate to describe the structures and nonbonded energies for organic and bioorganic systems:

Here, req and ␪eq are equilibration structural parameters; Kr, K␪, Vn are force constants; n is multiplicity and ␥ is the phase angle for the torsional angle parameters. The A, B, and q parameters characterize the nonbonded potentials.
Parameterization plays a crucial role in molecular mechanics. A good parameter set should reproduce the experimental data not only for the molecules in a training set, but also for molecules outside of the training set. Moreover, the parameter set should be complete and self-consistent. In GAFF, the basic parameterization philosophy, which follows ideas outlined earlier for the “Parm99” parameters,8 is as follows. For the nonbonded part, van der Waals parameters are inherited from traditional Amber force ﬁelds directly; partial charges are assigned using a restrained electrostatic potential ﬁt (RESP) model,16,17 because of its clear physical picture and straightforward implementation scheme. For the internal terms [the ﬁrst three terms in eq. (1)], parameterizations were ﬁrst performed on bond lengths and bond angles that are weakly coupled to other parts in the energy function. Typically, equilibrium bond lengths and bond angles come from experiment and high-level ab initio calculations; the force constants are estimated through an empirical approach (presented below) and optimized to reproduce experimental and high-level ab initio vibrational frequencies.
Unlike the “hard parameters” of bond length and bond angle, torsional angle parameters are soft, and are highly coupled to the nonbonded energy terms. Torsional angle parameters are parameterized last, to cover other effects that cannot be considered in a simple functional form (such as polarization, charge transfer, and many body effects), in addition to intrinsic bond torsion preferences. In practice, torsional angle parameters are derived to reproduce the energy differences of two conformations and rotational proﬁles, based on experimental or high-level ab initio data. Parmscan, a force ﬁeld parameterization program developed in our group,18 was extensively used to derive the bond length, bond angle, and torsional angle parameters in this work. Some of our model molecules (such as No. 90 in Fig. 4), look strange because they are not stable species; however, such examples are necessary to make our force ﬁeld complete (for the basic atom types) and make our empirical rules for deriving missing parameters work smoothly. In the following parts of this article, details are given on

force ﬁeld parameterization and on the performance of GAFF in the three test cases.
It is worth noting that the procedure described here requires as input a complete three-dimensional structure (including hydrogen atoms) that is close enough to an energy minimum to be optimized by standard semiempirical quantum mechanical methods. Generating such structures for libraries of potential ligands is itself a nontrivial task, and is beyond the scope of this article.
Generation of Parameters
Atom Type Deﬁnition
In molecular mechanics force ﬁelds, “similar” chemical environments are encoded as atom types, and these deﬁnitions are crucial to success and transferability. By using more atom types, one can describe subtle chemical environments more accurately, but this also leads to a bigger parameterization burden. Therefore, atom types should be used as economical as possible, and new atom types introduced only to signiﬁcantly improve the force ﬁeld performance.
For GAFF, we have introduced 35 basic atom types: ﬁve carbon, eight nitrogen, three oxygen, ﬁve sulfur, four phosphorus, six hydrogen, and one atom type for each of the four common halogens; these are listed as types 1–35 in Table 1. For these basic atom types, GAFF is a complete force ﬁeld, which means all the parameters are available or can be estimated according to our empirical rules. Atom types were chosen according to the following atom properties, from more general to more speciﬁc: element type, hybridization, aromaticity, and chemical environment. For example, ﬂuorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine have only one atom type (element type), whereas carbon has ﬁve atom types: c3 (sp3 hybridization), c1 (sp1 hybridization), c (sp2 hybridization, chemical environment, i.e., bonded to S or O), ca (sp2 hybridization, aromatic property), and c2 (sp2 hybridization).
We have then included another 22 special atom types (Nos. 36 –57), as described in Table 1. Speciﬁc atom types were deﬁned mainly based on the chemical environment. The special atom types are classiﬁed into four groups, and were introduced for different purposes.
Group I (Nos. 53–57) consists ﬁve hydrogen types (h1– h5) that are attached to carbons in different chemical environments, and have different van der Waals parameters. This need for multiple van der Waals parameters for hydrogens, depending on what they are bonded to, is inherited from AMBER force ﬁelds, and its justiﬁcation has been discussed earlier.8
Group II (Nos. 39 – 42) contains cx and cy (sp3 carbons in three- and four-membered rings), and cu and cv (sp2 carbons in three- and four-membered rings). When the Group II atom types occur in a bond angle, the equilibrium parameter is usually much different from that of the corresponding angle parameter for the general carbon types. For example, cx– cx– cx has an equilibrium bond angle of 60° compared to 109.5° for c3– c3– c3. Although the minimized structures with and without special atom types are quite similar (the dominant driving force are bond length parameters, which are similar for the special and general atom types), the calculated vibrational frequencies are quite different.

In Group III (Nos. 36, 37, 44, 45, 47, 48), cc (cd), nc (nd), and pc (pd) are inner sp2 atoms in conjugated ring systems; ce (cf), ne (nf), and pe (pf) are inner sp2 atom in conjugated chain systems; and cg (ch) are inner sp carbons in conjugated systems. Because both cc and cd are inner sp2 carbons in conjugated ring systems, they are assigned according to a simple rule: both cc— cc and cd— cd are conjugated single bonds, and cc— cd is conjugated double bond. Other pairs of atom types in Group III behave in a similar fashion: bonds between the same type are single bonds, whereas bonds between different types are double bonds. Group III atoms are designed to describe alternating conjugated systems, without adding an explicit concept of bond order. The bond parameters and torsional potentials of the two bond types are different. For example, c2— ce or c2— cf or ce— cf double bonds have

a v2 of 11.2 kcal/mol, whereas the ce— ce or cf— cf single bonds have a v2 of 5.6 kcal/mol. Figure 1 shows some examples of molecules having atom types in this group.
In Group IV (Nos. 38, 43, 46, 49 –52), cp (cq) is the bridge atoms of two aromatic rings. A rule similar to that for conjugated systems is also applied for cp(cq): both cp— cp and cq— cq are single bond and other types (cp— cq, ca— cp, ca— cq) are aromatic bonds. Atom types nb and pb are aromatic nitrogen and phosphate; sx and sy are sulfur in conjugated sulfoxide and sulfone systems; px and py are phosphorus in conjugated phosphite and phosphate systems. Figure 1 shows some examples of molecules having atom types in Group IV. The atom types in Group IV have similar function as atom types in Group III. For example, without py, it would be very difﬁcult

to discriminate single vs. double p—p bonds in compounds 24 and 25 in Figure 1.
Bond type information (such as bond orders) can be very helpful in classifying and discriminating among similar chemical environments. For various reasons, many force ﬁelds, including AMBER, only apply atom type information, and do not separately name or keep track of bond orders or types. To be consistent with the existing AMBER force ﬁelds and codes, we have used the sets of identical atom type pairs described above (cc/cd, cp/cq, ce/cf, etc.) instead of explicit bond orders to discriminate conjugated/ aromatic single and double bonds. It is notable that although our scheme works for most of the molecules, there are still some special molecules that cannot be properly handled. We think that most of the failures happen to conjugated/aromatic rings attached to large aliphatic rings [10 ϩ 4n (n ϭ 0, 1, 2) membered rings]. Figure 1(c) lists two examples of the kind of molecules for which our current scheme would fail. In our experience, such failures are only rarely encountered, but future extensions of the GAFF force ﬁeld will have to consider these sorts of molecules.
We have developed an atom-type perception program, which is part of the antechamber suite of Amber, to assign the atom types described here, based only on an input geometry. Details of the algorithms involved will be presented in a separate article.19

Charges
To accurately ﬁt conformational and nonbonded energies in a transferable fashion, one should choose consistent charge approach. The restrained electrostatic potential (RESP)16,20 at HF/631G* is the default charge approach applied in the Amber protein force ﬁelds. Although RESP is expensive compared to empirical schemes such as Gasteiger charges, it has many desirable features, and allows one to use fewer torsional terms than might otherwise be required.8 It has worked well in tests of small molecules21,22 as well as proteins. This is the default charge scheme in GAFF parameterization. Unfortunately, the fact that this charge scheme needs to run ab initio optimization at the HF/6-31G* level has prevented it from being widely used in handling large numbers of molecules. In this situation, one may apply an alternative charge scheme called AM1-BCC (bond charge correction),23,24 which is much cheaper than HF/6-31G* RESP. The basic idea of AM1BCC is to ﬁrst carry out a semiempirical AM1 calculation to get Mulliken charges, followed by a bond charge correction scheme to obtain results that are compatible with RESP charges. We use the BCC parameters derived by Jakalian et al.,24 which are designed to make AM1-BCC charges match the electrostatic potential at the HF/6-31G* level.

For each bond type broadly deﬁned by elements, n is the number of data, m is the negative of slope and c is the intercept.

Lennard–Jones Parameters
The van der Waals parameters of GAFF are as same as those used by the Amber parm94 or parm99 force ﬁelds. There is only one set of parameters (the internuclear separation of the ij pair at the potential minimum, r*ij, and the potential well, ␧ij) for each element except hydrogen. Therefore, we believe the van der Waals parameters can be reliably transferred to new introduced atom types in GAFF.

Bond Parameters
GAFF uses three sources of information about equilibrium bond lengths req: the Amber protein force ﬁelds, ab initio calculations (MP2/6-31G*), and crystal structures. Most of the experimental data comes from mean values of req obtained from X-ray and neutron diffraction.25,26 Data were carefully classiﬁed based on the atom types, and the most precise mean values from these three compilations were chosen as the req in GAFF.

Ab initio frequencies were computed at the MP2/6-311Gϩ(d,p) level and then scaled down by 0.9496 as suggested by Scott and Radom (Scott, A. P.; Radom, L. J Phys Chem 1996, 100, 16502). Experimental frequencies are taken from ref. 9.

As does MMFF 94,9 GAFF applies an empirical rule to estimate the missing parameters of bond length force constants. MMFF 94 applied an inverse sixth-power dependence in Badger’s formula to relate the desired force constants to tabulated reference values:

through linear least-squares ﬁtting. We performed such ﬁttings for C—C (25 data), C—N (24 data), and C—O (7 data) bonds using the Amber bond length parameters as training set. Taking C—O as an example, 7 out of 11 C—O unique bond length parameters are represented by the following bond length types: C—O, C—O2, C—OH, C2—OH, C2—OS, C3—OH, CT—OS.
Figure 2 shows the results, with regression coefﬁcients m of 5.0 for C—C, and 4.0 for C—N and C—O. Based on these results, a mean value of m of 4.5 was chosen. The three ln(Kij) constants were then reﬁt using the ﬁnal value of m.
To derive the Kij parameters for X—X, (X ϭ H, F, Cl, Br, I, N, O, and P), we have designed some model molecules and performed high-level ab initio vibrational frequencies analysis, as described in the Methods section. The force constants were then optimized using Parmscan to reproduce the vibration frequencies. For sulfur, Kij of S—S was estimated using bond length parameters of disulﬁdes in the Amber protein force ﬁelds. [If one knows rij and Kr, then Kij can be computed according to eq. (3).] Table 2 lists the ab initio as well as GAFF vibrational frequencies for the eight model molecules and CH3SSCH3. For the 21 frequencies, the unsigned average error (UAE) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between ab initio and GAFF are 37 and 48 cmϪ1, respectively. If the comparisons were made to scaled ab initio frequencies, the UAE and RMSE are 48 and 70 cmϪ1.

Finally, force constants were calculated for 103 bond lengths in AMBER force ﬁeld using the above model. The average percent error is 1.6%, which shows a good consistency with the Amber bond stretching parameters that were empirically ﬁt to vibrational spectra of peptide fragments. Table 3 lists the ﬁnal 47 Kij parameters. This strategy of using the force constants in the AMBER protein force ﬁeld as a references has the obvious limitation that the results are dependent upon the quality of the previous parameterization; on the other hand, it helps to ensure that GAFF is consistent with the AMBER parameters. Further studies are planned, aimed at improving both small molecule and protein values.

Figure 3. Principle of torsional angle parameterization using Parmscan: red and blue curves are rotational proﬁles produced by MP4/6311G(d,p) and GAFF, respectively. The model compound is Molecule 1 shown in Figure 4(a) and the torsional angle in question is X– c– c–X. For this molecule, the ab initio torsional angle scanning was carried out from 0 to 330° with a step of 30°. With a V2 term of 1.2 (phase angle is 180° and multiplicity is 4) kcal/mol, the two curves are well matched, and the RMSD of relative energies is 0.24 kcal/mol.

Angle Parameters

GAFF uses the same three sources of information (previous force ﬁelds, MP2/6-31G* calculations, and crystal data) for equilibrium bond angles as for bond lengths. Experimental data mainly comes from ref. 25. Data from all three resources were carefully classiﬁed based on the atom types, and the most precise mean values were chosen for ␪eq.
It is a very heavy burden to work out all the bond angle parameters. If all the combinations are considered, there are roughly 20,000 bond angle parameters only for the basic atom types, and most of them are not available. We have found an empirical approach that works well in most situations. For bond angle ␪A–B–C, the equilibrium bond angle is taken as the mean value of ␪A–B–A and ␪C–B–C. Therefore, if we have parameterized all bond angles of the form ␪A–B–A, ␪eq of any bond angle can be estimated from this simple rule. In total we have carried out minimizations on 1800 model molecules at the MP2/6-31G* level, with an aim to get the equilibrium angle of ␪A–B–A in all kinds of combinations.
As with bond lengths, GAFF applies empirical formulas to estimate bond angle force constants. A similar formula was also used by MMFF 94 to estimate the missing bond angle force constants.

With this model, we have calculated bond angle force constants

for 252 bond angles in the Amber protein force ﬁeld. The average

percent error is 9.0%. One should realize that bond angle force

constants in Amber force ﬁelds are really simple. Typically for

bond angle ␪A–B–C, if A and C are both hydrogen atoms, the force constant is roughly 30 –35 kcal/mol ⅐ radϪ2; if A or C is hydrogen, the force constant is roughly 50 kcal/mol ⅐ radϪ2; in other cases, the force constant is roughly 70 kcal/mol ⅐ radϪ2. As with the

comparable parameterization of bond length force constants above,

our procedure mainly helps to ensure a consistent pattern of bond

angle distortion energies, compared to the AMBER protein force

ﬁeld.

Torsional Angle Parameters
In GAFF, torsional angle parameterizations were performed using the following strategy. First, torsional angle scanning was carried

Figure 4. Model molecules for used to derive angle parameters using Parmscan. The torsional angles in question are colored in red. (a) Molecule 1–30; (b) Molecule 31– 60; (c) Molecule 61–90; (d) Molecule 91–120; (e) Molecule 121–145; (f) Molecule 146 –175; (g) Molecule 176 –200.

out at the MP4/6-311G(d,p)//MP2/6-31G* level; then Parmscan was applied to derive torsional angle potential Vi to reproduce the ab initio rotational proﬁle. The basic idea was shown in Figure 3. The red curve is the MP4/6-311G(d,p) rotational proﬁle and the blue one is the molecular mechanical proﬁle. A V2 term with force constant of 1.2 (phase angle is 180° and multiplicity of 4) makes the MM curve match the ab initio one perfectly except at range Ϫ15 to 15°.
In total, we have derived 200 torsional angle parameters using this strategy. Figure 4 shows the 200 model molecules and the torsional angle used for scanning was colored in red. Table 5 lists the unsigned average error as well as the RMS error for each torsional angle parameters. Overall, the average UAE and RMS error of 200 torsional angles are 0.54 and 0.72 kcal/mol, respectively.
To make parameters more transferable, it is not a good idea to include more terms just for the purpose of reducing UAE and RMS error. Typically, most of the 200 parameters have only one general term, either V1 or V2 or V3. Special torsional angle parameters were added only when UAE and RMS can be signiﬁcantly reduced.
Test Cases
The performance of GAFF is illustrated here with three test cases. Test I was designed to test how well GAFF predicts the molecular structures, and Tests II and III were used to test how well GAFF predicts the inter- and intramolecular energies.
Test I: Molecular Structures
In this test, we have performed minimizations for 74 molecules that have crystallographic structures. Those molecules were also studied by other widely used force ﬁeld such as MMFF 94, Tripos 6.8, etc. None of the 74 molecules were in the training set to parameterize GAFF. Minimization were performed using the AM1-BCC scheme both in gas phase (dielectric constants ␧ ϭ 1) and a medium with ␧ ϭ 4. The minimized structures were than compared to the crystal ones. Table 6 lists the root-mean-square of displacement of the two structures, the root-mean-square deviations of bond lengths and bond angles.
For gas phase dielectric constant, a RMS displacement of 0.256 Å was achieved. This performance is comparable to that of Tripos 5.2 force ﬁeld12 (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.474 and 0.438 Å, respectively).9 The root-mean-square deviation of bond length and bond angle were 0.023 Å and 2.201°, which are comparable to those of MMFF 94 (0.021 Å and 1.97°, respectively) and better than those of Tripos 5.2 (0.025 Å and 2.5°) and DREIDING (0.035 Å and 3.22°, respectively).9
Most of the large deviations happen in molecules containing S and P. We found the atomic charges of S and P seem too large in GAFF. Some molecules (Compounds 6, 66, and 68) give poor geometries, presumably because of so strong an electrostatic interaction in the gas phase. However, applying a larger dielectric constant can scale down the electrostatic interaction, and we found a dielectric constant of 4 works well for such situations (data not

For each molecule, ab initio torsional angle scanning was performed at the MP4/6-311G(d,p)//MP2/6-31G* level from 0 to 180° with a step of 30° except No. 1, which was from 0 to 330 with a step of 30°. If an optimization failure happened, that conformation was taken out. UAE and RMSE are unsigned-average and root-mean-square errors of the molecular mechanical energies compared to the ab initio for the n Ϫ 1 energy pairs in kcal/mol.

shown). In a condensed phase simulation, the environment might provide such a screening of electrostatic interactions. Nevertheless, future studies aimed at ﬁnding improved charges for some of these systems seem warranted.
Test II: Hydrogen-Bond Energies
In Test II, 22 base pairs were studied using GAFF with two charge schemes (AM1-BCC and RESP charge) and three dielectric constants (␧ ϭ 1, 2, and 4). Then the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to those obtained at the MP2/6-31G* level. Intermolecular energies were always calculated using dielectric constant of 1. The

results are very encouraging: for GAFF/RESP with the gas dielectric constant, the RMS of displacements, and relative energies (energetic differences between the MM and QM values) are 0.255 Å and 1.21 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are only marginally larger than those in Parm99/RESP, which are 0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively. As to GAFF/AM1BCC, the RMS of displacements and relative energies are still acceptable, which are 0.286 Å and 2.06 kcal/mol.
When minimizations were performed with a dielectric constant of 2, the performances were improved signiﬁcantly for Parm99/RESP, GAFF/RESP, and GAFF/AM1-BCC. The RMS of displacements are 0.169, 0.194, and 0.207 Å, respectively; the RMS of relative energies

Test III: Relative Conformational Energies
Test III was designed to test how well GAFF performs in reproducing the relative energies between two conformation pairs. In total, 71 conformational pairs were studied with the gas phase dielectric constant using GAFF. All of the 71 conformational pairs have experimental data, and they were extensively studied in the Parm99 project.8 Table 10 lists the root-mean-square deviation of the relative energies in a gas-phase dielectric. The results were very encouraging. The RMS relative energies to experiments are 0.47 and 0.52 kcal/mol for GAFF/RESP and GAFF/AM1-BCC, respectively. This performance is only marginally larger than that of Parm99/RESP, which has an RMS relative energy of 0.44 kcal/mol. Moreover, the RMS displacement of minimized structures to the ab initio ones are quite small, typically smaller than 0.1 Å, and very few of them are larger than 0.2 Å.
Methods
Ab Initio Calculations
To parameterize the bond force constants of X—X (X ϭ H, F, Cl, Br, I, N, O, and P), high-level ab initio minimization and frequency analysis were carried out for the following model mole-

cules: H2, F2, Cl2, and Br2 at MP2/6-311ϩG(2d,p); I2 at MP2/ CEP-121G; CH3OOCH3, CH3SSCH3, CH3NHNHCH3 and CH3PHPHCH3 at the MP2/6-31Gϩ(d,p) level. For the last four molecules, optimizations and ESP calculations were also performed at the HF/6-31G* level to get the RESP charges. The density of points per unit area in ESP ﬁtting was increased by using overlay option of “iop(6/42) ϭ 6.” We found this option is necessary to get reliable RESP partial charges that are independent of the molecule’s orientation and coordinates.
MP2/6-31G* optimizations were also performed for nearly 2000 model molecules, to get reliable and sufﬁcient equilibrium bond lengths and bond angles. Most of those molecules are simple small-sized molecules that are widely used in force ﬁeld developments, such as molecules listed in Table 1 of ref. 27. To make GAFF parameter set complete, we also designed a certain mount of model molecules. For instance, butane-2,3-dione was used to estimate c— c bond length and pentane-2,3,4-trione to estimate c— c— c bond angle parameter.
To develop 200 missing torsional angle parameters in GAFF, torsional angle scanning calculations were performed using the following scheme: the whole search range is 180° with a step size of 30°; for each point, minimization was performed at MP2/631G* level then followed by a single calculation at the MP4/6311G(d,p) level. Similarly, HF/6-31G* optimization followed by the high-density ESP calculation with the Merz–Singh–Kollman scheme, was performed for each model molecule to derive the RESP charges.

All the above quantum mechanical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 98 package28 on SGI origin 2000 computers at NCSA.
Molecular Mechanics Methods
RESP partial charges were derived by ﬁtting the ab initio ESP using the Resp program implemented in the Amber7 package.29 Default hyperbolic restraint parameters were applied for the twostage RESP ﬁtting. RESP two-stage input ﬁles were prepared using a program called respgen, which can automatically recognize the equivalent atoms. (The respgen program is part of the antechamber package.)
All minimizations in this work were also carried out using Amber7. Scale factors of 1/1.2 and 1/2 were applied to the 1– 4 electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, respectively. A dielectric constant of 1 was applied except as noted. No cutoff was used for the nonbonded interactions. When the minimized structure deviated far away from the reference one (ab initio or crystallographic structure), a harmonic restraint was applied for torsional angles, with a force constant of 50 –100 kcal/mol-rad2. All such restraints happened in Test III: the gauche conformations of Compound 15 and 16, the skew conformations of Compounds 58, 78, and 79, and the twist boat and chair conformations of Compound 66.

Here, ␻i are the weighting factors, which balance the contributions of different kinds of molecular properties. In this work, molecular properties are vibrational frequencies and relative energy pairs calculated from high-level ab initio calculations.
To get more reliable and transferable torsional angle parameters, we only applied one generic torsional angle parameters for each model molecule, and speciﬁc parameters were added only when it can dramatically reduce the ␹2.
We applied parmscan,18 an automatic force ﬁeld parameter optimization program developed in our group to optimize ␹2. ␻i was set to 1, because we only consider one kind of molecular property for each optimization. Parmscan provides two optimization algorithms, systematic search, and the genetic algorithm (GA). GA works efﬁciently if one wants to optimize several force ﬁeld parameters simultaneously. On the other hand, a systematic search is more efﬁcient in the case of only one or two parameters being

involved in an optimization. In this work, systematic search was extensively used to derive the 200 generic torsional angle parameters Vi.
The following strategies were applied to improve the efﬁciency of systematic search. First of all, if the phase angle is hard to determine, the searching range was purposely set to cross 0.0. If the optimized Vi is negative, the phase angle should converse to 180° from 0° or vice versa. Second, a “focus strategy,” which decreases the step size and searching range gradually, can be efﬁciently, located the optimal Vi from a broad searching space. Empirically, for a bond X—Y, if it is a triple bond, the force constant is usually set to 0.0 kcal/mol; if it is a double bond, a V2 term is adequate; if it is a single bond, either or all of V1, V2, and V3 may be required. In terms of the range of the uniﬁed force constant (constant divided by multiplicity), V3 is usually from Ϫ1 to 1 kcal/mol; V2 and V3 are from Ϫ6 to 6 kcal/mol.
Summary and Conclusions
In this work, we have developed a general AMBER force ﬁeld. We hope it is a useful molecular mechanical force ﬁeld for most of the organic molecules, especially the drug-like molecules. We have based the parameterization on more than 3000 MP2/6-31G* optimizations and 1260 MP4/6-311G(d,p) single-point calculations.
GAFF uses 33 basic atom types and 22 special atom types to cover almost all the chemical space composed of H, C, N, O, S, P,

F, Cl, Br, and I. For the basic atom types, all the bond length, bond angle, and torsional angle parameters are available or can be calculated with empirical rules. Special atom types were introduced to describe certain chemical environments accurately, such as conjugated single and double bonds. Unlike most conventional force ﬁelds, parameters for all combinations of atom types are not contained in an exhaustive table, but are determined algorithmically for each input molecule, based on the bonding topology (which determines the atom types) and the geometry [which is used in eqs. (2) through (6) to determine force constants]. A completely automated, table-driven procedure (called antechamber) is available to assign atom types, charges, and force ﬁeld parameters to almost any organic molecule.19
From the three test cases, encouraging results were achieved, but the real value of this effort will only become clear as it is used in a variety of projects. Even given inevitable speciﬁc weaknesses, the current procedure can be used to get starting values for handoptimization of parameters. Furthermore, as we gain experience with GAFF, improvements can be fed back into antechamber, so that future investigators gain the beneﬁts of improved understanding. Even with its limitations, this general strategy has many advantages over the current situation, where the development of force ﬁelds for new ligands is often fairly subjective, even when a general outline of how to proceed is available. Furthermore, an automated procedure also makes possible systematic surveys of large numbers of ligands, as in database mining and docking.

Two charge schemes, RESP and AM1-BCC, were studied and the RMS deviations to experiments are 0.47 and 0.52 kcal/mol for the two charge approaches, respectively. All the experimental data come from ref. 8. All the energies are in kcal/mol.

In summary, GAFF is an extension of the AMBER force ﬁelds, and it was parameterized for most of the organic molecules. GAFF it is a complete force ﬁeld, and all parameters are available for the basic atom types. We believe that the combination of GAFF with traditional AMBER offers a useful molecular mechanical tool for rational drug design and other areas where protein–ligand or DNA–ligand simulations are employed.
Machine-readable copies of all of the parameters developed here, along with the source code for the antechamber program, are available at http://amber.scripps.edu/antechamber.
