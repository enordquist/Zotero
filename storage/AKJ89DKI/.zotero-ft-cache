Abstract
Hsp70s are molecular chaperones involved in the folding and assembly of proteins. They recognize hydrophobic amino acid stretches in their substrate binding groove. However, a detailed understanding of substrate specificity is still missing. Here, we use the endoplasmic reticulum-resident Hsp70 BiP to identify binding sites in a natural client protein. Two sites are mutually recognized and form stable Hsp70–substrate complexes. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed an extended substrate conformation as a crucial factor for interaction and show an unexpected plasticity of the substrate binding groove. The basic binding mechanism is conserved among different Hsp70s.

Introduction
Molecular chaperones share the remarkable ability to bind and release nonnative proteins.1 One of the major chaperone classes is the ATP-dependent Hsp70 family. Hsp70s consist of an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain connected by a flexible linker to a C-terminal substrate binding domain (SBD).2–4 Exposed stretches of hydrophobic residues were recognized as a signature of Hsp70 substrates.5,6 Based on these studies, a scoring algorithm was developed to classify and identify binding peptides.5,7–10 However, differences in substrate recognition exist between Hsp70s11–13 and our current understanding is not sufficient to predict binding sequences.8
With a view to define key elements of substrate recognition, we determined the binding sites in an endogenous substrate for BiP, the Hsp70 orthologue of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).6,14–16 The interaction of BiP with substrate proteins can be transient17,18 but stable complexes with certain substrates are also observed,19,20 especially for antibody heavy chains

(HCs) that are retained in the ER, if not assembled with a light chain.21–23 In fact, it has been shown that HCs do not even cycle from BiP in vivo20 where a multichaperone complex is involved in antibody biogenesis.24 This quality control mechanism is based on an unfolded CH1 domain in the HC that only folds upon interaction with the light chain.25–27
So far, binding sequences in CH1 were only identified via stimulation of BiP's ATPase activity by CH1-derived peptides.28 However, this approach cannot report on their recognition within the fulllength domain and it does not assess the stability of the BiP–peptide complexes.29
Here, we show that the conformation of substrate peptides plays a pivotal role in the binding process.

nonnative proteins.30,31 The antibody CH1 domain is an important substrate of BiP,21,22 allowing the retention of unpaired HCs in the ER.20,25–27 Authentic
BiP binding sites are generally unknown. In the CH1 domain, they were only analyzed by the ability of CH1specific peptides to stimulate BiP's ATPase activity.28
For a direct anisotropy-based binding assay,
predicted CH1-derived binding peptides were labeled with a fluorophore.32 Only two of the five CH1derived peptides that stimulated BiP's ATPase activity to the largest extent,28 SVFPLAP and

HTFPAVL, bound to BiP with low micromolar affinities (Kd = 12.5 μM and 11.1 μM, respectively; Fig. 1a, Ref. 32 and Table 1). Single point mutations
rendered these into non-binding variants (HTFAAVL
and SVKPLAP; Fig. 1b and Fig. S1). Importantly, if
separately introduced into the full-length domain,
these mutations also decreased the affinity of BiP for CH1 (from Kd = 12.9 μM for CH1 wild type (wt) to Kd = 14.8 μM for CH1 HTFAAVL and to Kd = 25.1 μM for CH1 SVKPLAP; Fig. 1c and Table 1). The respective CH1 double mutant abolished BiP

For the wt, data were fit to a Kd of 12.9 ± 1.1 μM. For the SVKPLAP mutant, a Kd of 25.1 ± 4.2 μM was obtained, and for the HTFAAVL mutant, the Kd was 14.8 ± 1.1 μM. The binding analysis of the CH1 double mutant SVKPLAP–HTFAAVL to BiP did not result in any complex formation.

(f and g) Rate constants for binding of 1 μM labeled SVFPLAP (f) or HTFPAVL peptide (g) to varying concentrations of BiP wt, BiP V430M, and DnaK were

binding completely (Fig. 1c). This indicates that these two sequences are critical for BiP binding to CH1, which might contribute to the high stability of BiP–HC complexes observed in vivo.20
Interestingly, only one BiP molecule can bind to CH1 at a time.32 SVFPLAP and HTFPAVL are found in regions that form β-strands in the folded structure of CH1 and are located in the CH1–CL interface of the fully assembled antibody (Fig. 1d and e).33 The decrease in affinity upon mutation of either site shows that both can be recognized. Their localization in the interface is also in agreement with the competition of BiP and CL for binding.25 This explains the absence of triple BiP–CH1–CL complexes during antibody assembly as the CH1 residues that interact with BiP or CL overlap.25 Importantly, both sequences are highly conserved in IgG (Fig. S2).
Current models of peptide binding to BiP are based on the peptide's hydrophobicity7,28 and cannot explain the non-binding behavior of HTFAAVL as exchanging Pro against Ala does not lead to a substantial change in hydrophobicity. Thus, an additional factor besides hydrophobicity seems to influence BiP binding.
Comparison of substrate binding by BiP and DnaK
To follow up on the unexpected behavior of the HTFAAVL mutation, we investigated peptide binding to BiP and DnaK, an Escherichia coli Hsp70, in detail (Fig. 1 and Table 1).
For the wt peptide HTFPAVL, BiP showed a kon of 0.0013 μM− 1 min− 1 and a koff of 0.0144 min− 1, resulting in a Kd of 11.1 μM (Fig. 1g and Table 1, Ref. 32). The peptide SVFPLAP resulted in a kon of 0.0017 μM− 1 min− 1 and a koff of 0.0213 min− 1 with a calculated Kd of 12.5 μM similar to the equilibrium value (Fig. 1f and Table 1).

However, DnaK associated up to ~ 24-fold faster with the peptides than BiP (kon = 0.0409 μM− 1 min− 1 and 0.0218 μM− 1 min− 1 for SVFPLAP and HTFPAVL, respectively; Figs. 1f and g and 2d; Table 1) and the DnaK–peptide complexes were kinetically less stable as the koff rates were also up to ~ 14-fold higher (Fig. 2d and Table 1). This resulted in calculated Kd values for DnaK in the same range as those for BiP with Kd = 4.8 μM and 9.0 μM for SVFPLAP and HTFPAVL, respectively (Table 1).
We also analyzed binding of the nonnative peptides SVKPLAP and HTFAAVL, which abolished binding to BiP (Fig. 1h and b). DnaK showed significantly reduced affinity for the mutant SVKPLAP peptide and no binding to the HTFAAVL peptide (Fig. S1 and Fig. 3b). Interestingly, DnaK was also able to bind the CH1 wt domain yet not the CH1 double mutant (Fig. S3a and b). Taken together, DnaK bound the same sequences with similar affinities as BiP, yet with different kinetics in agreement with previous studies.11
Structural basis of peptide binding
To investigate the structural aspects of peptide binding to BiP and DnaK, we performed molecular dynamics and docking simulations of the peptides in complex with DnaK [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 1DKX30] and a homology model of BiP's SBD, which is based on the above structure of DnaK, using the program DynaDock34 (see SI Methods and Results). The docking protocol allowed forward and backward binding, but very few energetically favorable backward conformations were obtained and none of them was among the energetically best conformations. Computationally, both the cis and trans Pro connections were investigated.

Bridging residues are shown in magenta and the bound peptide is shown in licorice representation. The hydrophobic bridge is surrounded by a blue circle, the protein–peptide backbone hydrogen bond is surrounded by a green circle, and the hydrophobic protein–peptide sidechain interactions are surrounded by orange circles. (c) Superposed structures of the best-scoring docking poses of SVFPLAP in the BiP wt (protein, silver cartoon; peptide, magenta licorice; bridging residues, blue licorice) and V430M mutant (protein, black cartoon; peptide, lime licorice; bridging residues, cyan licorice) binding sites, respectively. (d) Comparison of BiP wt, BiP V430M, and DnaK with respect to their substrate peptide association and dissociation rates determined by fluorescence anisotropy. The data sets were normalized to BiP wt.

Our simulations revealed two important factors for stable peptide binding: (i) the complementarity of the binding sites' central hydrophobic pocket with the fourth peptide residue (p4) and (ii) the stable bridging conformation of the loops L1–2 and L3–4 in a closed state above the peptide, which is consistent with the literature, at least for DnaK35 (Fig. 2). This bridge was stabilized by a backbone hydrogen bond between the peptide and residue V430 in BiP (M404 in DnaK) and hydrophobic interactions between p3 and p5 and residues within the loops L1–2 and L3–4 (Fig. 2a and b). These features correlated with the structural stability of the complexes (Table S1). The two wt peptides HTFPAVL and SVFPLAP show all of these features in BiP complexes (Fig. 2a and b). For HTFAAVL, the P4A mutation led to a strong destabilization of the complex due to an overall instable binding of A4 in

the central binding pocket. This eventually leads to bridge opening above the peptide (Fig. S4a). In addition, we calculated the binding free-energy change upon mutation to HTFAAVL using the linear interaction energy approximation (see SI) and obtained a ΔΔG of 44.50 kcal mol−1.
Analysis of the peptide complexes with DnaK led to similar results (Table S1). However, the hydrophobic bridge above the bound peptide was less stable. Interestingly, BiP differs from DnaK only in a single amino acid (V430M) in these loops. Simulations showed that this residue was critical for the closing of the bridge, which is more stable in BiP (Fig. 2b and c).
When we experimentally analyzed the binding kinetics of the wt peptides to the respective BiP V430M mutant, we observed an ~15-fold (SVFPLAP) and an ~17-fold (HTFPAVL) acceleration of the kon

Analysis was performed by competition experiments of preformed complexes of 1 μM lucifer yellow-labeled wt peptide HTFPAVL (1) and Hsp70 in the presence of 1 mM ADP and was followed by fluorescence anisotropy. Dissociation was induced by addition of a 150-fold excess of
unlabeled peptide over the labeled peptide. The central Pro residue was exchanged against 5-dimethyl-4-oxaproline (2) or 4-aminobenzoic acid (3).

values (Figs. 1f and g and 2d; Table 1). Similarly, also the koff rates were accelerated ~ 4-fold (SVFPLAP) and ~ 13-fold (HTFPAVL), clearly shifting BiP's affinities towards the DnaK values (Figs. 1f and g and 2d; Table 1). Thus, we could transfer binding characteristics from DnaK to BiP by a single point mutation in the bridge, identifying this region as important for fine-tuning the interaction of different Hsp70s with substrates.
Structural analyses of the peptide binding modes in the publicly available experimental structures of DnaK–peptide complexes support the above binding pattern together with the extended peptide conformation, which can also be found in all experimental structures. This confirms the importance of these concepts for Hsp70–peptide binding in general. 30,36–39
Effects of peptide conformation on Hsp70 interaction
The binding-abolishing P4A mutation in HTFPAVL and our docking results suggest that not only the peptide's hydrophobicity but also the peptide's

specific binding interactions and potentially its conformations are important for stable binding. Hence, we integrated non-proteinogenic amino acids to stabilize specific conformations. As shown in Fig. 3a (1–3), the central Pro of HTFPAVL (1) was exchanged against 5-dimethyl-4-oxaproline (2) to stabilize a kinked conformation and 4-aminobenzoic acid (3) to stabilize an extended conformation. We tested the ability of these peptides to dissociate preformed complexes of BiP with the fluorescently labeled HTFPAVL peptide. For the kinked peptide 2, no decay in the fluorescence anisotropy of the bound wt peptide was observable (Fig. 3a). In contrast, peptide 3 dissociated the complex efficiently (Fig. 3a). These results demonstrate that peptide conformation has a substantial impact on complex formation with elongated conformations being highly favored over kinked ones. In the case of the bacterial DnaK, the kinked peptide 2 dissociated the DnaK– HTFPAVL complex less efficiently than the elongated peptide 3, which exhibited almost wt-like displacement efficiency (Fig. 3b).
To test the binding pocket flexibility, we exchanged p4 against 1,3-diaminobenzoic acid, which allowed

further modification with either a propargyl or Fmoc substituent (Fig. 3, peptides 4, 5, and 6, respectively). Surprisingly, while the small propargyl substituent resulted in decreased binding to BiP, the peptide modified with the large Fmoc group dissociated the wt peptide as well as the peptide containing unmodified 1,3-diaminobenzoic acid (Fig. 3c). For DnaK, the Fmoc substituent did not dissociate the wt peptide while both other peptides dissociated the complex to a certain extent (Fig. 3d). These results indicate that Hsp70s differ in accommodating modified side chains in their binding pockets.
Docking of peptides 2 to 6 into BiP and DnaK led to increased distances of the bridging residues and only rare formation of the protein–peptide backbone hydrogen bond (Table S1). However, in most cases, the bridge was stabilized by additional interactions with the non-proteinogenic amino acid leading to stable binding (Fig. S4). In agreement with our experiments, similar peptide binding behavior was observed for BiP and DnaK, except for peptides 2 and 6 (Fig. S5). The latter is caused by differences in the plasticity of the BiP and DnaK binding sites: DnaK adapted to peptide 2 such that bridge formation was possible, whereas BiP could not (Fig. S5a and b). On the other hand, BiP formed stable complexes with peptide 6 with the large Fmoc group fitting well inside the binding pocket, whereas in DnaK, the Fmoc group could not enter the site (Fig. S5c and d). This indicates significant differences in the dynamics of the SBDs as the pockets' sequences are 100% conserved between BiP and DnaK.
The structural features of the binding sites for Hsp70 chaperones are still poorly understood. It is known that short stretches of amino acids are bound and that hydrophobic side chains are important for the formation of stable complexes. 5,7,8,10,28,40 In this work, we show directly that substrate conformation also plays an important role in the recognition process.
Importantly, for a mutation that changed the conformation and abolished binding (HTFPAVL to HTFAAVL), the hydrophobicity and the prediction of the BiP scoring algorithm28 were not altered while this was the case for the SVKPLAP mutant.
Due to its rigidity, the central Pro leads to a defined and stable conformation of its neighbor residues. This might explain the stronger binding of HTFPAVL compared to HTFAAVL, in which the combination of the two central small and flexible Ala residues leads to an overall increased peptide flexibility and thus destabilization of a stretched conformation with p4 located inside the central binding pocket. In agreement with this notion, peptides containing amino acid analogs with constraint ring structures bind efficiently to Hsp70s. In contrast, the stabilization of a kinked conformation by introducing 5-dimethyl-4-oxaproline reduced binding to BiP strongly. These observations suggest

the preferred binding of peptides in an extended conformation by Hsp70s.
In general, the hydrophobicity of Hsp70 binding sequences seems to have co-evolved with an extended conformation of the respective amino acid stretches. In agreement with this notion, most known Hsp70 binding sites are located in β-sheet regions and thus occur in an extended conformation. This concept is modulated by flexibility differences in the binding clefts of BiP and DnaK, which allows accommodation of various side-chain geometries as shown for non-natural amino acids.
Thus, efficient binding of a peptide to an Hsp70 member induces (i) an extended conformation of the peptide, which allows aligning with the binding pocket, and (ii) an induced-fit-like docking of the p4 side chain into the central binding pocket. These processes are followed by (iii) the closing of the loops L1–2 and L3–4 over the binding pocket for the formation of kinetically stable complexes.
