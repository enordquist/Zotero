In this work, we report a nanoﬂuidic gating mechanism that uses the thermal eﬀect for modulating the ionic transport inside nanoﬂuidic channels. The control of the ionic transport inside a nanochannel is demonstrated using electrical conductivity. A thermal gate controls the ionic transport more eﬀectively than most of the other gating mechanisms previously described in the scientiﬁc literature. Gating in both bulk and overlapping electric double layer regimes can be obtained. The relatively short response time of opening and closing processes makes it a good candidate for manipulating small molecules in microand nanoscale devices.

Controlling the fluidic and ionic transport inside nanochannels is one of the important applications of nanofluidics. Diﬀerent phenomena were introduced and utilized in nanofluidic channels and pores for controlling the ionic and molecular transport in nanometer scale conduits such as using the electrostatic field eﬀect,1–3 steric eﬀect4,5 and liquid reconfiguration.6,7 Since ions are the only carriers of electric current inside the nanofluidic channels, measuring the electric current across nanochannels has been used as a way to verify the opening or closing of the nanochannels.1–7
The ionic mobility of an electrolyte is sensitive to temperature. Consequently, the ionic transport and the electric current in aqueous solutions are dependent on temperature. At the micro and nanoscale, the variation of temperature influences the ionic transport not only by increasing the ionic mobility, but by modifying the channel wall surface properties which also has a significant impact on the ionic and fluidic transport.8–10 In particular, at the nanoscale, the ionic concentration, pH of the solution and the type and charge of the ions in solution as well as the number of binding sites on the nanochannel wall and equilibrium constants of the surface reactions can influence the temperature sensitivity of the ionic transport inside a nanofluidic channel. According to analytical modeling, the electric conductance of a nanofluidic channel can be increased by about two orders of magnitude by a temperature rise of 65 °C at a low ionic concentration for a silica nanochannel.10 This modulation factor can provide the possibility of gating in nanoscale fluidic channels.

To this aim, the nanofluidic device should have integrated heaters that can increase the nanochannel temperature. Moreover, the response time of the gate to the external stimuli needs to be small enough, so that the channel opening and closing occur on an acceptable time scale, which implies that the heating and cooling processes should be fast. Local heating of the nanochannel can decrease the response time as well as the required heat flux to assess a certain temperature. Joule heating of a thin layer of the metal that is embedded close to the nanochannel or using a plasmonic hot spot11,12 can appropriately heat up the nanochannel locally.
The local heating will generate a large thermal gradient, which may cause thermophoretic migrations.11,13 The thermophoretic migration of species inside an electrolyte depends on various factors such as salinity and temperature of the solution, size, charge and hydration shell of the solute as well as the interactions between diﬀerent solutes.12,13 The thermophoretic migration of species may cause a reduction or an increase of the electric current inside the nanochannel depending on the direction of migration.
We designed nanofluidic devices that use integrated microheaters in order to control the fluidic transport. The microheater is a 72 μm platinum electrode placed over a 500 nm silicon dioxide layer on top of an array of 40 parallel nanochannels of 110 μm length, 3 μm width and 40 nm height. The fabrication process is detailed in a previous publication.10 In brief, amorphous silicon was deposited and patterned as a sacrificial layer on a fused silica wafer to shape the nanochannels. This layer was then covered by a 500 nm silicon dioxide layer. The platinum electrodes were then integrated into the device using a normal lift-oﬀ technique. Another silicon dioxide layer then insulated the electrodes. The oxide layer was etched so that the amorphous silicon layer became accessible.

Finally, the amorphous silicon layer was released and the nanochannel became accessible.
Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the nanofluidic device that was mounted on a temperature-controlled mini-cool-plate that kept the external chip temperature at 3 ± 1 °C. A thermally conductive paste was used between the device and the plate in order to enhance the heat transfer. Working at low temperature helps to better illustrate the thermal gating phenomenon by increasing the working temperature range.
The gate is in an oﬀ-state when the temperature is low and it turns to an on-state by heating up the micro-heater and the nanochannel. Heating the nanochannel increases the surface charge of the silica nanochannel wall (Fig. 1b). The higher surface charge results in the attraction of a higher number of counter-ions towards the nanochannel. Under these

conditions, the ionic flow and the electric conductance will increase.
A relay switch circuit was used to control the on-state pulse time in order to have a unique on-state time in all measurements. Antisymmetric voltages were applied to the gate, so that the gate electric potential of the electrode over the nanochannel region was zero and no electrostatic gating eﬀect appeared inside the nanochannel. Two platinum microelectrodes were placed close to the nanochannel entrance (Fig. 1c) and used in electrical measurements of the nanochannel impedance. The nanochannel resistance was then screened at diﬀerent gate powers.
Fig. 1d depicts the temperature distribution inside the nanochannel while the 72 μm gate is at 100 °C. The average temperature inside the nanochannel is more than 90 °C while the reference temperature of the whole device is 3 ± 1 °C. This wide temperature range allows a higher level of modulation of the ionic transport. It is worth noting that the nanochannels are connected to large microscale reservoirs that are kept at a low temperature. The values presented in Fig. 1d result from a numerical simulation performed with COMSOL (COMSOL Multiphysics 4.4).

Results and discussion
The nanochannel was heated up by applying electric DC current to the thermal gate. The resistance of the nanochannel was then measured by applying an AC signal to the measuring electrodes (i in Fig. 1) and reading the current. Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the nanochannel resistance and the average temperature at diﬀerent values of applied power for a 1 mM

potassium chloride solution. Increasing the power decreases the nanochannel resistance. Correlating the power and the achieved electric conductance provides the possibility of controlling the eﬀectiveness of the thermal gate. The values of the power correspond to the proportion of power consumed in the nanochannel region of the gate electrode. The average temperature of the liquid inside the nanochannel was estimated by relating the resistance of the nanochannel at 1 M to temperature, where the change of conductivity is dominated by ionic mobility. In our previous work,10 we have shown that the temperature dependence of conductivity at a high salt concentration converges to the bulk values which are a = 1.8–2% °C−1 for the potassium chloride solution. To this aim, the temperature of the whole device was changed from 2 to 95 °C while it is in contact with a temperature controlled Peltier element. The electrical resistance of the nanochannel was calibrated such that it can be used to estimate the average temperature inside the nanochannel at diﬀerent applied gate powers for a 1 M solution. The nanochannel conductance measurements are taken after 1 minute in order to wait for thermal equilibrium. The results show that the resistance of the nanochannel at 1 mM is in line with the estimated average temperature. Based on the data from the temperature distribution (Fig. 1d), the temperature of the thermal gate is about 100 °C when a power of 570 mW is applied to the gate (VDC = 8.0 V).
We define the gate eﬀectiveness as the ratio of on- to oﬀstate conductance (Gon/Goﬀ ) in order to compare the performance of the gating methods under diﬀerent conditions. Fig. 3 depicts the eﬀectiveness of the thermal gate at diﬀerent ionic concentrations and for deionized water (18 MΩ cm). The thermal gate is able to increase the ionic flux by more

than one order of magnitude at low ionic concentrations. As mentioned before, the electrostatic field caused by the wall surface charge influences the ionic transport since the electric double layer (EDL) overlaps at a low ionic concentration. Heating the nanochannel will increase the surface charge density of the silica wall. More ions are attracted toward the nanochannel and its electric conductance increases. Moreover, heating up an aqueous solution increases the ionic mobility by decreasing its viscosity. This occurs for both the bulk and the overlapping EDL regimes. Therefore, a relatively small change in the electric conductance happens at high ionic concentrations. Although the eﬀectiveness is lower at high ionic concentrations, modulating the ionic transport at high ionic concentrations is a clear advantage of the thermal gating method over its electrostatic field eﬀect counterpart. The electrostatic field cannot be used to modulate the ionic transport at high ionic concentrations.
In order to clarify the eﬀect of the wall surface charge, the gating eﬀectiveness of 1 mM potassium chloride solutions at two diﬀerent pH values has been investigated. As the point of zero charge (PZC) for a silicon dioxide surface is at pH = 3, the surface charge of the nanochannel wall is very low at pH = 4, while a much higher negative charge is expected at pH = 7.14 Therefore, the dependence of the conductance of the nanochannel on the wall surface charge should be lower at pH = 4. Consequently, at this pH, the sensitivity of the wall surface charge to temperature is low and the increase of the electric conductance can only be related to the bulk eﬀects. Fig. 4 illus-

The power applied to a 2.5 mm in length gate electrode is 570 mW at ΔT = 90 °C. The gate eﬀectiveness is higher at low ionic concentrations. The nanochannel length is 110 μm while the width of the gate is only 72 μm. The error bars show the 95% conﬁdence interval for 5 measurements.

Fig. 4 Eﬀect of the wall surface charge on the gate eﬀectiveness. The ﬁgure compares the gate eﬀectiveness for a 1 mM potassium chloride solution at pH = 7 (red) to a solution of the same concentration and pH = 4 (blue) while the solution at 1 M (green) shows the bulk behavior. At pH = 4, the wall surface charge is low and consequently the sensitivity of the conductance of the nanochannel to the temperature is lower. Under these conditions, the increase of the nanochannel conductance is close to the one of the bulk. The nanochannel length is 110 μm while the width of the gate is only 72 μm. The error bars show the 95% conﬁdence interval for 5 measurements.

trates the contribution of the enhancement of the surface charge eﬀect due to the temperature increase for both solutions. A 1 M potassium chloride solution is used as a bulk control to demonstrate the ionic mobility dependence of the electric conductance only on the temperature. As shown in Fig. 4, the gate eﬀectiveness of the solution at pH = 4 is close to the bulk while there is a major increase at pH = 7. This diﬀerence emphasizes that the eﬀectiveness of the thermal gate is mainly caused by the unique nanofluidic eﬀect due to the charged wall. However, the eﬀectiveness at the bulk regime is still comparable to the ones of other gating methods. The complete theory was discussed in our previous work.10
Table 1 represents the values of the reported gate eﬀectiveness for various nanofluidic transport gates. The reported values are the maximum achieved performances in the mentioned publications. For the case of the electrostatic gating, the ratio of maximum to minimum electric conductance is defined as the gate eﬀectiveness. According to the table, the gate eﬀectiveness is less than 5 for most of the cases. A small value of the gate eﬀectiveness implies that the ionic transport can neither be stopped completely nor be enhanced considerably. Although the introduced gating methods are successful in modulating the ionic transport, they are still far from ideally opening and closing the nanochannel.
Some of the gating methods are limited by technological restrictions. For example, the eﬀectiveness of the field eﬀect gates is limited by the breakdown of the dielectric layer. Additionally, having the gate electrode only on one side of the nanochannel wall decreases the eﬀectiveness of the field eﬀect

a Gate eﬀectiveness is defined as the ratio of on- to oﬀ-state conductance. For the case of the field eﬀect, the maximum and minimum achieved conductance is considered as the open- and closed-state, respectively.

gate in a nanochannel platform2 while the gate eﬀectiveness of a similar gate electrode surrounded nanotube is doubled.3
The eﬀectiveness of the thermal gating method exceeds one order of magnitude at low ionic concentrations while other gating methods have considerably lower eﬀectiveness. Heating the nanochannel does not need a complicated microfabrication process. Moreover, the thermal gate does not suﬀer from the limitations in device manufacturing such as dielectric breakdown limitations for the field eﬀect gating method. However, the thermal eﬀect used in thermal gating may limit the choice of molecules used in such a system to the ones that can withstand the local temperature reached inside the nanochannel. Depending on the local temperature reached during thermal gating some biomolecules such as proteins may be detrimental.
Thermal gating can be fast. Its response time is determined, on the one hand, by the thermal diﬀusivity of the materials, which determines the dynamical temperature profile, and on the other hand, by the ion diﬀusion and the reaction rate of surface reactions, which determine the dynamical ion concentration profile in the case of change of surface charge. In Fig. 5, some examples of the applied thermal pulses are depicted. 200 ms pulses (left side of Fig. 5a) have higher eﬀectiveness than 50 ms pulses (right side). Fig. 5b shows the opening and closing process of a single 200 ms pulse. The closing process needs more time than the opening one. In our particular design, the typical closing time is about τc ≅ 400 ms whereas the opening is much faster. The closing time is indicated by τc in the figure. As depicted in Fig. 5c, for longer pulses, we clearly see the thermal time constant in both opening and closing transitions.
The pulses in Fig. 5a–c correspond to a 1 M ionic concentration, which we consider as bulk regime ionic transport. Therefore, the result can represent the average temperature inside the nanochannel at any ionic concentration using the calibration that was performed before (see Fig. 2). Alternatively, it can represent the proportion of the ionic mobility in the enhancement of the ionic transport. At lower ionic concentrations, the additional eﬀect of the surface charge appears.
Fig. 5d depicts 5 s pulses at diﬀerent ionic concentrations. First, it emphasizes the additional increase of the gate eﬀectiveness at low ionic concentrations that occurs only in the EDL overlapping regime. Secondly, it shows that the gating dynamics at low ionic concentrations is diﬀerent from the bulk regime. As represented in Fig. 5d, the electric conductance does not settle down instantly to its oﬀ-state value. By switching the gate oﬀ, the electric conductance decreases to a value higher than the normal oﬀ-state. This decrease occurs in a time in the order of τc. Then, it decreases to the normal value of the oﬀ-state with a slower rate. Thus, the slower rate of settling down cannot be justified by the temperature. Besides, this eﬀect appears only at low ionic concentrations where the nanofluidic regime occurs. In other words, it is dependent on the surface charge of the nanochannel.

(d) Comparison of 5 s pulses at 1 M (dotted line), 1 mM (dashed line) ionic concentrations and DI water (solid line). The vertical axis shows the ratio of on- to oﬀ-state conductance. At low ionic concentration, the conductance needs excess time to stabilize which results from the dynamical ion concentration proﬁle.

Conclusion
We demonstrated the possibility of controlling the ionic transport in nanochannels using thermal gating for the first time. A thermal gate modulates the ionic transport by heating up the nanochannel. It increases the ionic transport via raising both the ionic mobility and the surface charge of the nanochannel wall. The surface charge of a silica nanochannel wall increases with temperature. The higher temperature of the nanochannel changes the equilibrium constant of the reactions at the surface such that a higher number of negatively charged sites are present on the surface. This results in an additional electrostatic eﬀect that does not occur in bulk regimes. The dependency of the ionic transport on temperature in bulk regimes is attributed only to the increased ionic mobility with temperature.
According to the two mentioned mechanisms, the eﬀectiveness of the thermal gating is dependent on the ionic concentration. At low ionic concentrations, a high eﬀectiveness is achieved while it decreases by increasing the ionic concentration. In contrast to the field eﬀect gating method, the thermal gating can still modulate the ionic transport at bulk regimes.
The thermal gate eﬀectiveness was compared to other gating mechanisms. The thermal gate has a higher eﬀectiveness and requires less technological restrictions compared to other gating mechanisms.

The thermal gate is fast enough to be used for the manipulation of small molecules inside nanofluidic channels. A response time in the order of tens of milliseconds was observed for the opening process. The closing process needs hundreds of milliseconds at the maximum achieved eﬀectiveness.
The thermal gate can be used in applications that require controlling the ionic or fluidic transport at the small scale. The thermal gate has the possibility of being stimulated remotely, which is an advantage over the field eﬀect gating method. It can remotely control the delivery process of sub-femtoliter volumes.
