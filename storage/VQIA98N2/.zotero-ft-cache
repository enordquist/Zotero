Abstract
Water molecules conﬁned to nonpolar pores and cavities of nanoscopic dimensions exhibit highly unusual properties. Water ﬁlling is strongly cooperative, with the possible coexistence of ﬁlled and empty states and sensitivity to small perturbations of the pore polarity and solvent conditions. Conﬁned water molecules form tightly hydrogen-bonded wires or clusters. The weak attractions to the conﬁning wall, combined with strong interactions between water molecules, permit exceptionally rapid water ﬂow, exceeding expectations from macroscopic hydrodynamics by several orders of magnitude. The proton mobility along 1D water wires also substantially exceeds that in the bulk. Proteins appear to exploit these unusual properties of conﬁned water in their biological function (e.g., to ensure rapid water ﬂow in aquaporins or to gate proton ﬂow in proton pumps and enzymes). The unusual properties of water in nonpolar conﬁnement are also relevant to the design of novel nanoﬂuidic and molecular separation devices or fuel cells.

INTRODUCTION
“Oil and water do not mix.” This everyday observation is the quintessential hydrophobic effect. At the molecular level, hydrophobic effects are thought to drive a variety of biological and colloidal self-assembly phenomena in aqueous solution, including the folding of proteins and the formation of micelles and membranes. Naturally, investigators have focused much attention on the hydration thermodynamics of nonpolar molecules in water and their water-mediated hydrophobic interactions. In essence, those studies show that small hydrophobic solutes are insoluble in water primarily because of a large entropic penalty commonly associated with a perturbation of the vicinal water structure. Such descriptions, however, tell only half the story.
Much less studied is the other half: the low solubility of water in oil. Wolfenden & Radzicka (1) found that the equilibrium concentration of water in nonpolar solvents is indeed low, making them literally hydrophobic. For the transfer of water from vapor into cyclohexane and heptane, the equilibrium constant is approximately one at ambient conditions, corresponding to a water concentration of ∼10−3 mol per liter, or approximately one water molecule per 1000 nm3. Clearly, this low solubility originates from the lack of strong attractive interactions between water and the nonpolar molecules. Furthermore, the relative lack of free volume formed through transient density ﬂuctuations in nonpolar solvents (2) keeps the water concentration almost as low as that in vapor.
Would water occupy nonpolar molecule-size cavities if they were preformed, instead of being formed transiently? Answers from experiments are far from conclusive. The well-deﬁned structures of folded proteins contain cavities, caused by packing imperfections or engineered by site-directed mutagenesis. Researchers have studied the hydration of the protein interior in great detail (3–13). Remarkably, there is no general consensus regarding whether typical nonpolar cavities inside proteins are water ﬁlled or empty, and even in speciﬁc cases the results of different experimental probes diverge (4, 6, 8).
From a fundamental perspective, water is expected to recede from nonpolar interfaces and cavities. Invoking the contact theorem of statistical mechanics, Stillinger (14) argued more than 30 years ago that a liquid water phase at ambient conditions does not wet a hard wall, but instead forms a water-vapor interface near the wall. Recent theoretical developments (15) and related simulation studies (16, 17) span the length-scale-dependent hydration of hard-sphere solutes from molecular to macroscopic sizes (18). Water molecules pack well near small solutes, thus wetting the interface; with increasing solute size, water dewets hard-solute surfaces. This crossover from wet to dry interfaces begins at subnanometer length scales.
For the concave surface of a pore or cavity, such drying effects should become even more pronounced, with water molecules subjected to an effective cavity expulsion (19) owing to the lack of hydrogen-bonding interactions with the conﬁning volume. Indeed, computer simulations by Wallqvist & Berne (20) showed such drying between ellipsoidal purely repulsive plates. However, realistic systems exert attractive van der Waals and polarizability-induced interactions with water. These weak attractions can

become strong enough such that a low-order perturbative treatment must include the coexistence of both dry and wet states to adequately describe the system (21, 22).
The question of water in nonpolar conﬁnement is not only of academic interest. In many proteins, nonpolar cavities are often located at or near the active site and are thought to be involved in the uptake, transfer, and release of both nonpolar and polar molecules. In particular, nonpolar or weakly polar pores play a prominent role in aquaporin water channels, the biological proton pumps cytochrome c oxidase and bacteriorhodopsin (23), cytochrome P450 (24, 25), and the gating region of potassium channels (26, 27). In all these systems, evidence is accumulating that water occupies their weakly polar pores at least transiently.
The penetration of water into nonpolar pores is also of technological relevance, in part building on the rapid advances in nanoscale synthesis. Initial computer simulations (21, 28, 29) and subsequent experiments (30, 31) suggest that water can ﬂow through hydrophobic nanopores with greatly reduced wall friction, exceeding ﬂow rates predicted by the macroscopic Hagen-Poiseuille law by three to four orders of magnitude. Combined with chemical selectivity (32, 33), such as ion exclusion from the pores (28), the possibility emerges of building efﬁcient molecular separation devices (34), and maybe even novel desalination technology (28, 35), based on materials with nanoscopic nonpolar pores. Lastly, if the challenge of low proton density in nonpolar pores can be solved (36), the single-ﬁle hydrogen-bonded water wires in highly conﬁned nanopores (Figure 1) would form ideal proton conduction wires (36–39), with potential applications in fuel cells, for instance (36, 40).
Here we review recent efforts to quantify the thermodynamics of water ﬁlling nonpolar or weakly polar pores and conﬁnements [including those in carbon nanotubes (CNTs), fullerenes, and proteins] and characterize the unique properties of water in such nonpolar conﬁnements. We then discuss the implications of these results on the function of biomolecular systems and possible applications.

THERMODYNAMICS, STRUCTURE, AND KINETICS OF WATER FILLING NONPOLAR PORES AND CAVITIES

Theory

If particle exchange between the cavity and the bulk solvent is not fast on the simulation timescale, one can establish a virtual particle equilibrium using a grand-canonical formalism. We consider a probe volume V covering a cavity of interest in a molecular system embedded within a larger volume V in a canonical ensemble at temperature T. The subvolume V is in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding, and in chemical equilibrium with a water bath at a total chemical potential μ. The probability of observing exactly N particles in the volume V is then given by

In a plot of ln pins,N/ prem,N+1 against U, the slope should be β, and the intercept with U = 0 gives the excess chemical potential of the conﬁned water, −βμeNx = ln exp[−β(UN+1 −UN)] N. Equation 3 thus allows one not only to calculate the excess chemical potential of the conﬁned water μeNx, but also to test whether the conﬁned water is in proper thermal and chemical equilibrium.
The procedure involves performing a series of simulations with different occupan-
cies N = 1, 2, . . . , Nmax and combining the insertion and removal energy distributions from simulations with N and N + 1 particles, respectively, to estimate e −β(UN+1−UN) N via Equation 3. Recursive application of Equation 2 then gives P (N )/P (0) for N ≥ 1, and ﬁnally, P (0) = −1 is found by normalization (22, 42). The resulting average water occupancy N is related to the differences in the excess chemical potentials of water in the interior (cavity) and exterior (bulk). From Equation 2, we ﬁnd that N = N NP(N ) = ρ Ve −β(μex−μebxulk), where exp(−βμex) = N P (N ) exp(−βμeNx) is the average excess chemical potential of water in the cavity (42).
We can also discuss the thermodynamics of conﬁned water in terms of the free
energy of transfer from an external water reservoir. We rewrite Equation 1 as P(N ) = −1 exp(βμN − β AN), where AN is the Helmholtz free energy of the system with
N water molecules in V (42) and μ is the total chemical potential of the bulk ﬂuid. Because P (0) = −1, AN can be determined from the ratio of probabilities in ﬁlled and empty states. The Helmholtz free energy of N water molecules in the bulk ﬂuid is AN,bulk = μN − p VN,bulk, where p is the pressure and VN,bulk is the volume of N water molecules in the bulk phase.
Through Equation 1 and P (0) = −1, the free energy AN of the transfer of exactly N water molecules from the bulk phase into the probe volume V is related to the occupancy probabilities P(N) by AN = AN − AN,bulk = −kB T ln P (N )/P (0) + p VN,bulk. Near ambient conditions, the pressure-volume term is small, p VN,bulk/N ≈ 0.002 kJ mol−1 (22, 42), and can be neglected. From the temperature dependence
of AN = UN − T SN, we can estimate the internal energy UN and entropy SN = −∂ AN/∂ T of water in the conﬁned system relative to bulk water. We note
in particular that if (for a given occupancy N) the energy and entropy of transfer are essentially constant over a small temperature range, a plot of −N−1 ln[P (N )/P (0)] versus T−1 furnishes UN/N and SN/N from the slope and intercept, respectively. For protein cavities, an approximate procedure has been used to estimate the energy of
transfer (43). If the cavity is relatively rigid, such that protein and solvent reorganiza-
tion energies are small, then the energy difference can be approximated as UN/N ≈ Urem N/N − Urem bulk/2, where Urem N is the average removal energy of the entire N water cluster from the cavity, and Urem bulk/2 = U bulk is half the removal energy for bulk water, which corresponds to the average total energy per particle.
A global free-energy minimum at a nonzero occupancy N > 0 implies that ﬁlling is favored at that occupancy. In this case, a free-energy barrier usually exists between the

Figure 2
Thermodynamics of water ﬁlling a cavity. The amount of water in a cavity is governed by the difference between the excess chemical potential inside and in the bulk. This difference is sensitive to changes in internal factors (such as the polarity of the cavity, van der Waals attractions, internal electric ﬁelds, and shape ﬂuctuations), as well as external factors acting on the bulk phase (such as pressure, osmolyte concentration, or external electric ﬁelds).

occupied and empty states; the barrier partially controls the kinetics of emptying and ﬁlling. Additional factors that determine the kinetics are frictional resistance along the reaction path and end effects such as density ﬂuctuations and energy barriers near the entrance to the cavity or CNT (44). When the free energy of transfer to ﬁlled states is near zero and an easily accessible low-friction path exists between the states, the system ﬂuctuates between empty and ﬁlled states over timescales governed by the barrier and temperature (45).
Factors Controlling the Thermodynamics of Filling A number of factors determine the difference in excess chemical potential of water inside and outside a cavity. Filling can be achieved by making either the excess chemical potential in the cavity interior favorable or the outside unfavorable (Figure 2).
Attractive interactions and local polarity. Simulations of a narrow CNT (∼0.8-nm diameter) immersed in water showed that a small reduction of the van der Waals attraction between water and the carbon atoms induces drying of the previously water-ﬁlled pore (21, 45). Sensitivity of the water occupancy to changes in the geometry and interaction energy with the surrounding medium was observed also for other systems (46–58). The water contact angle with graphitic surfaces was similarly found to be sensitive to graphite-water interactions (59).
Figure 3 illustrates the drying of a solvated CNT upon weakening the carbonwater attractive interactions. The depth of carbon-water pair interaction potentials differs by only approximately 0.05 kcal mol−1 (less than 0.1 kB T ) in the two cases.

In contrast, the probability P(N ) of ﬁnding exactly N water molecules inside the tube is signiﬁcantly different. It is sharply centered around the fully ﬁlled state (N = 5) for a system with full-strength carbon-water interactions and becomes bimodal when attractions are reduced. The free energy of occupancy ﬂuctuations, F (N ) = −kB T ln P (N ), shown in Figure 3 highlights the difference clearly.
The weakened carbon-water attractions primarily increase the excess chemical potential of water inside the nanotube. As the excess chemical potential of the conﬁned water approaches that of bulk water, and eventually exceeds it, the system could respond in two ways. In a gas-like response, the conﬁned water would simply dilute,

resulting in fragmentation of the hydrogen-bonded water wire. Alternatively, in a liquid-like response, the system would separate into a gas-like essentially empty state and a liquid-like ﬁlled state. On a microscopic scale, the two phases cannot coexist. Instead the system ﬂuctuates between a water-ﬁlled and empty state. A relatively high free-energy barrier between the two states reﬂects the high energetic cost of fragmented hydrogen bonds and ensures that the transitions are two-state-like (21, 45).
This sensitivity highlights the challenge of making quantitative predictions with molecular force ﬁelds that neglect, for example, polarizability effects, or the speciﬁc chemistry at the CNT rims. Nevertheless, important qualitative trends, such as the cooperative drying of pores upon weakening the attractions, should be properly captured, and accurate predictions of drying thermodynamics have been made (9).
Solvent conditions: temperature, pressure, osmolyte concentration. The ﬁlling equilibrium can also be affected by changing the excess chemical potential of water on the outside, for example, by applying pressure or adding salts or osmolytes that do not penetrate the tube. For a structurally pressure-stable cavity, the excess chemical potential inside is barely affected by pressure; outside, however, pressure increases the chemical potential according to (∂μ/∂ p)T = 1/ρ. For bulk water, a pressure increase to 1 kbar (100 MPa) raises the total chemical potential by approximately 2 kJ mol−1, a change that can be sufﬁcient to tilt the balance from a previously empty toward a ﬁlled state. Experiment and simulation demonstrated such water ﬁlling for a nonpolar cavity inside the L99A mutant of the protein T4 lysozyme (Figure 4) (9, 60).
Interestingly, temperature appears to have only a modest effect on the water occupancy of nonpolar cavities. We probed the temperature-dependent occupancy of CNT pores (42), fullerenes, and simple spherical cavities (22), as well as that of cavities in proteins by molecular simulations. The entropy of transferring water from the bulk into the channel of narrow CNTs (Figure 1a) was near zero even in the completely ﬁlled state (42), reﬂecting that water in 1D wires retains considerable rotational entropy, with a dangling hydrogen able to rotate about the water-wire axis. However, we note that the thermodynamics of transfer differs for isolated tubes and tubes open to a bulk-water reservoir. In open, partially ﬁlled tubes, water molecules typically remain hydrogen bonded to the external solvent, thereby lowering both their energy and entropy (42a; A. Waghe, unpublished manuscript).
For water in spherical pores, the entropy of transfer was found to be negative for the ﬁlled state (22). We obtained similar results for the nonpolar cavities of the protein tetrabrachion (43) (Figure 5c). Dunitz (61), based on the entropies of hydration water in crystals and in bulk, argued for slightly unfavorable entropies of water in protein cavities. Denisov et al. (62), based on nuclear-magnetic-resonance data and a model for librational motion, suggested that the entropy of water transfer into less polar cavities may even be positive (i.e., favorable). Collectively, the above arguments and simulation data suggest that temperature has only a modest inﬂuence on the water occupancy in a narrow CNT pore, but favors the empty states of spherical-shape nonpolar cavities, and in proteins.

Electric ﬁeld. The effect of electric ﬁelds on water permeation though nanopores was studied in simulations (42, 63–65). Dzubiella et al. (63) showed that water permeation can be controlled and enhanced by electric ﬁelds. Vaitheeswaran et al. (42) found that an electric ﬁeld along the axis of a narrow CNT favors ﬁlling and orients the water dipoles in the tube in the direction of the ﬁeld, with the ﬁeld effects described nearly quantitatively by a model with only two dipolar states (collectively pointing up or down) and two ﬁlling states (empty or ﬁlled).
Electric ﬁelds can also have more complicated effects on conﬁned water. Zimmerli et al. (66) found that local electric ﬁelds perturbed both the dipolar orientation and the ﬁlling of CNTs. Li et al. (64) showed that the electric ﬁeld of a charge localized near a narrow CNT leads to increased ordering of the water along the pore axis,

thereby reducing the rate of water transport across the pore. In simulations of proton transport along ordered water chains, Hassan et al. (38) found that local electric ﬁelds either enhance the proton transfer rate or slow it down, depending on the ﬁeld strength and the resulting perturbation of the water structure and electrostatics. Even the presence of ions in solution localized near the pore was found to affect the structure and dynamics of water inside (63, 65). Sufﬁciently large electric ﬁelds applied between small graphene sheets in water were shown to induce drying instead of causing the increase in the water density expected from linear polarization response at low ﬁelds (53). However, simulations of water in nanopores have also shown conventional electrostriction in contrast to the above result (67).

Conformational ﬂexibility. Changes in the conformational ﬂexibility can also affect the equilibrium between ﬁlled and empty states. As Andreev et al. (68) demonstrated using computer simulations, water was effectively squeezed out of a small CNT in water that was artiﬁcially made more ﬂexible. The main effect appeared to be a reduction in the free volume of the conﬁned water molecules, which are thereby forced into an energetically less favorable straight arrangement. Moreover, in the water-ﬁlled state, low-frequency modes of the tube are suppressed. Both effects help shift the equilibrium toward the empty state. In the case of proteins, simulations by

Damjanovic´ et al. (69) also suggested that ﬂexible, small, nonpolar cavities tend to be empty.
Structure of Water in Nonpolar Conﬁnement Subnanometer conﬁnement strongly affects the molecular properties of ﬂuids (21, 70–73) and, in particular, their structure. For water in nonpolar conﬁnement, a main factor is the formation of strong hydrogen bonds (21, 72, 74, 150).
Spherical pores. The almost-spherical and nonpolar internal cavities of fullerenes (C140 and C180) have sufﬁcient space to accommodate hydrogen-bonded clusters of several water molecules (22). For graphene-like cavity-water interactions, the free energy of transfer of water from a reservoir into a cavity displays two-state behavior, with minima at N = 0 (empty/dry) and N > 0 (ﬁlled), when the cavity diameter exceeds ∼1 nm. Smaller cavities remain empty at room temperature and pressure. Reducing the cavity-water attraction leads to drying of cavities in equilibrium with bulk water for all cavity sizes. However, Iwamatsu et al. (75) demonstrated in their experiments using toluene-water mixtures that even the small cavity of an open-cage C60 derivative could be ﬁlled by water, reﬂecting an increased chemical potential of water on the outside.
As the occupancy of a cavity increases, the formation of water-water hydrogen bonds decreases the system enthalpy. Cavity-water attraction provides essentially a mean ﬁeld contribution that lowers the enthalpy. In contrast, the entropy of transfer is favorable (positive) for low occupancies and gradually becomes less favorable with rising occupancy, reﬂecting hydrogen-bond formation and loss of free volume.
The structures of encapsulated water clusters (Figure 5b) shed light on the origin of their thermodynamic stability. The smallest marginally stable cluster, observed in simulations of a cavity of 1.0-nm diameter, has three water molecules hydrogen bonded in a triangle conﬁguration (22). As the diameter increases, cyclic structures evolve from trimers to hexamers, with each water molecule donating and accepting a hydrogen bond. In a pentamer, the ﬁfth water oxygen moves out of the plane of the other four oxygen atoms to relieve the ring strain. The water hexamer shows coexistence between ring- and cage-like structures. Interestingly, the properties of some highly structured water clusters in the simulations are similar to those found experimentally in the gas phase (76). Cavity encapsulation may thus provide a means to study the properties of water clusters, especially when they are unstable or not easily prepared in an unconﬁned state. Differences in structural details motivate simulations with better water models (22, 77).
Cylindrical pores. Open-ended CNTs and other cylindrical nanopores allow easy access for solvent water molecules and can be ﬁlled under appropriate thermodynamic or solution conditions, as shown not only by simulation (21) but also by electron microscopy (78), X-ray and neutron scattering (79, 80), light spectroscopy (81), and nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy (82–84). Water ﬁlling of CNTs had indeed been predicted based on the macroscopic surface tension (85). The water structure

in the well-deﬁned conﬁnement of CNTs displays a remarkable diversity depending on pore size, temperature, and pressure. In tubes having small yet ﬁllable internal pore diameters [e.g., (5,5) or (6,6) CNTs], water molecules form single-ﬁle hydrogenbonded (typically unidirectional) wires (21) (see also the discussion of proton transport and aquaporin, below). As the tube diameter is increased, more water molecules access the interior, and increasingly more complex layered structures emerge. At ambient or higher temperatures, the conﬁned water is in a liquid phase, in which thermal ﬂuctuations coarse grain water’s tendency to form speciﬁc many-body hydrogenbonded structures. Lowering the temperature (in the range of 280–260 K), however, leads to solidiﬁcation and new and interesting phases of high-density ice, as seen in computer simulations (86) and experiments (79, 83). These quasi-1D crystalline ice phases are characterized by stacking of n-membered rings in the axial direction (n = 4–7, with increasing tube diameter from 1.1 to 1.4 nm). Water molecules in these rings typically satisfy ice rules with each water molecule being a double donor and acceptor of hydrogen bonds (87). The presence of a defect can lead to interesting helical structures in the tube.
Transition to and the thermodynamic stability of the quasi-1D ice phases are also fundamentally interesting. For example, the transition from square liquid-disordered to crystalline-ordered ice phases (n = 4) upon cooling in (14,14) CNTs is continuous, whereas the liquid to hexagonal-ring stacked ice phase transition in a (16,16) tube is discontinuous ﬁrst-order-like (86, 88). Systematic exploration of the pressuretemperature space for transitions in (14,14) CNTs indicates the presence of a solidliquid critical point (86), which is absent in the bulk water phase. A more recent extension of these studies to pressures exceeding 1 GPa indicates the formation of helical multiwalled ice phases in CNTs (89) (Figure 6). These studies bring out the remarkable ability of water molecules to adapt to nanoscopic conﬁnements by forming hydrogen-bonded arrangements that are essentially absent in bulk. However, ordered structures inside CNTs are not unique to water. For instance, 1D ionic crystals in equilibrium with a disordered solution phase have been reported (90, 91).

Water between plates. Theory and simulations indicate drying between strongly hydrophobic plates in water separated by a few nanometers or less (15, 52). However, under conditions that permit water ﬁlling of the space between plates (i.e., if the plates are sufﬁciently polar or for certain bulk solvent conditions), unique water structures in planar conﬁnement were observed in simulations. For example, for water sandwiched between CNT membranes at molecular separations (28), a water monolayer was found to be in equilibrium with the bulk phase. The resulting water structure is templated by the membrane surfaces and clearly shows meshed inner 6membered and outer 12-membered ring-like arrangements even at 300 K. Another recent study shows that water between hydrophobic plates separated by 6 A˚ can freeze into a bilayer ice crystalline phase at 300 K and pressures above 0.1 GPa (92). No such freezing was observed when the plates were hydrophilic, indicating the importance of water-water hydrogen-bonding interactions in hydrophobic conﬁnements.
Water in Protein Cavities Although tightly packed overall, many folded proteins contain a number of interior cavities or pores large enough to hold water or other small molecules. These cavities can serve as functionally relevant access channels or binding sites for substrates or products. Interestingly, a number of internal cavities are lined with predominantly nonpolar groups, and the experimental results for the hydration of such cavities are not entirely clear. X-ray crystallography often ﬁnds nonpolar cavities to be empty (3, 8), with some exceptions (6, 93); in contrast, nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy has provided evidence for the presence of water in weakly polar cavities (4, 5). On the theoretical side, a large number of studies using, for example, energetic estimates (94), molecular simulations (95–97), and statistical-mechanical theory (98, 99) have explored the hydration of proteins and nucleic acids. In many interesting cases of larger cavities, occupancy by multiple water molecules presents a challenge, making entropic considerations relevant and requiring formalisms as described above.
Lysozyme. High-pressure X-ray crystallography combined with molecular simulations (9, 60) permitted the ﬁrst direct experimental observation of a molecular drying transition. For the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme, high-pressure experiments showed that the overall structure of the protein changed minimally over the pressure range of 0–200 MPa, even around a cavity large enough to hold approximately ﬁve water molecules. At ambient pressure, the cavity was found to be empty based on the absence of appreciable electron density. However, above pressures of ∼1 kbar (100 MPa), the electron density increased sharply with pressure (Figure 4b), indicating a cooperative water-ﬁlling transition. Indeed, molecular dynamics simulations using the above methodology (9, 60) supported such a ﬁlling transition (Figure 4c). The simulations agreed quantitatively with the integrated electron density as a function of pressure after only a small correction (by 1 kJ mol−1 or 0.4 kB T ) in the bulk water chemical potential of the water model (Figure 4b). Simulations also provide additional structural details on water in the cavity. Speciﬁcally, a cluster of four water molecules with tight intracluster hydrogen bonds was observed (Figure 4a). Finally, the molecular dynamics simulations also gave evidence for the water access and exit pathway.

Exit events from different ﬁlling states were found to take the same path through the protein, involving the transient opening of a gate formed by a phenylalanine side chain. Interestingly, and consistent with this observation, the phenylalanine side chain showed considerably larger conformational motion in the crystal than other phenylalanines, as measured by its crystallographic B factor (9, 60).
Tetrabrachion. Arguably the largest nonpolar protein cavity discovered so far is located inside tetrabrachion (100). The cavity is large enough to hold nine water molecules (Figure 5) and was found to be completely ﬁlled in a low-temperature (100 K) X-ray structure (100). Tetrabrachion is unusual in other ways: It remains stable at high temperatures, requiring extreme conditions for denaturation (6 mol per liter guanidine at 130◦C) (101). The right-handed coiled-coiled structure of this unusual protein has additional cavities, connected by a narrow central channel along its axis (100). Simulations employing the above formalism (43) explored whether the conﬁned water is thermodynamically stable at ambient conditions and the temperature of optimal growth of the thermophilic organism, 365 K (92◦C); if the cavity dries before the protein denatures; and what possible functional role those large nonpolar cavities might play.
The free-energy proﬁles as a function of the occupancy (Figure 5c) have two minima, corresponding to the empty state, N = 0, and the ﬁlled state containing between 6 and 10 water molecules (Figure 5a). At 298 and 365 K, the free energy of transfer to the ﬁlled state is negative, and the cavity remains preferentially ﬁlled rather than empty. The transfer of one or two water molecules is unfavorable despite the presence of carbonyl oxygen atoms in the cavity walls as hydrogen-bonding sites and the large size of the cavity. The most probable occupancy numbers (N = 7 and 8 at 365 and 298 K, respectively) are in agreement with experiment (N = 9 at 100 K). Similar agreement was found for the smaller cavity ﬁlled by ﬁve water molecules (43).
The energy and entropy of transfer of one and two water molecules from the bulk phase into the cavity are positive but decrease with increasing occupancy to become negative beyond N = 3 (Figure 5). This decrease reﬂects energy-entropy compensation associated with hydrogen-bond formation in a connected water cluster.
One can infer the temperature at which the cavity dries from the calculated transfer energies and entropies, which are nearly independent of temperature. Remarkably, this drying temperature of ∼384 K is just above the temperature of optimal growth (365 K) and well below the unfolding temperature. At the optimal-growth temperature, the cavity thus may be near the coexistence of ﬁlled and empty states. As a possible functional role, the cavity might be involved in the hydrophobic anchoring of a protease to tetrabrachion (43), which was shown to be attached on top of the cavity site at temperatures up to ∼120◦C (101).
Alzheimer’s Aβ amyloids. Interestingly, quasi-1D water wires have also been seen in simulations of Alzheimer’s Aβ amyloid ﬁbrils (102, 103), one in a predominantly nonpolar pore along the ﬁbril axis and the other in a mixed polar/nonpolar pore facing an interior salt bridge. However, at present their biological relevance is not clear.

MOLECULAR FLOW THROUGH NONPOLAR NANOPORES
Water Flow
Molecular pores that communicate with ﬂuid reservoirs form possible conduits for nanoscale ﬂuid ﬂows. In biological systems, aquaporin proteins (104–111) mediate the ﬂow of water across lipid membranes. At their narrowest region, these channels are just wide enough for water molecules to pass through, thereby providing size selectivity, but also imposing single-ﬁle motions. Interestingly, a signiﬁcant fraction of the pore surface was found to be only weakly polar (104–106).
CNTs provide simple model systems to explore nanoscale hydrodynamic ﬂows and their molecular characteristics. In a simulation of a narrow CNT immersed in water, we observed a burst-like ﬂow of water across the pore (21). The stochastic character of the ﬂow could be described quantitatively in terms of a continuous-time random walk (29, 44) in which the water chain spanning the pore makes collective back-and-forth motions, thereby randomly releasing water molecules on one side and picking up new ones on the other. Averaged over time, such an unbiased random walk does not lead to any net ﬂow.
Zhu et al. (112) simulated ﬂow in an asymmetric environment by applying a pressure gradient across a membrane channel. To study osmotically driven ﬂow, as in biological systems, Kalra et al. (28) constructed water-permeable membranes by packing short and narrow CNTs into a 2D hexagonal array (Figure 1b). Under 3D periodic boundary conditions, two such membranes divide the simulation cell into two separate solvent compartments (113), one of them ﬁlled with pure water, the other with a concentrated salt solution. The (6,6) CNTs (∼0.8-nm diameter) were too narrow for ion passage (27, 28). The resulting osmotic imbalance created the driving force for a stochastic water ﬂow from the pure-water compartment across the CNT membranes into the salt-solution compartment. For a gradient created by a C ≈ 6 mol per liter NaCl solution, the rate of water ﬂow per CNT was approximately j = 5 water molecules per nanosecond, corresponding to an osmotic permeability coefﬁcient (112, 114) of approximately p f = j/ C ≈ 10−12 cm3 s−1, which is roughly a factor of ten larger than that measured for aquaporin AQP1 (115). Considering that single-ﬁle ﬂow dominates in both the CNTs and AQP1, and that the constriction in AQP1 has similar dimensions, this order-of-magnitude agreement is not entirely surprising.
Having a smooth pore of low polarity appears to be a key factor for the fast ﬂow rates seen in the simulations. As the water molecules pass through the pore, they do not form strong interactions with the pore, and therefore cannot transfer translational momentum to it. Correspondingly, the ﬂow friction is very low. Indeed, wall friction is so low that the ﬂow rate is nearly independent of the tube’s length in the regime up to several nanometers probed by simulations (28). Instead, water ﬂow is limited by molecular events associated with water entry into the tube and exit from it. Importantly, the resulting water ﬂow rates are much larger than those predicted from the Hagen-Poiseuille formula of macroscopic hydrodynamics.
Recent experiments for ﬂuid ﬂow through membrane-embedded CNTs broadly conﬁrmed the simulation results of fast water ﬂow through CNTs (30, 31, 116, 117).

With diameters of 1–2 nm, the pores in Holt et al.’s (31) experiments were only slightly wider than in the simulations (21, 28). Both the experiments of Holt et al. (31) and Majumder et al. (30) gave water ﬂow rates that exceeded the Hagen-Poiseuille values by factors of ∼1000 and more.
Ion Transport Ions are well hydrated in aqueous solutions, with the favorable enthalpy owing to ionwater interactions. The partitioning of ions into a narrow CNT requires them to shed a signiﬁcant fraction of their hydration shell water (118), thereby increasing both the barrier for partitioning as well as the free energy of transfer into the interior (119). Indeed, we found a membrane comprising (6,6) CNTs to be impermeable to sodium and chloride ions, and therefore it could be used to pump water osmotically (27, 28). High barriers for ion permeation were also observed by Sansom and collaborators (120).
Interestingly, the interior of somewhat larger CNTs can accommodate sufﬁcient water molecules for it to retain at least some of its ability to dissolve ions. Simulations of ion permeation through CNT membranes (27) showed that pores with an effective, water-accessible diameter of ∼1 nm were permeable to sodium ions. In those pores, the ions retained their ﬁrst hydration shell, resulting in a free-energy barrier for translocation of only a few kB T. Dzubiella and colleagues’ (63, 65) simulations showed further that local electric ﬁelds can affect the ion permeation. Remarkably, the nonpolar pores in the gating region of potassium channels have dimensions of ∼0.4 and ∼1.2 nm in the closed and open states, respectively (26, 121). The simulations (27, 120) suggest that this rather modest change is sufﬁcient to switch between states blocking and permitting ion passage, respectively.
Proton Conduction The quasi-1D hydrogen-bonded wires of water molecules formed inside narrow CNTs are excellent conductors of protons. Simulations on quantum-mechanical energy surfaces from density-functional theory and empirical-valence bond approaches showed that the proton mobility along those wires exceeds that in bulk water by more than an order of magnitude (36–39). These results are consistent with earlier classical studies (122).
In the quasi-1D system, the conduction of an excess proton is well described by Grotthuss-type (123) diffusion of a charge defect (36, 37). In a 1D chain, the motion of the defect requires only relatively small and local rearrangements (Supplemental Figure 1, top panel; follow the Supplemental Material link from the Annual Reviews home page at http://www.annualreviews.org). In contrast, proton motion in bulk water is strongly coupled to orientational changes in the second solvation shell (124) and beyond (125, 126), making it effectively slower (Supplemental Figure 1, bottom panel).
To complete the proton transfer along a 1D water chain in a nanopore, the dipole orientation of the water molecules has to revert back to its original direction (122). That second step transfers approximately 40% of the effective charge, on top of the

60% associated with the motion of the charge defect (36). Simulations show that the dipole ﬂip is fast, occurring through the diffusive motion of a hydrogen-bonding defect (127, 128), and does not limit the overall proton transfer rate (36).
High conductivity requires not only fast charge mobility but also a large charge concentration. For CNT membranes in contact with bulk water, simulations suggest that the desolvation penalty for protons is large (36). The concentration of protons in the pores thus remains low, reminiscent of charge exclusion in biological water pores (107–111). The current density estimated from simulations (36) is approximately two orders of magnitude below that of polymer electrolyte membranes. However, one may use the proton concentration’s sensitivity to the interaction energy to reach the currents required in fuel cells, taking advantage of the low electro-osmotic drag (36).
Methane/Solute Transport Researchers have extensively studied the transport of methane and other gases through CNTs (129). Here we focus on molecular ﬂows in condensed liquid phases. The uniformly nonpolar interior space of CNTs can accommodate not only water but also other molecular solutes dissolved in the aqueous phase.
In simulations of a CNT in methane-water solutions, methanes sampled the space vicinal to the CNT rim, breaking the single-ﬁle hydrogen-bonded water wire over nanosecond timescales and partitioning into the tube (33). Other methanes rapidly followed and ﬁlled the tube over subnanosecond timescales. Preliminary studies of CNTs with larger interior diameters, and with other test solutes (e.g., octane, methanol), also showed selective partitioning.
As shown elsewhere (33), the partitioning of nonpolar solutes into CNTs is highly favorable. As a result, once a CNT is ﬁlled with methanes, water molecules rarely enter the tube, whereas methanes from outside do exchange with those inside, by entering through one end and pushing a methane through the other (Figure 1). Several of such concerted events lead to the translocation of a methane molecule through the tube. Thus, the large thermodynamic driving force for ﬁlling leads to highly selective transport. Interestingly, ﬁrst passage time distributions obtained directly from MD simulations, or by ﬁtting a stochastic model to the simulation data, indicate the net rate of methane transport to be ∼11 molecules per nanosecond per CNT for a concentration gradient of 1 mol per liter, exceeding that of water (28).
Studies of methane and water partitioning and transport highlight the underlying principle that selective partitioning leads to selective transport. This is likely relevant to biological channels designed to transport low-concentration solutes across physical barriers, such as membranes. For example, both glycerol (106) and potassium channels (121) have distinct binding sites that help partition their substrate as a prerequisite to transport.
Nucleic Acids and Peptides With their weakly polar character, CNTs in water interact strongly not only with dissolved nonpolar molecules such as methane (33), but also with molecules with

amphiphilic character such as nucleic acids (34) and peptides (130). Simulations showed that under the inﬂuence of electric ﬁelds, small single-stranded RNA molecules passed through CNT membranes with pore diameters of ∼1.4 nm. Differences in the amino acid sequence of the RNA affected the translocation rate through steric effects and the strength of hydrophobic interactions. After multiple translocations through a series of membranes, those differences led to the gradual separation of RNA molecules with different base sequences (34), suggesting possible applications in nanoscale molecular separation. Covalent modiﬁcations (131, 132) of the CNTs should further enhance the speciﬁcity of such devices.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS The work reviewed here is intended in part to provide a framework for thinking about thermodynamic, structural, and kinetic aspects of water under various nanoscopic conﬁnements, as well as molecular partitioning and transport of water and solutes through microscopic channels. It reﬂects on an exciting area of research of ﬂuids properties and transport at the small-systems level (133). The speciﬁc examples highlight nanoscopic systems as distinct from homogeneous bulk systems, and point to potential technological applications beyond the obvious academic interest.
The shape of the cavity space inside CNTs or fullerenes and the uniform graphitic chemistry with its remarkable molecular smoothness (in the absence of defects) have important consequences on the thermodynamic and structural properties of ﬂuids, especially water, that ﬁll them. The enthalpy of water transfer into the pore typically dominates the free energy of transfer, indicating the importance of water-water hydrogen bonds and water-cavity van der Waals interactions (22, 42). As a consequence, a rich variety of water structures emerge, ranging from single-ﬁle hydrogenbonded wires in CNTs with small diameters (21) over various N body clusters inside fullerenes (22) to several new phases of quasi-1D ice in CNTs of diameters in the range of 1–1.5 nm (86, 89). In most cases, the observed structures are unique to nanoscopic systems and difﬁcult or impossible to stabilize in the absence of conﬁnement. Nanoscopic conﬁnement also affects thermodynamic properties and phase behavior. The presence of a solid-liquid critical point for ice-water systems inside CNTs (86), a shift to lower temperatures in the anomalous thermodynamic properties of water in slit-pore geometries (134, 135), and the formation of bilayer ice between hydrophobic plates (92) are a few representative examples.
Studies of nanoscopically conﬁned water have already led to new insights into the molecular function of proteins (35, 43). The fast ﬂow of water through CNTs (21, 28, 29) captures important aspects of the ﬂow through aquaporins (107, 108). Drying and wetting of protein channels have been suggested as factors in channel gating (46, 136, 137). Changes in the redox or protonation state, or the structure of the protein, can control such drying. The transient uptake of water molecules, triggered by changes in the local structure and charge states in cytochrome P450 (24, 25) and bacteriorhodopsin (138, 139), is thought to mediate proton transfer. Indeed, simulations for model systems showed remarkably fast proton transfer rates along single-ﬁle chains of water (36–39, 122). These fast rates, combined with the collective

dipolar orientation of the water wires, may be central to the function of cytochrome c oxidase, the proton pump powering aerobic life (140). The unidirectional transfer of protons along the water wire, with its orientation controlled by the redox state of the enzyme through electric ﬁelds (42), suggests that water molecules act as a diode for proton-transfer reactions.
Properties of molecular ﬂows differ signiﬁcantly from those of macroscopic hydrodynamic ﬂows. Even in an osmotically driven ﬂow that follows the gradient in free energy, instantaneous ﬂow is stochastic in nature and can be described well by a 1D continuous-time random-walk model (28). The smooth hydrophobic walls of the CNT offer little hydrodynamic friction, and surprisingly high ﬂow rates can be achieved, indicating signiﬁcant slip at the wall (30, 31, 116, 117). How the stochastic nature of the ﬂow is coarse grained with increasing tube diameter to eventually overlap with continuum hydrodynamics expectations is not entirely understood and presents an interesting direction for future research.
The simulation work described here focuses on the partitioning of water (and other molecules) into simple model nanoscopic systems of different shapes—cylindrical, spherical, and slit-pore-like. These geometries already have parallels in biomolecular systems that self-assemble and perform speciﬁc functions (43, 104, 105). With the advent of experimental methods of CNT synthesis (141, 142) and functionalization (131, 132, 143), and an improved understanding of micro- and nanoﬂuidics (144), it is not difﬁcult to imagine the development of nanoﬂuidic networks to transport small quantities of ﬂuid molecules from one location to another, mimicking at the smallest scale the network of pumps, pipes, and valves used in our everyday world to transport ﬂuids. Fundamentally interesting results on ﬁlling/emptying binary transitions in CNTs (21) suggest that gating or control of ﬂuid ﬂow may be possible via several strategies, including altering the difference in the chemical potential of water inside and outside the tube. The possibility of the functionalization of CNT rims using short polymers or peptides (131, 132) may allow one to design molecular valves (145) that are selective to certain molecules and open or close in response to external stimuli, such as pH, salt or osmolyte concentration, hydrostatic pressure, and light. Simulations of ﬂuid ﬂow through a Y-junction CNT (146) have been reported. Junctions of CNTs have been made experimentally (147) by welding CNTs together (148). If the internal pores of Y- or T-shaped tubes can indeed be connected, such tubes would form ideal components in nanoﬂuidic networks. Osmotic pumping of water through CNT membranes (28) or a ﬂuid propeller made from a functionalized CNT (149) or electro-osmotic ﬂow (32) may serve to drive ﬂuid motion in such networks.
Simulations and recent experimental results demonstrating unexpectedly fast ﬂow of water and other liquids through membranes containing CNTs (30, 31, 116, 117) suggest potential applications in a number of areas, including desalination, water puriﬁcation, and molecular separations. Of course, numerous technological and fundamental hurdles need to be overcome before such applications truly can be realized. Technological hurdles revolve around the ability to synthesize nanoscopic components with precision and reproducibility, the chemical functionalization of the components, and the creation of such designs on a relatively large scale in an affordable manner.

SUMMARY POINTS 1. Water can ﬁll nonpolar pores and cavities of nanoscopic dimensions, such
as those in nanotubes and proteins, but the ﬁlling is highly sensitive to the effective pore polarity and solvent thermodynamic conditions. 2. Nonpolar pores form excellent low-friction conduits for the ﬂow of water. 3. Protons move with high mobility along 1D water wires that form inside narrow CNTs. 4. Nonpolar cavities, including open-cage fullerenes, provide a means to study small and otherwise unstable hydrogen-bonded water clusters. 5. Proteins appear to exploit the unusual properties of conﬁned water—e.g., the sensitivity of drying transitions to the effective polarity or fast proton transfer along 1D water wires—in their biological function. 6. The partitioning of water and other solutes into nanotubes and the lowfriction ﬂow through nanotubes open the possibility of designing nanoﬂuidic devices in the future.
