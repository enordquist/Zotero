The dewetting transitions of two hydrophobic plates immersed in pure water, aqueous ethanol solutions with concentrations from 25% to 90%, and pure ethanol were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations, where the dewetting transition was analogous to a ﬁrst-order phase transition from liquid to vapor. It was found that the dewetting transitions occurred except that in the pure ethanol system. Although the ethanol molecules prefer to locate in the vicinity of the two plates, the inter-plate region is unfavorable for water molecules, due to losing more than one hydrogen bond. Moreover, each inter-plate water molecule forms hydrogen bonds on average with about two ethanol molecules. These intermolecular hydrogen bonds cause water and ethanol to cooperatively ﬁll or exit the inter-plate region. Thus, water molecules play a more important role in the interplate ﬁlling/empty process, and induce the ethanol dewetting transition. Our results provide insight into the effect of water on the ethanol dewetting phenomena. © 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4733719]

I. INTRODUCTION
Hydrophobic interactions play an important role in many physico-chemical processes,1–5 such as protein folding,6 micelle formation,1,7 water permeation in membrane channels,8,9 and separation of hydrophobic particles.10–12 When two nanoscale plates are extremely hydrophobic, there is a so-called dewetting transition in-between the two nanoseparated plates,13–15 i.e., when two hydrophobic plates (THPs) approach each other and reach a critical distance, which may still be large enough to accommodate several layers of water molecules, water molecules trapped between the plates spontaneously evaporate before the collapse of the plates. A macroscopic theory predicts that the dewetting critical distance is proportional to −cosθ C, θ C is the water contact angle and DC is the critical distance deﬁned for dewetting below which vapor is the stable phase (for dewetting to happen, the contact angle needs to be larger than 90◦). It is shown that this macroscopic theory also applies well on the nanoscale for aqueous solutions.13, 15–17
It has been shown that the presence of small solute molecules, such as denaturants, structure protectants, and alcohols, may greatly affect the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction in aqueous solutions, and thus should inﬂuence the thermal stability and/or solubility of proteins.18–20 However, the microscopic mechanism of how cosolvent molecules affect hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions is a fundamental question in the protein chemistry ﬁeld, and remains a matter of some controversy.21–23 Examining the impact of these solutes on the dewetting phenomenon could provide a new perspective.23

As a short-chain alcohol and very common small organic compound, ethanol has been found to display many different roles in both scientiﬁc and technological ﬁelds.24–26 Despite the above signiﬁcant roles of ethanol molecules in these nanoconﬁned pores or cavities, little is known experimentally about their molecular-scale behavior within those nanopores/nanocavities. There have been some theoretical studies, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, focusing on the effects of hydrogen bonding on the structures of alcohol/water mixtures, and the wetting of water and water/ethanol droplets on a nonpolar surface.27–32 However, knowledge of the inﬂuence of ethanol molecules on the hydrophobic effect, particularly on the dewetting transition between two hydrophobic nanoscale plates, is still incomplete, even though much study has been given to water molecules conﬁned to nonpolar nanopores/nanocavities.16,33–36 Since ethanol is a small amphiphilic molecule, one may expect that the existence of ethanol molecules will degrade the dewetting behavior.
In this article, to focus on the dewetting transition process, we employed MD simulations of THPs immersed in pure water, aqueous ethanol solutions with ethanol mass fractions from 25% to 90%, and pure ethanol. It was found that no dewetting transition was observed in pure ethanol, but dewetting transitions occurred in pure water and the aqueous ethanol solutions. We further found the critical dewetting distance to be nearly constant (1.10–1.20 nm). Ethanol molecules prefer to locate in the vicinity of the THPs, and the energy analyses indicate that ethanol molecules favorably aggregate in the inter-plate region. However, the interplate region is unfavorable for water molecules, due to losing more than one hydrogen bond (HB). Moreover, each interplate water molecule forms HBs on average with about two ethanol molecules. These intermolecular HBs between water and ethanol molecules cause that water and ethanol to

cooperatively ﬁll or exit the inter-plate region. Thus, water molecules play a more important role in inter-plate ﬁlling/empty process, and induce the ethanol dewetting transition.
The structure of this article was as follows. In Sec. II, the methodology of the MD simulation details are introduced. In Sec. III, the main results of the analysis are present, including inter-plate molecular number, number density proﬁles, average van der Waals (vdW) interaction and average number of HBs, time traces and correlation coefﬁcients, and critical distance with ethanol concentration. In Sec. IV, we make the ﬁnal remarks.
II. SIMULATION METHOD
The THPs are the same as the model hydrophobic plates used in the previous work of Berne et al.37 The two plates were parallel to each other. Each plate was modeled as a single-layer of 49 neutral Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles, arranged in a square lattice with a bond length of 0.32 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(a) drawn by the molecular visualization program VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics).38 The LJ diameter and well depth of each LJ particle were σ p = 0.40 nm and εp = 0.5 kJ/mol (values were chosen to maintain a water droplet contact angle greater than 90◦), respectively. Thus, the size of each plate is 2.32 × 2.32 nm2. The two plates were constrained with a harmonic potential with a force constant of 9000 kJ mol−1 Å−2 at speciﬁed plate separations from 0.7 to 1.5 nm with an interval of 0.05 nm. The cubic periodic simulation boxes have side lengths of ∼5 nm. Parameters for ethanol molecules were taken from the all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations force ﬁeld.39 The rigid extended simple point charge potential SPC/E was used for water,40 and the SETTLE algorithm was used to keep the O−H distance ﬁxed at 1 Å and the H−O−H angle at 109.47◦.41
The GROMACS (Ref. 42) MD package was used for all simulations with a time step of 1 fs. Geometric combining rules were applied to calculate the LJ interactions between different particles: εij = (εiiεjj)1/2 and σ ij = (σ iiσ jj)1/2, where εii and σ ii were the parameters of atom i for the LJ diameter and well depth, respectively. Eight solution systems with ethanol mass fractions of 0%, 25%, 40%, 54%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% were simulated (see Table I). These eight so-

lutions were initially equilibrated at a constant pressure and temperature (NPT) of 1 bar and 298 K for 5 ns, and then two plates were added to the simulation boxes (see Fig. 1(b)). 15-ns NPT simulations were carried out after the energy minimization with a steepest-descent algorithm. We allowed the ﬁrst 5-ns data for system equilibration, and the subsequent 10-ns were used for data collection. The NPT ensemble was maintained at a constant 298 K temperature using the NoséHoover thermostat43 and 1 bar pressure using the ParrinelloRahman barostat.44 The Particle-Mesh Ewald method45 was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions, and vdW interactions were treated with a cutoff distance of 1.20 nm. 25-ns simulations were extended for data collection near the critical dewetting distance, because the systems vacillated between the liquid phase and vapor phase, needing more data for statistics.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Inter-plate atom number
Figure 2 shows the numbers of water and ethanol molecules located in the inter-plate region as a function of the plate separation for four typical systems (pure water, 25% ethanol, 54% ethanol, and pure ethanol). For the pure water system, there is a sharp decrease from 1.2 to 1.15 nm in the number of inter-plate water molecules, indicating a dewetting transition caused by increased liquid-phase conﬁnement (see Fig. 2(a)). This is consistent with previous results.13,15,16 Water molecules readily permeate the inter-plate region and form a dense liquid when the plate separations D ≥ 1.20 nm. For the pure ethanol system (Fig. 2(b)), ethanol molecules could ﬁll the inter-plate region at D ≥ 0.8 nm. We note that ethanol molecules are expelled from the inter-plate region at D = 0.7 or 0.75 nm, which seems the dewetting behavior. However, the expulsion of ethanol at small plate separations should be attributed to the fact that the effective distance of the two plates, (D − σ p) = 0.30 or 0.35 nm, is geometrically too small to accommodate even a single ethanol molecular layer (∼0.40 nm), rather than the hydrophobic effect. Thus, for the pure ethanol system, there is no evidence for a dewetting transition as was seen in pure water.
There are two large decreases in Fig. 2(b): from 1.25 to 1.15 nm for the 25% ethanol system and from 1.15 to 1.1 nm for the 54% ethanol system. These decreases demonstrate that the dewetting transitions occur for both the 25% and 54% ethanol systems. We also observe that the inter-plate

FIG. 2. (a) The number of inter-plate water molecules as a function of the plate separation for the pure water system (open black squares), 25% (open red circles), and 54% (open blue triangles) ethanol systems. (b) The number of inter-plate ethanol molecules as a function of plate separation for the pure (solid black squares), 25% (solid red circles), and 54% (solid blue triangles) ethanol systems.

ethanol numbers for both the 25% and 54% ethanol systems are less than that for the pure ethanol system at 0.8 ≤ D < 1.15 nm. This suggests that ethanol ﬁlling is inhibited compared with the pure ethanol system at D < 1.15 nm. Comparing Fig. 2(a) with Fig. 2(b), it can be seen that the number of inter-plate ethanol molecules is much larger than the number of inter-plate water molecules at 0.8 ≤ D ≤ 1.15 nm for both the 54% and 25% ethanol systems, indicating that ethanol molecules dominate in ﬁlling the interplate region. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the water molecules almost disappear in the inter-plate region when D < 1.15 nm, and the number of water molecules gradually increases when D ≥ 1.15 nm.
Lundgren et al. found that the contact angle decreased when ethanol molecules were present in water droplets on a non-polar surface,32 implying a decrease of the critical dewetting distance from the theory that DC ∝ cosθ C (Refs. 15 and 16) (θ C > 90◦) or the disappearance of the dewetting transition (θ C < 90◦). However, we note that the critical dewetting distance (DC ≈ 1.15 nm) for the 54% ethanol system is nearly the same as that for the pure water system (DC ≈ 1.20 nm). These results indicate that the mixture of ethanol and water has little impact on the critical distance for dewetting, which is in conﬂict with the conventional theory.
B. Number density proﬁles
In order to understand the dewetting phenomenon in aqueous ethanol solutions, we have taken the 54% ethanol system as a typical example for further analyses. We have ﬁrst calculated number density proﬁles in directions perpendicular (along the z-axis) and parallel to the plates (x-y plane), as shown in Figs. 3(a), 3(c), 3(b), and 3(d), respectively, of the location of the ethanol ethyl (−C2H5), the ethanol hydroxyl group (−OH), and water. Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) correspond to number density proﬁles with plate separations of D = 1.30 nm > DC ≈ 1.15 nm, and Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) correspond to that with D = 0.90 nm < DC ≈ 1.15 nm.
Each of the number density proﬁles in Fig. 3 display obvious −OH and –C2H5 peaks near the plates, which clearly show that ethanol molecules preferentially locate in the vicinity of the two plates. In contrast, the peaks of water molecule density near the plates are much less obvious than that of ethanol. Therefore, the ethanol molecules are more easily

FIG. 3. Number density proﬁles for the ethanol −C2H5, ethanol −OH, and water for the 54% ethanol system with D = 1.30 nm (a, b) and D = 0.90 nm (c, d). The densities of the −C2H5 and −OH are independently calculated, irrespective of whether they belong to one same ethanol molecule or not. (a) and (c) display the number densities in the z-axis direction with the counted area in the x-y plane same as the region of the THPs; (b) and (d) display the number densities in the x- and y-axis directions in the inter-plate region with the counted area in the y-z plane and the x-z plane same as the region in-between the plates, respectively. The vertical cyan dashed lines indicate the position of the plates in (a) and (c).
to be adsorbed on the plates than water molecules. Particularly, in Figs. 3(a), 3(c), and 3(d), the slight offsets between the two corresponding ethanol –OH and –C2H5 peaks show that there are preferred orientations with the −C2H5 groups pointing toward, and the −OH groups pointing away from, the two plates. These observations are consistent with previous work.32,46 We also observe that the number of inter-plate −C2H5 groups was greater than the number −OH groups, which further veriﬁes that the ethanol molecules prefer orientations with their −C2H5 groups pointing toward and −OH groups pointing away from the plates.
In Fig. 3(a) (D = 1.30 nm), there are two separate peaks in the inter-plate region for both −C2H5 and −OH, showing the presence of two ethanol molecular layers. Interestingly, the two −OH peaks are very close, indicating that the spreading ethanol molecules orient with their −OH groups head to head. In Fig. 3(b), there are no preferred orientations in the x- and y-axis directions because both ethanol and water molecules fully permeate the inter-plate region. In Fig. 3(c) (D = 0.90 nm), there is only one peak for both −C2H5 and −OH in the inter-plate region. At this decreased distance, the inter-plate region is only able to accommodate one ethanol molecular layer. Additionally all the three inter-plate number densities of −C2H5, −OH, and water in Fig. 3(c) are substantially lower than that in Fig. 3(a). This difference indicates that for D = 0.90 nm, there is a vapor state in the inter-plate region, while the liquid state is dominant when D = 1.30 nm.
C. Average vdW interactions and average number of HBs
The analyses above show that ethanol molecules are more easily to locate in the vicinity of the THPs than water. Thus, ethanol molecules may prefer to ﬁll the inter-plate region, and

FIG. 4. (a) Average vdW interaction of water and ethanol molecules with the THPs and (b) average number of HBs per water or ethanol as a function of the plate separation in the inter-plate region. The black squares represent water in pure water; the red circles and blue triangles, ethanol and water for the 54% ethanol system, respectively; the cyan triangles, ethanol in pure ethanol. (c) Average number of HBs for the 54% ethanol system: ethanol-ethanol per ethanol (red squares), ethanol-water per ethanol (red triangles), ethanol-water per water (blue triangles), and water-water per water (blue squares).
then the dewetting transition for aqueous ethanol solutions should not occur. Therefore, the question arises: what causes the dewetting transitions for aqueous ethanol solutions?
It is known that the loss of HBs for water molecules between two extended hydrophobic surfaces causes the water to move away from the surfaces, producing thin vapor layers and resulting in the dewetting transition,13 while the vdW interaction energy between water and the two surfaces could only compensate for a fraction energy of the lost HBs. We calculated the average water-plate and ethanol-plate vdW interactions, and the average number of HBs per water and ethanol molecule in the inter-plate region for the pure water, the 54% ethanol, and pure ethanol systems (Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)). Here, we have used a geometrical deﬁnition of the HB where oxygen-oxygen distances, r(O. . . O) ≤ 3.5 Å, and HB angles O. . . O−H ≤ 30◦ were used to count HBs.47,48 We also assumed that the average energy per HB was 20.41 kJ/mol.49
For the pure ethanol system, the average number of the HBs per ethanol molecule is 1.8 in bulk, consistent with previous simulations.46,50 The loss of HBs for ethanol molecules only exists at D < 1.15 nm (Fig. 4(b)), where the ethanolplate vdW interaction energy (> 7 kJ/mol in Fig. 4(a)) is

larger than the energy (<0.22 HBs ≈ 4.5 kJ/mol) induced by the lost HBs. Therefore, ethanol molecules preferentially locate on the THPs and easily ﬁll the inter-plate region, which conﬁrms the previous density proﬁles of ethanol molecules in Fig. 3. This result also helps to explain why the dewetting transition induced by the hydrophobic effect does not occur in pure ethanol. For the pure water system, the average number of the HBs per water molecule is 3.60 in bulk. The interplate water molecules lose more than 1 HB (> 20.41 kJ/mol) at D < 1.20 nm; whereas the average water-plate vdW interaction energy is less than 3 kJ/mol (Fig. 4(a)). This vdW interaction energy cannot compensate for the loss of the HBs. This rough analysis suggests that water molecules are expelled away from the inter-plate region, resulting in the occurrence of the dewetting transition at D < 1.20 nm.
For the 54% ethanol system, the average numbers of HBs per ethanol and water are 2.22 and 3.40 in the bulk solution, respectively. Comparing the loss of the HBs (<4.5 kJ/mol, Fig. 4(b)) with the corresponding compensated vdW energy with the THPs (> 7 kJ/mol, Fig. 4(a)) for each ethanol molecule, we deduce that it is energetically favorable for ethanol molecules to aggregate in the inter-plate region at D < 1.15 nm, but that water molecules cannot stably locate in the inter-plate region at D < 1.20 nm because the loss of the HBs (> 20.41 kJ/mol, Fig. 4(b)) is not compensated by the vdW energy (<3 kJ/mol, Fig. 4(a)). Here, it should be pointed out that even though there are very few water molecules between the THPs, the dewetting transitions for aqueous ethanol solutions still occur. From the above energy analyses, we conclude that the energetic penalty due to the loss of HBs when water molecules enter the inter-plate region should be responsible for the dewetting transitions.
In Fig. 4(c), we ﬁnd that ethanol molecules for the 54% ethanol system initially prefer to form HBs with themselves at D ≤ 1.15 nm. With the plate separation increasing, the average number of ethanol-ethanol HBs decreases, and both ethanol-water and water-water HBs increase, due to an increase in the number of inter-plate water molecules (see Fig. 2(a)). Note that each water molecule forms ∼2 waterethanol HBs at each plate separation, i.e., nearly every water molecule forms HBs with two ethanol molecules.
D. Time traces and Spearman Rank correlation coefﬁcients
To obtain more details, we further investigated the process of the dewetting transition. In Fig. 5(a), we have shown the time traces of the inter-plate molecular numbers for the pure ethanol system and the 54% ethanol system at D = 0.90 nm. For the pure ethanol system, one ethanol layer (∼20 molecules) can readily ﬁll the region between the plates and the liquid phase is very stable. For the 54% ethanol system, the inter-plate region vacillates between vapor phase and liquid phase with the molecular number ranging from 0 to 28; obvious dewetting transitions exist between the THPs, and the vapor phase is dominant between the THPs, because the average molecular number is only about 12.
We found that there is a cooperative effect between ethanol and water molecules when they enter or exit the

(b) Time traces of the number of inter-plate ethanol (left black axis) and water (right red axis) molecules for the 54% ethanol system at D = 0.90 nm.

inter-plate region (see Fig. 5(b)). This cooperative effect can be described by the Spearman Rank correlation coefﬁcient,51–53 ρ, between the molecular numbers of ethanol and water in the inter-plate region. In statistics, the correlation coefﬁcient, ρ, indicates how well the relationship between X (the independent variable) and Y (the dependent variable) can be described using a monotonic function, and has a value within the range of +1.00 and −1.00. The sign of ρ indicates the direction of association between two variables. Using the 35 ns simulation data, we obtained ρ ≈ 0.3 for the two unsmoothed time traces, and ρ ≈ 0.51 for the two time traces smoothed by a 1 GHz low pass ﬁlter (Fig. 5(b)). Considering the few water molecules and the large ﬂuctuations in the numbers of inter-plate ethanol and water molecules, values of 0.3 and 0.51 suggest that the ﬁlling process of ethanol and water exhibits a cooperative effect.
The Spearman Rank correlation coefﬁcients of the two unsmoothed time traces of ethanol and water for the 54% ethanol system were also calculated as a function of plate separation in Fig. 6. ρ > 0 at D < 1.15 nm, which suggests that the ﬁlling process of ethanol and water exhibits a cooperative effect when the vapor phase is dominant. Once D ≥ 1.15 nm, ρ < 0, which shows a competition effect between ethanol and water due to the ﬁnite volume between the THPs when the liquid phase is dominant.
As mentioned above, water prefers to form HBs with ethanol, and nearly each water molecule could form HBs with two ethanol molecules. Note that, each water molecule in the inter-plate region at D ≤ 1.15 nm on average loses more than

one HB compared with bulk water molecules. Thus, water molecules cannot stably locate between the THPs and are expelled away, taking ethanol molecules out of the inter-plate region. Therefore, the inter-plate region displays a vapor state. Thus, the cooperative effect can be attributed to the inﬂuence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between ethanol and water molecules.
E. Critical distance with ethanol concentration
The relationship between the critical dewetting distance and the ethanol concentration is shown in Fig. 7. The critical distance varies between 1.20 nm and 1.10 nm when the ethanol mass fraction varies from 25% to 90%. This result shows that the water-induced ethanol dewetting transition in our simulated systems exists and the critical distance keeps almost constant over an extensive range of ethanol concentrations. Therefore, the inhibition effect of ethanol ﬁlling in aqueous ethanol solutions is almost independent of the ethanol concentrations. At the same time, we have also found that the average number of inter-plate water molecules slowly decreases with increasing ethanol concentration, e.g., from 2.3 to 0.9 at D = 1.0 nm (see the inset in Fig. 7). This suggests that the amount of inter-plate water molecules has some impact on the critical distance. In summary, the critical distance slightly decreases with the ethanol concentration.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
To summarize, we have systematically studied the dewetting transition in pure water, aqueous ethanol solutions with ethanol mass fractions from 25% to 90%, and pure ethanol. Our results showed that the dewetting transition occurred when the hydrophobic plates were immersed in the pure water and aqueous ethanol solutions. Moreover, no dewetting transition was observed in pure ethanol. It should be pointed that water molecules play a key role in the dewetting transition, though ethanol molecules prefer to locate in the vicinity of the THPs. Trapped between the THPs, each water molecule could not steadily stay in the inter-plate region, due to large HB loss and little water-plate vdW interaction compensation. We also found that each inter-plate water molecule forms HBs

on average with about two ethanol molecules. From the time traces and the Spearman Rank correlation coefﬁcients, we concluded that water and ethanol ﬁll or exit the inter-plate region in cooperativity, which is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between water and ethanol molecules. In addition, we ﬁnd that the critical distance for dewetting in aqueous ethanol solutions keeps nearly constant with ethanol concentration varying from 25% to 90% in our systems. The results of our simulations may challenge the theory that DC ∝ −cosθ C, which is widely used in predicting the critical distance for dewetting in pure water. It is expected that our ﬁndings will help to expand the knowledge of cosolvent effects on dewetting.
