Urea has been widely used as a protein denaturant for more than a hundred years; however, its chemical denaturation mechanism still remains controversial, despite the extensive
studies from both experimental and theoretical approaches in last several decades.1-19 The denaturing power of urea has been explained by two very diﬀerent mechanisms: the “indirect” and “direct” mechanisms. The indirect mechanism suggests that urea
denatures proteins by disrupting the water structure, which in
turn weakens the hydrophobic interaction and makes the protein hydrophobic residues less compact and more readily solvated.4
The direct mechanism, on the other hand, indicates that urea
unfolds proteins through direct interactions with protein, either through stronger electrostatic interactions10,11,13,16 with back-
bone and/or polar residues or through preferential van der Waals attractions14,15,18 with protein residues. Most of the concurrent studies support the direct mechanism involving urea’s preferential binding to protein backbone or side chains,10,11,13-15,18
although some recent studies also indicate that the indirect mech-
anism can also play a role in the urea-induced protein denaturation.8,16,19
In a previous paper, Das and Mukhopadhyay, proposed a consensus view of the urea-induced protein denaturing mechanism.16 In particular, Das et al. found that urea preferen-
tially binds to ubiquitin through its stronger electrostatic inter-
actions with protein than water, and more surprisingly, they
found that when a urea molecule moves from the bulk to the
protein ubiquitin surface, it experiences more favorable electro-
static energy with the surrounding environment by an astounding ∼-13 kcal/mol. This contradicts our earlier ﬁndings on the protein lysozyme,14,21 where we found that urea denatures the
protein through its stronger van der Waals attractions to protein than does water, with about a -2 kcal/mol change in vdW energy when moving from the bulk to the lysozyme surface (versus ∼0 kcal/mol for water).14 Das et al. proposed that the diﬀerence in mechanism might arise because these are diﬀerent proteins; i.e., the results might be protein speciﬁc. After a careful evaluation, we believe that the diﬀerences are not from the diﬀerent proteins
used (see below for more data) and cannot be fully explained with the diﬀerent cutoﬀs and temperatures used in both studies.
The disagreement between Das et al.’s results and ours can best be seen in the large diﬀerence in the water electrostatic interaction energy for both the bulk and protein ﬁrst solvation shell (FSS). In Figure 1, we reproduce these energy distribution proﬁles for water. The electrostatic interaction energy for each water molecule with the rest of the system is about -20 kcal/mol

in our calculations (with similar values for both the bulk and FSS), while in Das et al.’s paper it is only about -1 kcal/mol. This large a diﬀerence (∼19 kcal/mol) in bulk water electrostatic
interaction energies is clearly beyond normal statistical variance,
it is also inconsistent with hydrogen bond strengths. One might argue that the FSS data could be somewhat diﬀerent for diﬀerent protein systems (ours is lysozyme, and Das et al.’s is ubiquitin),
but the bulk data should be the same since we are using the same force ﬁeld for water (the CHARMM version of the TIP3P water model20) under similar temperatures. Considering that the water conﬁguration energy is about -10 kcal/mol in TIP3P (all other water models give roughly the same value for this conﬁguration energy),20 and van der Waals energies do not contribute much to the conﬁguration energy (roughly 0-1 kcal/mol in both calcula-
tions; see Table 1 below for more details), the pairwise water electrostatic interaction energy should be approximately -20
kcal/mol (the average pairwise interaction energy needs to be divided by 2 to get the average conﬁguration energy, since it is
shared by both parties). It is important to note that most of the diﬀerences between their and our simulations come from the contribution of the bulk data to the diﬀerence in energy of either water or urea in the ﬁrst solvation shell of the protein from that in the bulk urea-water solution (ΔE = EFSS - EBulk).
We have considered that one possible reason for the discrepancy could be the diﬀerent cutoﬀs used, since electrostatic
interactions are long-range interactions. It seems Das et al. had been using a 9 Å cutoﬀ for their pairwise electrostatic interaction
energy analysis (personal communication; their simulation was run with PME16), while we used an 80 Å cutoﬀ (essentially no cutoﬀ).21 To see if this could explain the observed diﬀerence, we
addressed this problem by performing four independent calculations, with three diﬀerent codes, to calculate the electrostatic interaction energies at diﬀerent cutoﬀs for both the pure 8 M urea
solution and lysozyme in 8 M urea. Table 1 lists the interaction energies with cutoﬀs of 8, 10, 12, 20, and 80 Å (i.e., for essentially no cutoﬀ so as to be consistent with the PME simulations used). As one can see, with diﬀerent cutoﬀs, there can be a 2-3 kcal/ mol diﬀerence in the electrostatic interactions for the bulk water, and a 3-4 kcal/mol diﬀerence for the bulk urea. But these are deﬁnitely not in the range of the ∼19 kcal/mol diﬀerence between our result and Das et al.’s for bulk water! So there must be something else in play. The diﬀerences in the bulk urea

electrostatic interaction energy in lysozyme in 8 M urea are somewhat larger with various cutoﬀs (up to 7 kcal/mol), which indicates that too small a cutoﬀ might be troublesome. Once a cutoﬀ of 20 Å or above is used for the electrostatics, however, the
results are largely converged. The van der Waals interactions are less sensitive to the cutoﬀs, as one would expect (we used 80 Å in
analysis as well, and Das et al used 7 Å). Ubiquitin in 8 M urea
shows similar results (more below). Therefore, we think the diﬀerent cutoﬀs used might have contributed to some of the diﬀerences, but not all.
To see if these results are unique to the speciﬁc proteins, we repeated our calculations for ﬁve diﬀerent protein systems in 8 M urea, lysozyme, ubiquitin, human γD-drystallin, CI2, and a tetramer of a small Aβ-peptide fragment (NFGAIL), and found similar interaction energy proﬁles for all of them (data not shown).
A quick analysis of the charged residue distributions of each
protein shows that they share similar charged residue distribu-
tions (see Table 2), suggesting that one should not expect large

diﬀerences in electrostatic interaction energy proﬁles among these proteins. Thus presumed diﬀerences in charge distributions of diﬀerent proteins probably cannot explain the discrepancies.
Finally, we repeated molecular dynamics simulations on the Das et al. protein system ubiquitin, using two diﬀerent solvation
box sizes (see Methods section for more details): one with their
system size and another with a much larger box. We used the various cutoﬀs, 8, 10, 12, 20, up to 80 Å, for the pairwise
interaction energy analysis. Nevertheless, we still could not reproduce their results at any cutoﬀ distance even with their smaller box. Figure 2 shows one representative energy proﬁle of
the urea electrostatic interactions for the smaller box with an 80 Å cutoﬀ and found it to agree reasonably well with our previous
lysozyme data (the agreement is even better for the larger
solvation box). In the current smaller box, the electrostatic
interactions are also slightly more favorable in FSS as compared
to the bulk, but the van der Waals interactions still dominate the interaction energy change, being 2-3 kcal/mol more favorable than the contribution from the electrostatic interactions (ΔΔE = (EFSSvdw - EBulkvdw) - (EFSSelec - EBulkelec)). Again, various cutoﬀs can result in some variance (up to ∼3 kcal/mol) in the diﬀerence between the FSS and bulk urea electrostatic interactions, but deﬁnitely not the ∼13 kcal/mol diﬀerence computed
by Das et al. (as shown in Figure 2a). We believe, on the basis of
their water bulk data, as discussed above, that there seems to be some question on how the interaction between diﬀerent parts of the system is computed and reported. The main diﬀerences between the two groups are again in the diﬀerences in the bulk data, where their data diﬀered signiﬁcantly from ours (see Figure 2).

COMMENT

Figure 2. Comparison of the electrostatic energy proﬁles for urea in bulk and FSS for protein ubiquitin. (a) Das et al.16 data; (b) our current data with the same size box as that of Das et al. (the smaller box). Graph (a) reproduced from ref 16 with permission. It should be noted that there are still some slight diﬀerences between the electrostatic interaction energies we computed for urea in ubiquitin with this smaller solvation box and our previous lysozyme data. For the larger solvation box, the agreement of the ubiquitin data with our former lysozyme calculations is much better.

Finally, it should be noted that the solvation box used by Das
et al. seems too small (5 times smaller than our lysozyme box); therefore even if one uses a very large cutoﬀ for the interaction
energy analysis, eventually no additional pairs would be included
in the pair list because one member of the pair would have to
overlap the protein surface. To summarize, we could not reproduce Das et al.’s results
and we believe there might be some question on how the interaction between diﬀerent parts of the system is computed and reported, on top of the too-small cutoﬀs used in the calculation of the pairwise interaction energy proﬁles. Meanwhile, our simulations support a direct mechanism in ureainduced lysozyme unfolding.21 These studies show that urea denaturizes protein though a two-stage kinetic process: ﬁrst by forming a “dry molten globule” and then unfolding with both urea and water exposure. The dry globule has been observed directly by FRET and far-UV CD spectra recently.22 The dominant driving force is through the preferential binding of the protein to urea, with a stronger van der Waals dispersion interaction with urea than water.21 Interestingly, the preferential binding through stronger van der Waals interactions mechanism has now been accepted by researchers who were
previously in the electrostatic interaction camp where the mechanism was believed to be based on urea interacting with the protein through stronger hydrogen bonds.15,21
Methods. The ubiquitin in 8 M urea solution is set up in a similar way to the previous hen lysozyme system, which was reported in detail elsewhere.21,23 The simulation was performed using the NAMD2 molecular dynamics program,24,25 with the all-atom CHARMM force field26 for proteins (lysozyme and
ubiqutin) and solvent urea using PME. A slightly simplified TIP3P water model20 was used for water. Lysozyme was solvated in a 8 M urea box of size 73.1 Å Â 73.1 Å Â 73.1 Å (129 residues, 7799 water molecules, 1811 urea molecules, and 8 Cl- counter-
ions), and ubiquitin in two different sizes of 8 M urea boxes, one the same size as Das et al., 47.1 Å Â 44.7 Å Â 44.9 Å (76 residues,
1739 water molecules, and 438 urea molecules), and the other much larger, 68.5 Å Â 69.4 Å Â 68.1 Å (76 residues, 6722 water
molecules, and 1575 urea molecules). Molecular dynamics simulations of 1000 ns for the lysozyme system and 100þ ns
each for the two ubiquitin systems have been performed for data
collection in this study.
