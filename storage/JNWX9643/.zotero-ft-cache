Summary
As macromolecular crystal structures are determined and refined in an increasingly automated fashion, careful assessment of the reliability and quality of the resulting models becomes increasingly important. Here, we analyze various issues related to the reliability and quality of macromolecular crystal structures deposited between 1991 and 2000. We find that the average resolution at which these structures are determined is essentially constant. In line with this observation, the average quality as measured by Ramachandran analysis does not improve as a function of time. On the other hand, an observed decrease of the average discrepancy between free and conventional R values suggests that the fit of model and data is improving. Finally, we present a surprising correlation between the tendency of crystallographers to deposit their experimental data and the free R values of their models.
Introduction
In the mid-1990s, a series of “angry young men” articles were published in this journal that described the results of an assessment of a number of aspects related to quality control and model validation in protein crystallographic structure determination [1–3]. In the first paper (“Where freedom is given, liberties are taken”) [1], it was shown how contemporary model refinement and publishing practices could lead to the publication of seemingly correct models that are in actual fact completely wrong. The second paper (“Checking your imagination”) [2] was a survey of the use and applications of the free R value and discussed a number of unresolved issues related to the use (and abuse) of the free R value in model refinement. In the third paper (“Phi/psi-chology: Ramachandran revisited”) [3], the usefulness of the Ramachandran plot as a simple yet powerful means of gaining a quick impression of the quality of a protein model was emphasized. On that occasion, a binary division of the Ramachandran-plot area in favorable (or core) and unfavorable regions was also introduced.
Half a decade later, structural biology is rapidly moving into a phase where structures will be determined on an industrial scale, with a reduced level of intervention by human experts. Moreover, structural biologists who determine structures at a conveyer belt will not have

the same affinity (dare we say “love affair”?) with their proteins as the crystallographers who had to toil for years to determine just a single structure. Although increased automation might result in a reduction of human errors during model building, it may equally well lead to an increase of errors if too much faith is put in results obtained with magical black boxes. Although much has happened in the area of protein model validation in the past decade [4], it remains to be seen whether automatic error detection and correction protocols (in particular at low resolution) can rival skilled crystallographers.
At the dawn of the new millennium, we have reinvestigated the use of the free R value and reassessed the quality of protein models as judged by their Ramachandran plots, and looked for trends.
Statistics Using the March 2001 version of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [5, 6], we extracted information regarding the resolution and R values of 10,888 entries that were deposited between 1991 and 2000 and that were determined to a resolution no worse than 4.0 A˚ . Entries for which unresolvable errors or ambiguities in the R-value statistics were encountered were omitted, as were peptide structures containing fewer than 20 amino acid residues (nucleic acid structures were included, however). A total of 10,674 entries remained, and these were subjected to our analyses. For each entry, we recorded the PDB identifier, year of deposition, resolution, conventional R value, free R value, the difference between the free and conventional R value, the number of amino acid residues (for entries containing one or more proteins), and the number and percentage of Ramachandran-plot outliers (using our definition of outliers) [3], although not all of these quantities are necessarily defined for each entry. Table 1 shows an overview of the results obtained as a function of the year of deposition. In the following, we shall refer to a number of so-called “TIE-fighter plots” (also known as “box plots” or “box-whiskers plots”); the meaning of the various markers in such plots is explained in Figure 1.
Resolution Conventional wisdom has it that the average resolution at which macromolecular crystal structures are determined is improving all the time, not in the least due to the use of cryocooling techniques and synchrotron radiation sources. However, both Table 1 and Figure 2 show this assertion to be false—there is essentially no correlation between resolution and year of deposition, and the average resolution for the decade is ‫ف‬2.2 A˚ . Although the average resolution has improved very slightly since 1996, Figure 2 reveals that the 10th and 90th percentiles have been almost constant since 1992. As Table 1 shows (the row marked “ϽResiduesϾ,” i.e., the average number of amino acid residues found in

Various statistics are listed as a function of year of deposition of crystal structures in the PDB. The first five rows pertain to all crystal structures included in this survey. The subsequent set of four rows pertains to all structures for which a free R value could be extracted from the PDB entry. The final set of five rows pertain to all entries that contain one or more protein molecules. Average values are indicated by brackets.

Figure 1. Explanation of the Markers Used in “TIE-Fighter Plots” Rather than showing scatter plots containing more than 10,000 data points (one for each PDB entry in the survey), the data are binned (using the variable along the horizontal axis) and summarized for each bin using a box and several markers. The “whiskers” indicate the 10th and 90th percentile of the data in the bin, whereas the upper and lower boundaries of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentile. The horizontal line inside the box indicates the median (i.e., the 50th percentile), and the crosshair inside the box indicates the average value (in both directions). Finally, in order to show the distribution of the “outliers,” all individual data points outside the whiskers are shown. In addition, for bins containing fewer than ten data points, all points are shown and the box and whiskers are omitted. (Note: Star Wars aficionados will understand why these plots are called “TIE-fighter plots.”)

increased by roughly 40% when comparing the year 1991 (average 385 residues) and the year 2000 (average 549 residues).
R Values Paradoxically, perhaps, the average R value has been increasing since the mid-1990s (Table 1). This is in agreement with our suggestion that many structures were over-fitted in the past, in particular in low-resolution studies and in cases involving the use (and sometimes abuse) of noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) [1, 7, 8], leading to essentially meaningless low R values. Since the average resolution of the structures varies little over time, the increase of the average R values may be due to improved refinement protocols (e.g., restraining NCS, monitoring Rfree) and refinement methodology (in particular, the use of maximum likelihood targets). Nevertheless, the distribution of R values versus resolution still shows an immense “plateau” of structures with R values close to 0.2 (Figure 3). In fact, 92% of all structures have an R value between 0.15 and 0.25.
It is interesting to note how rapidly the use of the free R value has become common practice since 1996. Initially, there were doubts as to the benefits and drawbacks of crossvalidation, but the work of Brunger et al., ourselves, and others (see, for instance, [2, 9–14] as well as the discussion described in [15]) appears to have convinced most crystallographers that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. In the year 2000, 92% of all crystal structure depositions reported a free R value, up from only 33% in 1995.
The average value of the free R value shows a slight tendency to drop with the progression of time (Table 1). We suspect that this too is due to the use of improved methods and, we hope, the adoption of more sensible refinement and rebuilding protocols by a large number of crystallographers.
Crystallographers often wonder what free R values to expect at a certain resolution. Although it doesn’t answer that question, Figure 4 does reveal the distribution of free R values as a function of resolution. At present, only 0.7% of all entries have a free R value of less than

Figure 2. Average Resolution Remains Constant in Time
The average resolution of macromolecular crystal structures does not vary appreciably with time. The linear correlation coefficient of resolution and year of deposition is essentially zero (Ϫ0.04 using all data points; Ϫ0.21 if only the ten bin averages are taken into account).

0.15, and 1.2% have a free R value that exceeds 0.35. However, Figure 4 also shows that there are a number of remarkable outliers.
As one would hope, the free and conventional R values are very strongly correlated (linear correlation coefficient 0.77 if all entries are used, or even 0.99 if the data are binned and only the 17 bin averages are used). A linear fit using all data points yields the following regression

line: Rfree ϭ 1.065 R ϩ 0.036. This implies that for a model with a conventional R value of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3, one would expect to find a free R value of roughly 0.14, 0.25, and 0.36, respectively.
The slow but steady increase of the average R value (as a function of time) and the decrease of the average free R value conspire to reduce the average difference between the free and conventional R value (Figure 5;

Figure 3. The Distribution of R Values versus Resolution

Figure 4. The Distribution of Free R Values versus Resolution

the linear correlation coefficient of the bin averages of this difference and the year of deposition is Ϫ0.97). The discrepancy between conventional and free R values can be attributed to two main factors (apart from noise in the data): incompleteness of the model (in particular, if no maximum likelihood target is used) and over-fitting

(i.e., introducing more parameters in the model than is warranted by the information contained in the data). In other words, decreasing free R values (at roughly constant resolution) and decreasing differences between free and conventional R values both indicate that crystallographers (and their software) are on the whole

doing a better job and producing better models (in terms of their explaining the experimental data).
Ramachandran Analysis As Table 1 shows, the average percentage of Ramachandran-plot outliers (using our definition) [3] is essentially constant as a function of time, indicating that the average overall quality of the protein models that the community produces does not get any better. This may well be related to the observation that the average resolution of the studies has not changed appreciably during the past decade: only improved resolution can result in truly better models and thereby lower the fraction of Ramachandran-plot outliers.
The distribution of the percentage of Ramachandranplot outliers versus resolution (Figure 6) shows that both the average and the 90th percentile are more or less constant up to about 2 A˚ resolution, and increase roughly linearly after that. When we delineated the core and noncore regions of the Ramachandran plot, we found that for structures refined to better than 2 A˚ resolution, we expected to find 0%–5% outliers in the Ramachandran plot. This rule of thumb is still valid today, as demonstrated by Figure 6.
Figure 7 shows the correlation between a statistic that measures the quality of a protein model (percentage of Ramachandran-plot outliers) and one that measures the quality of the fit of the model to the experimental data (free R value). Ideally, both values should be small, so that the bottom left area of this plot contains all the high-quality models. The top right area, on the other hand, probably includes models for which considerations other than protein crystallographic ones have been deemed crucially important in the refereeing process.
Of the 10,215 protein entries surveyed, 78.4% have fewer than 5% outliers in the Ramachandran plot (up from 76.5% in our earlier study) [3], and 6.2% have more

than 10% outliers (down from 8.9%). In this study, the entry with the poorest Ramachandran plot (deposited in 1999) has no fewer than 43.5% outliers.
In this survey, we have calculated the percentage of Ramachandran-plot outliers for each PDB entry as a whole. However, there are cases where this can give misleading results. For example, a complex of botulinum neurotoxin with a target peptide [16] has recently been the source of some controversy [17, 18]. The overall fraction of Ramachandran-plot outliers for the PDB entry of the complex (1F83) is ‫ف‬12%. Although this number is quite high in itself, especially when considering that the data extends to 2.0 A˚ resolution, it would nevertheless not have attracted anyone’s attention in Figure 6, for instance. However, when each chain is analyzed separately, a completely different picture emerges: ‫ف‬71% of the (nonterminal, nonglycine) residues in the peptide (chains B and C) are outliers.
To make it easier to recognize such cases, our webbased Ramachandran servers have been updated to display the results for each chain separately. We have used this facility to investigate how common large variations are in the Ramachandran-plot quality of multiple protein chains that are part of the same crystal structure. We identified 5421 protein crystal structures (deposited between 1991 and 2000, and with a resolution of 4.0 A˚ or better) that contained more than one protein or peptide chain (consisting of at least 10 residues). For each such entry, we calculated the percentage of Ramachandranplot outliers of each individual chain, and from that, the difference between the “worst” (highest percentage outliers) and the “best” chain (data not shown). This analysis revealed that the difference is less than 5% for 87.4% of all entries, and between 5% and 10% for an additional 8.4%. Differences exceeding 30% do occur, but they are rare, accounting for 0.2% of all entries.

Data Deposition In recent years, many journals have imposed (or paid lip service to; J.Y. Zou, M.R. Harris, T. Taylor, A. Wa¨ hlby, G.J.K., and T.A.J., unpublished data) stricter conditions on the deposition of coordinates and experimental data in public data banks. Access to the experimental data is crucial for other workers to be able to properly assess the quality of (important aspects of) a model [19, 20]. If an electron density map is available, distinguishing unusual but genuine features of a model from model-

building errors or refinement artifacts is made much easier. This observation has motivated us to develop the Uppsala Electron Density Server (EDS; J.Y. Zou, M.R. Harris, T. Taylor, A. Wa¨ hlby, G.J.K., and T.A.J., unpublished data). This server provides access to various statistics, plots, and an electron density map for every PDB entry for which structure factors have been deposited and for which automatic map calculation succeeds (at present ‫ف‬90% of all entries with structure factors).
Here, we have used the fraction of entries for which

The tendency of macromolecular crystallographers to deposit their experimental data is strongly negatively correlated to the free R value of their models.

Ways & Means 471

an electron density map file exists in EDS as an indicator of the extent to which crystallographers deposit their experimental data. As can be seen in Table 1, a map is available for about 30% of the crystal structures (the low fraction for the year 2000 is probably due to structure factor entries being “on hold” and possibly also to processing backlogs at the PDB and/or EDS). The fraction of entries for which EDS maps are available is not correlated with resolution (linear correlation coefficient Ϫ0.06 for 15 data points). Interestingly, however, said fraction is strongly correlated with the free R value of the study (linear correlation coefficient Ϫ0.86 for 19 data points; Figure 8). This means that the worse the free R value of a model, the less inclined the crystallographer is to deposit the experimental data which the model is supposed to explain! Structure factors are deposited for around 40% of the entries with free R values in the range of 0.15 to 0.2, but this number drops to about 20% for entries with free R values in excess of 0.3. The fraction of entries for which EDS maps are available is also correlated with the percentage of outliers in the Ramachandran plot, but weaker than with the free R value (linear correlation coefficient Ϫ0.68 for 14 data points).
Conclusions and Outlook Looking back on the past decade, we see that the small set of quality indicators used here shows only modest improvements in structure quality. As our science adopts a more industrial approach, it will become even more important to improve methods in general and verification methods in particular.
It appears that improvements in experimental methodology are exploited to tackle larger and larger systems, leaving the average resolution essentially constant at ‫ف‬2.2 A˚ . However, this also means that poor, low-resolution models are here to stay, unless (1) crystallographers become significantly better at building, refining, and validating their models; (2) referees become significantly better at critically evaluating the models and data (and at requesting additional data if these are not provided with the manuscript); and (3) journal editors become significantly better at insisting on deposition of both model coordinates and experimental data, as well as on inclusion of “vital parameters” [21] in papers describing macromolecular crystal structures.
Unfortunately, there still exist a lot of misunderstandings concerning the nature of the crystallographic structure determination process. For example, a recent editorial in Nature Structural Biology [22] displayed a surprising naı¨vete´ concerning the structure-solving process. It notes that “…there still seems to be some degree of art and skill to solving structures…,” despite a decade of literature on how errors can be made in that process (which, ironically, began with a commentary in the parent journal by Bra¨ nde´ n and Jones 11 years earlier [23]). Obviously, there is still a need for continuous education within the structural biology community itself. Simultaneously, we need to teach the nonspecialist users of structures to critically assess the quality of models, both with respect to their overall reliability, and in their details (reliability of important residues, ligands, etc.).
