phenotype is often described as a simple gain or loss of channel current, but the molecular details often reveal unappreciated complexity. Identiﬁcation and detailed description of the functional abnormalities the mutations produce have the potential to improve prognostic precision and pharmacological therapy. This review aims to show the bases of channelopathies by illustrating with didactic examples how the molecular properties of a population of ion channels contribute to the generation of a macroscopic ionic current and how mutations change these molecular properties to generate abnormal currents and cause channelopathies.

1. CHANNELOPATHIES: DISEASES OF ABNORMAL ION CHANNEL FUNCTION
Ion channel proteins form pathways for charged ions to cross the hydrophobic barrier of the cell membrane. The physiological importance of ion channel proteins is highlighted by a group of diseases, called channelopathies, where genetic mutations alter channel function and are associated with disease pathogenesis. At the cellular or tissue level the pathological

2. ION CHANNEL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
The phospholipid bilayers of biological membranes compartmentalize cells by impeding the diﬀusion of hydrophilic molecules in and out of the cell or internal organelles they surround. Therefore, the only path for these species to cross the membrane is through an ion channel or transporter protein embedded in the membrane. The ionic currents that ﬂow passively through ion channels can generate dynamic electrical signals, transfer ions across compartments, and couple to intracellular biochemical pathways. Two fundamental properties of ion channels, selectivity and gating, allow for organized ionic permeation while maintaining the barrier property of the membrane.1
Selectivity refers to the ability of an ion channel to allow the rapid ﬂux of a particular ionic species across the membrane while preventing the permeation of others. The structural determinants of selectivity have been mapped in many channels to a ﬁlter-like structure in the central pore that provides direct interactions to substitute for some or most of the waters of hydration that surround the ion in solution2−7 (see Figure 1). Selectivity arises from the strength of these ion−ﬁlter interactions. Ions that cannot make energetically favorable interactions are unable to shed their waters of hydration to enter the ﬁlter. Ions that interact too favorably with the ﬁlter will get stuck in the ﬁlter and not permeate well, as in the case of some blocking ions.8 The optimally permeated (selected) ions are those that desolvate, move through the ﬁlter, and resolvate on the other side with a smooth energy landscape, allowing for rapid permeation in the absence of signiﬁcant energetic barriers or wells.9 Importantly, selectivity is a key

Figure 1. Crystal structure of the KCSA potassium (K+) channel from Streptomyces lividans3 (PDB 14KC) reveals structural determinants of selectivity and gating. Four KCSA subunits (indicated by diﬀerent colors) coassemble to form a tetrameric pore structure ((A) side view, (B) top view). The important structural features are highlighted in panel C: the extracellular vestibule, selectivity ﬁlter, pore cavity, and intracellular gate (only two subunits of the tetramer are shown for clarity). Black spheres indicate resolved ions in the ﬁlter. The selectivity ﬁlter contains a sequence of amino acids (TVGYG) that is highly conserved among K+ channels. The selectivity ﬁlter is so narrow that the K+ ions must lose waters of hydration in order to ﬁt. The large energetic penalty associated with desolvation is compensated by interactions with backbone carbonyls of the selectivity ﬁlter. Na+ ions do not have the correct geometry to establish stabilizing interactions with the potassium selectivity ﬁlter, making the permeability of Na+ through KCSA less likely than that of K+. In contrast, Rb+, which has a similar geometry as K+, permeates approximately as well as K+ through KCSA.4,9 The presence of multiple ions within the selectivity ﬁlter allows for rapid permeation of K+ because the repulsive forces between the ions can dislodge the K+ from the stabilizing interaction sites within the ﬁlter.9 The entry of a new ion into the ﬁlter pushes the other ﬁlter ions along, resulting in one ion leaving the ﬁlter from the other end. This mode of permeation is analogous to the current in a wire where the rate of current ﬂow is much faster than the drift velocity of individual electronseven though the entering K+ has only moved part of the way through the ﬁlter, one positive charge has been translocated completely across the membrane. The central cavity of the pore is a wide hydrophobic tunnel ﬁlled with water molecules that allows for the ion to rejoin with waters of solvation and to continue through the permeation pathway without signiﬁcant interactions
with the protein surface. At the intracellular gate the inner helices of the four subunits form a bundle crossing that creates an impassable constriction of the permeation pathway in the closed state. As revealed by functional studies and the channel structures,10,12−18,21 local conformational changes
around the intracellular gate lead to dilation of the permeation pathway, allowing for the passage of ions at the open state. Structural studies show that Na+ and Cl− channels share similar principles of ion selectivity and permeation.6,199−201

determinant of which direction the net current will proceed through the open channel (see below).
Ion channels have evolved various mechanisms through which the ionic conductance can be turned on and oﬀ, a process known as gating, in response to various cellular signals. This process often involves a conformational change in the pore structure, resulting in an opening or impassable constriction of the ionic pathway.10−21 The stimuli for gating can be diverse, and many ion channels contain modular domains that directly sense the stimulus and then modulate the pore through domain−domain interactions (see Figure 2 for voltage-gated channel example). In other cases, the sensor and the pore are not distinct structural elements.22,23 In either case, gating involves coupled sensing and transduction steps involving several conformational states. The consequences of gating behavior are dynamic ion ﬂuxes that are responsive to chemical and physical stimuli arising from physiological processes. At the level of a single channel, opening is stochastic and binary. The channel will exhibit sojourns of zero (closed) and full (open) conductance of varying duration24 (Figure 3A). Gating stimuli modulate the probability of entering or exiting a sojourn. The conductance of a single channel when open is primarily determined by the permeation properties of the pore, while separately, the probability that the channel is open depends mainly on its gating properties.1 Of course these are simpliﬁcations as states with various conductances are possible,25 and permeation and gating are not always independent.26,27 However, this approximate model of the single-channel behavior holds well enough to provide a description of the molecular underpinnings of channelopathies.
Gating and selectivity allow ion channels to tune the ionic permeability of the membrane; however, the permeability simply provides a pathway for ions to move across the membrane. The magnitude and direction of the resulting ﬂow of ions (i.e., current) across the membrane will depend on the chemical and electrical forces driving the ions from one side of

the membrane to the other. The chemical component comes
from asymmetric distribution of ions across the membrane, whereas the force of the membrane electric ﬁeld on the charged
ion causes the electrical component. At a transmembrane
potential of 0 mV (electric component is zero), asymmetric
distribution of ions across the membrane will drive a net ionic ﬂux through the membrane due to diﬀusion (via open channels
that selectively permeate the ions), leaving behind an imbalance
of charges that alters the transmembrane potential. In the case
of a single permeant ion, this process will continue until force
of the electric potential generated by the charging of the membrane drives an ion ﬂux suﬃcient to exactly counteract the diﬀusional ionic ﬂux. At this potential, which is termed the equilibrium potential (Ve), the net transmembrane ﬂux of the ions will be zero. Because relatively few ions have to cross to
charge the membrane, the equilibrium potential is reached without signiﬁcantly changing the concentrations of ions on
each side of the membrane. Therefore, the equilibrium
potential is solely determined by the concentration gradient
of the ion across the membrane and can be calculated using the Nernst equation (eq 1).28

Figure 2. Structure of the voltage-gated, chimeric Kv1.2/2.1 K+ channel reveals the regulation of channel open probability by modular sensor domains.150 Voltage-gated K+ channels are formed by four subunits (indicated by diﬀerent colors in A and B), and each of the subunits contains a pore domain and a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) (C). The VSD contains four transmembrane helices (S1−S4), whereas the pore, like the KCSA pore (Figure 1), is formed by the coassembly of the pore domains (S5−S6) of all four subunits. The structure clearly reveals the channel’s modular nature consisting of the conserved, central K+ selective pore surrounded by the VSDs (B). VSDs as a structural module have been found in other voltage-gated channels as well as non-ion channel proteins.22−23,202−204 The VSD contains a series of positively charged residues in the S4 helix, and the membrane potential exerts a force directly upon these charges to displace the S4 segment outward or inward.187,205−210 Within the S2 and S3
helices, negatively charged residues are positioned to interact with S4 charges, providing electrostatic forces to stabilize the S4 within the membrane and deﬁne the trajectory of the S4 movement.6,150,211−213 In voltage-gated K+ channels the outward translation of the S4 helix exerts a force on the S6 segment (green) through the S4−S5 linker (magenta) that promotes the dilation of the intracellular gate to open the channel pore,214−217 and S4−S5 linker to gate interactions are found in other voltage-gated channels as well.218,219 Because of these interactions, the activation of the VSD and
the opening of the pore domain are coupled such that the activation of the sensor increases the probability of the opening of the pore (D) . The
scheme in panel D represents a general description of the regulation of a channel pore by modular sensor domains. In the scheme, Kstim represents the equilibrium constant for sensor activation, which is a function of physiological stimulation; Kopen is the equilibrium constant for the intrinsic pore opening, which is independent of the presence of stimulation; and θ represents the coupling between the sensor and pore domains whereby sensor
activation in response to stimulation leads to increased pore opening.

membrane is permeable (i.e., contains open ion channels of appropriate selectivity). The current through each open channel will bias the membrane potential toward the equilibrium potential for selected ions. As a result of the competition among these various conductances, the equilibrium potential of a single ion is not realized. Rather, a steadystate resting potential that is in between the equilibrium potentials of the various ions will be established at which point the net current, rather then the net ﬂux of any particular ion, will be zero. Because there is a net ﬂux of individual ion species at the resting potential, the ionic gradients would be dissipated over time. However, biological membranes contain active transporter proteins that move ions against their electrochemical gradient by hydrolyzing ATP or utilizing gradient of other ions. These transporters maintain the asymmetric distribution of ions across the membrane. If only monovalent ions are taken into account and the small but signiﬁcant contribution of electrogenic transporters is ignored,29 the resting potential can be calculated as an average of the equilibrium potentials of the various ions weighted by the relative permeability of the membrane to those ions, as in the Goldman−Hodgkin−Katz equation (eq 2).28 This is often an

accurate approximation as the permeability to divalent cations is low in many cells at the resting potential.

Figure 3. Various scales of electrophysiology. (A) The single ion channel is the molecular determinant of cellular electrophysiology and the therapeutic target for pharmacological approaches to treating channelopathies. At the level of the single channel, the current is all or nothing24 due to the opening and closing of the channel gate(s) (right; CO and OC indicate the ﬁrst closed-to-open and open-to-closed transitions, respectively). A
circuit model consisting of a battery (Ve), a resistor (r), and a switch (Po) can be used to represent a single ion channel (center). The battery represents the potential generated by asymmetric distribution of permeant ions (the Nernst potential). The selectivity property of the channel determines what ions will permeate and therefore helps to determine the value of Ve. The resistor reﬂects the ability of the channel to conduct ionic current; resistance is the inverse of conductance (r = γ−1). The switch represents the gating property of the channel through which the conductance can be turned fully on or oﬀ (single-channel current is all or none). The probability that the switch is open is determined by the probability that the channel gate(s) are open. By convention the membrane potential is deﬁned with respect to the potential inside the membrane (Vm = Vin − Vout). The diﬀerence between the membrane potential and the equilibrium potential (Vm − Ve) is called the driving force. This is the equivalent potential that is dropped across the resistor and is therefore linearly related to the magnitude of the current through the resistor by Ohm's law (eq 3). (B)
Expressing ion channel proteins in heterologous cells, such as Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines (e.g., Chinese Hamster Ovary and Human
Embryonic Kidney 293 cells), allows for the observation of currents generated by an essentially homogeneous population of channels due to relatively low expression of channel proteins in these cells. Macroscopic currents recorded from these cells reﬂect the summed ensemble of many
single-channel currents resulting in an apparently smooth response to stimulation. For this reason, the circuit model of a channel population lumps single-channel conductance (γ) and the open probability (Po) with the total number of channels (N) into the macroscopic conductance (G). In the circuit model G is represented as a variable conductor as Po changes in response to physiological stimuli (eq 4). (C) Native cells are yet more complex as they express many diﬀerent populations of ion channels in the membrane. These channel populations are coupled through both the membrane potential and the physical-chemical environment. Take a simple case of a cell containing only two channel populations, one Na+ channels (Na+-selective) and the other K+ channels (K+-permeable), and both are activated by voltage. The opening of the Na+ channels will bias the membrane potential toward the equilibrium potential for Na+ (usually around +50 mV). This depolarization of the membrane potential will open the voltage activated K+ channels that in turn bias the potential back toward the K+ equilibrium potential (usually around −70 mV); meanwhile Na+ channels are closed by inactivation (see main text for the description of inactivation), allowing the K+ channels to dictate the membrane potential.
This interplay between the channel populations results in the generation of dynamic electrical signals, known as action potentials, that depend on the
properties, shown in eq 4, for all channels present. Models of these complex systems can be built by connecting the models of individual channel populations (like in B, center) in parallel.220 In all these circuit models (A−C), the ability of the membrane to separate charged ions is represented as
a capacitor in parallel (as shown in C, center).

neuron lies close to the equilibrium potential for K+ because the nerve cell membrane at rest is far more permeable to K+ than Na+ or Ca2+, while chloride is passively distributed.
Generally, the current carried through a membrane by one
ionic species is linearly related to the membrane potential. The diﬀerence between the membrane potential and the equilibrium potential, which quantiﬁes the driving force, dictates the
magnitude and the direction of the current. This linearity
breaks down when conductance is a function of voltage as in

the voltage-gated channels (see section 3.3) or rectifying channels where charged blocker molecules bind within the membrane electric ﬁeld causing the I−V relation to deviate from linear.

Figure 4. Metabolism of ion channel proteins. Ion channels are synthesized into and across the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Channels that achieve a proper fold go on to traﬃc through the ER and Golgi compartment while undergoing post-translational modiﬁcations en route to the target membrane. Improperly folded channels are recognized by the ER quality control machinery and targeted for removal from the ER membrane and proteasomal degredation within the cytosol. After a period of residency within the target membrane, mature channels are taken up from the membrane into vesicles that can be later returned to the membrane (recycling) or targeted to the lysosome for degredation.95

membrane potential (V), Ve is the equilibrium potential for ion x (V), and (Vm − Ve) is the driving force (V).
If the membrane potential is more positive than the equilibrium potential, the driving force (Vm − Ve) will be positive and the current carried by the movement of the ions
will be outward. On the other hand if the membrane potential
is more negative than the equilibrium potential, the driving force will be negative and the current will ﬂow inward.
Ultimately, it is the net macroscopic current across the whole membrane, as described by eq 3, that aﬀects ionic homeostasis
and transmembrane potential (outward current hyperpolarizes
the membrane whereas inward current depolarizes the
membrane). This macroscopic current is the sum of all of the
currents generated by individual ion channels in the membrane
(Figure 3B). Therefore, to express the total current (Ix) in terms of the molecular properties of single ion channels, eq 3
can be expanded as follows:

I = NγPO(Vm − Ve)

(4)

where I is the macroscopic current generated by a
homogeneous population of ion channels (A), N is the number of ion channels in this population, γ is the conductance of a
single open ion channel (S), Po is the probability that the channel is open, Vm is the membrane potential (V), and Ve is the equilibrium potential for the ion selected by the channel
(V).
Mutations in genes encoding ion channels can alter the
number of channels (N) in the membrane, the single-channel conductance (γ), the gating (Po), or the selectivity that determines the equilibrium potential (Ve). These changes in molecular behavior result in a pathological increase or decrease
of the macroscopic current. Through the following examples we
will demonstrate the mechanisms through which mutations alter each of the molecular properties of ion channels (N, γ, Po,

and Ve), change cellular electrophysiology, and are linked to disease symptoms. The characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis is of great importance to the design and selection of therapeutics. Unfortunately, many mutations can aﬀect multiple channel properties, making eﬀective treatment challenging.
3. DISEASE-ASSOCIATED MUTATIONS ALTER ION CHANNEL PROPERTIES
3.1. Number of Channels
The lifecycle of an ion channel is multifaceted and dynamic. Peptide synthesis and folding of the nascent chain into the quaternary channel structure occurs in the ER. Post-translational modiﬁcation, which decorates the protein with sugars and other regulatory molecules, occurs as the channel is traﬃcked through the ER and Golgi networks before the mature protein is delivered to the target membrane. After some time in the membrane, channels are returned to the cytoplasm in vesicles for recycling back to the membrane or targeting to the lysosome for degradation (Figure 4). This balance between synthesis, degradation, and relocation presents many points for the regulation or pathological dysregulation of the number of channels in a target membrane, sometimes leading to disastrous results.
3.1.1. CFTR ΔF508: A Poorly Folded Channel. Cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) is the most common fatal inherited disease among the white population.30 CF is an autosomal recessive disorder involving multi-organ dysfunction associated with defective epithelial chloride conductance.31−33 Among these sequelae the resulting pulmonary disease is the largest cause of morbidity and mortality. In the lungs, chloride eﬄux into the airspaces is critical to the transport of ions and water for the maintenance of mucous hydration and eﬀective mucociliary clearance. In CF patients, blockage of airways by thick mucous leads to chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease, repeated infections, and ultimately degeneration of the lung parenchyma. Genetic mutations in CF patients have been localized to a gene encoding the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which belongs to the ATP binding cassette family of transporters.34−36 However, CFTR is not a transporter but instead carries a passive chloride conductance that is activated by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation and direct binding of ATP.37−41 The mutation found in the majority (>70% of CF patients of European descent34) of CF patients causes the deletion of phenylalanine 508 (ΔF508), resulting in channels that fail to achieve the complex glycosylation pattern that is characteristic of the mature wildtype (wt) CFTR.42 Lowered temperature can rescue the maturation defect of ΔF508, suggesting that ΔF508 is associated with a conformational change that prevents the mutated channel from maturing.43,44 Consistent with this idea, limited proteolysis shows that the conformation of ΔF508 is diﬀerent from mature wt CFTR but resembles a folding intermediate of wt CFTR. Furthermore, the kinetics and pathway of degradation of ΔF508 and the poorly folded wt CFTR intermediate are similar.45 These results suggest that ΔF508 stabilizes an improperly folded conformation of CFTR that is recognized by the ER quality control machinery and prevented from progressing to the Golgi where it would have been glycosylated.46 The poorly folded wt and mutant subunits are ubiquitinated, removed from the ER membrane, and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) within the cytosol.47 Although wild-type CFTR is already an ineﬃciently folded protein such that only 25% of the translated protein matures and progresses to the membrane, the ΔF508 folding defect is so severe that this eﬃciency drops below 1%.48 As a result, the number of mutant channels that are present in the apical membrane of the pulmonary epithelial cells is very low and the chloride transport into the airways is deﬁcient.49 A class of CF therapeutics, called correctors, are being developed in order to overcome the maturation defect of ΔF508.50 Unfortunately, because the ΔF508 mutation also causes defects in gating and decreased channel stability in the membrane,51 correctors alone are unlikely to rescue epithelial chloride conductance. For this reason, potentiator molecules that ﬁx the gating defect are also being developed.50
3.1.2. PHHI: Disrupted KATP Traﬃcking. KATP channels expressed in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans play a central role in coupling blood glucose levels and insulin release. These channels are formed by the coassembly of 4 pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits (encoded by the KCNJ11 gene) and 4 sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) subunits.52−55 Members of the Kir family, including Kir6.2, are inwardly rectifying potassium channels whose typical function is to stabilize the resting membrane potential near the potassium equilibrium potential. Elevated blood glucose levels result in corresponding increases in the beta cell glucose concentration, which leads to increased ATP and decreased ADP levels. Because ATP inhibits and ADP activates KATP channels, the change in nucleotide concentrations closes the KATP channels,56 leading to a depolarization of the beta cell membrane and therefore an increased bursting activity, calcium entry, and insulin secretion.57
Loss of function mutations in either the Kir6.258 or the SUR159 subunit are associated with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI). PHHI presents early in life with severe hypoglycemia that can cause seizures, brain damage,

and death. In KATP-associated PHHI, loss of KATP currents
causes hyperexcitability of the beta cells; therefore, insulin
secretion from the pancreas occurs despite severe hypoglycemia.60 In other words, despite the dangerously low glucose
levels, blood insulin levels remain high due to constitutive secretion by the pancreatic beta cells. Treatment can require
total pancreactomy, which can lead to diabetes and digestive problems due to deﬁciencies in insulin and pancreatic enzymes, respectively. Normally Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits do not traﬃc
to the cell surface on their own and are retained in the ER when
expressed alone. A key determinant of ER retention has been identiﬁed as the RKR motif, which is present in both the Kir6.2
and SUR1 subunits. Removal of the RKR motif by truncation of
the Kir6.2 C-terminus or mutation to AAA allows Kir6.2 to be expressed to the membrane without SUR1; likewise, AAA
mutation of the SUR1 RKR motif permits expression of SUR1 subunits alone to reach the membrane.61 Proper traﬃcking of
the wt subunits appears to require 1:1 coassembly of Kir6.2 and Sur1 subunits52−55 in order to hide the RKR motifs on each of
the subunits, because the exposure of even a single RKR motif results in accumulation of the channels in the ER.61 In addition to the RKR motif, a forward traﬃcking motif has been identiﬁed in the C terminus of SUR1 that greatly decreases the surface expression of KATP when mutated.62,63 Many
mutations that have been associated with PHHI can cause defective traﬃcking of KATP,64,65 resulting in too few of these
channels in the membrane and loss of the potassium current
that would normally prevent insulin release in the setting of low
blood glucose by stabilizing the beta cell membrane at the
resting potential. Some of these mutations (such as R1437Q(23)X in SUR166) may disrupt traﬃcking due to their truncation of the forward traﬃcking signal in the SUR1 C terminus. Others (such as H259R in Kir6.263 or ΔF138867 or L1544P in SUR168) may unmask the RKR ER retention signal as traﬃcking for these mutations can be partially rescued in
heterologous expression systems by the ablation of the RKR
motifs. Not all PHHI-associated mutations demonstrate a traﬃcking defect. Some mutations can aﬀect gating of channels in the membrane instead of, or in addition to, traﬃcking.63,67,69−71 Distinguishing between these molecular mechanisms of decreased KATP current is of therapeutic interest as
drugs with actions that are limited to the surface membrane are unlikely to be beneﬁcial to patients with traﬃcking deﬁcient
channels that do not reach the membrane to be opened by the
drug. 3.1.3. Liddle’s Syndrome: Defective Channel Turn-
over. The epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are expressed
in certain epithelial tissues including in the distal nephron, the lungs, the colon, and the sweat glands.72,73 ENaCs are Na+-
selective channels that are blocked by the diuretic drug
amiloride and are thought to be formed by the tetrameric coassembly of related α, β, and γ subunits (2α:1β:1γ).74−76
This model remains controversial with evidence suggesting a possible 9 subunit structure,77 the possible involvement of a fourth (δ) subunit,78,79 and the crystal structure of a related channel displaying a trimeric architecture.80 In the distal
nephron, ENaCs expressed in the principal cells of the collecting tubules72 play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. There is a large driving force for ﬁltered Na+
ions to be reabsorbed across the apical membrane of the
principal cell in the collecting tubules due to the active pumping of Na+ across the basal membrane by the Na/K pump. However, under basal conditions the Na+ permeability

of the apical membrane is low and the Na+ ions remain in the ﬁltrate and are excreted along with water in the urine. A drop in blood pressure activates the renin-angiotensin system, leading to increased secretion of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal medulla. Aldosterone acts at the principal cell to upregulate ENaC channel expression, resulting in increased membrane Na+ permeability, the reclamation of ﬁltered Na+, and the reabsorption of water that follows the osmotic gradient generated by the Na+ reuptake.81 Through these mechanisms the extracellular volume can be decreased or increased in response to changes in blood pressure to maintain homeostasis.
Liddle’s syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease that causes severe and early-onset hypertension despite low plasma renin and aldosterone levels and is associated with mutations of ENaC.82−86 Liddle’s syndrome associated mutations are located in the cytoplasmic C terminus of the ENaC subunits, disrupt or delete a conserved protein motif (the PY motif), and cause an increased number of ENaC channels in the apical membrane.82−84,87−92 In wild-type channels the PY motif interacts with the WW domain on another protein, Nedd4-2.93 Nedd4-2 is an ubiquitin ligase (E3) and catalyzes the ﬁnal step of an enzymatic cascade that results in the covalent linkage of ubiquitin to lysine residues94 in the ENaC N terminus. Ubiquitination of membrane proteins,95 including ENaC,96 signals for reuptake from the surface membrane and targeting to the lysosome for eventual degradation. In Liddle’s syndrome ubiquitination of mutant ENaC channels by Nedd4-2 is lost due to disruption of the protein−protein interaction, resulting in an enhanced stability of ENaC channels in the membrane97 and increased Na+ permeability even under conditions of low aldosterone. In heterologous expression, mutation of the ubiquitinated lysines, or overexpression of an enzymatically inactive Nedd4 mutant, increases the number of expressed ENaC channels in the surface membrane with a corresponding increase in Na+ conductance.96,98 In patients with Liddle’s syndrome the increased number of ENaC channels in the apical membranes of principal cells in the collecting ducts leads to pathological reabsorption of Na+ and water, generating volume overload and severe hypertension as seen in a mouse model carrying a Liddle syndrome mutation when fed a high salt diet.99 Treatment for Liddle’s syndrome involves a low-salt diet and an ENaC-blocking drug, such as amiloride.100
3.2. Driving Force
3.2.1. APA and FH-3: Loss of Ion Selectivity. Primary aldosteronism (PAL) is a form of hypertension that is caused by constitutive secretion of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal glands. Normally low intravascular volume leads to aldosterone production through the renin-angiotensin signaling pathway, and aldosterone acts at the kidneys to increase Na+ and water retention, leading to a compensatory increase in volume (see section 3.1.3). In PAL, aldosterone is continuously produced by the adrenal glomerulosa cells despite low plasma renin/angiotensin, hypokalemia and hypertension.101 Patients suﬀer from hypertension that is resistant to treatment, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis (aldosterone dependent Na+ reabsorption drives K+ and H+ excretion). Severe hypertension puts these patients at risk for cardiovascular events such as stroke and myocardial infarction.102 PAL can be caused by diﬀerent mechanisms, a frequent cause is an adrenal producing adenoma (APA),103 a benign adrenal tumor that occurs sporadically. More rare are inherited mutations that cause adrenal hyperplasia and increased aldosterone production

in the Familial Hyperaldosteronism (FH). Recently, mutations
in the KCNJ5 gene encoding an inwardly rectifying potassium
channel (Kir3.4 or GIRK4) have been found to be a common cause of APA (G151R, T158A, L168R)104 and present in ﬁve FH type-3 kindred (G151R, G151E, T158A).104,105 All of these mutations are located either directly within the selectivity ﬁlter or play a likely role in the stabilization of the ﬁlter structure
according to the recent structure of the related Kir2.2 channel.106 The functional eﬀect of all of these mutations is a loss of potassium selectivity giving rise to signiﬁcant Na+ current and depolarization of the cell membrane.104,105 In
glomerulosa cells, membrane depolarization opens voltagegated Ca2+ channels, providing calcium inﬂux that triggers aldosterone production.107 Expression of the APA associated
T158A mutation in an adrenal carcinoma cell line, to simulate
in vivo cellular conditions, caused increased aldosterone
production and increased expression of genes involved in the production of aldosterone.108 Further, these eﬀects were shown to be dependent on the inﬂux of Na+, Ca2+, and on calmodulin108 supporting the proposed mechanism that the
mutant Kir3.4 mediates constitutive aldosterone secretion through calcium dependent pathways.104 It was also proposed that the increased Ca2+ inﬂux triggers an increase in cell mass underlying the hyperplasia present in APA and FH.104 However, this hyperplastic eﬀect has not been recapitulated in vitro indicating,108 perhaps, that some other factor is required or that the cell growth is not simply a direct eﬀect of depolarization and Ca2+ inﬂux. To this point, two mutations of the same position (G151E, G151R) cause diﬀerent cellular and clinical phenotypes. G151E generates a larger abnormal Na+
current and is associated with milder disease and has not been found in APA, while G151R generates a smaller Na+ inﬂux but is associated with more severe disease. These ﬁndings are
resolved by the robust cytotoxicity caused by G151E, but not
G151R. The constitutive aldosterone production by G151E
expressing cells is blunted by increased rates of cell death
showing why the milder disease phenotype and absence of adenomas expressing G151E.104 These mutations illustrate that
there is not a simple relationship between membrane
depolarization and cellular mass. Treatment of PAL depends
on the underlying pathology. While APA tumors are welldeﬁned and conservative surgical excision is eﬀective, FH is
caused by germline mutations and therefore is associated with diﬀuse adrenal gland dysfunction. For FH patients treatment
often involves a more severe approach, bilateral adrenalectomy.103 Perhaps in the future, identiﬁcation of patients with KCNJ5 mutations will allow for eﬀective control of hyper-
tension with less drastic treatment such as a blocker targeting
the adrenal Kir3.4 channel. 3.2.2. SVD: Another Case of Lost Ion Selectivity.
Snowﬂake vitreoretinal degeneration (SVD) is an inherited
ocular disease characterized by the degeneration of the vitreous,
retinal and corneal abnormalities, and crystal deposits in the retina that resemble snowﬂakes. Patients with SVD experience
early onset cataracts and carry a moderate risk of retinal detachment, but usually retain visual acuity.109 Mutation of the
KCNJ13 gene on chromosome 2 has been associated with SVD.110,111 KCNJ13 encodes an inwardly rectifying K+ channel,
Kir7.1, with a low single channel conductance and low sensitivity to extracellular K+ and Ba+ compared to other inward rectiﬁer K+ channels.112,113 Kir7.1 has been detected in
rat and bovine retinal pigmented epithelium where it is thought to play a role in K+ transport,114,115 and has also been detected

in the human retina and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE).111 The SVD associated Kir7.1 mutation, R162W, causes a loss of K+ selectivity resulting in a current that reverses at −9 mV (as compared to the equilibrium potential of K+ at −90 mV) under the experimental ionic conditions used.111 This result indicated that the R162W Kir7.1 in the retina and the RPE would generate an inward depolarizing cation current rather than the outward K+ current of the wild type channel. The mechanism of how these defects eventually lead to the pathology of SVD remains unclear. Interestingly, R162W is not located in or near the selectivity ﬁlter like the APA associated KCNJ5 mutations (see section 3.2.1) instead R162W is located at the membrane-cytoplasm interface in a putative binding site for the regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). How a mutation at this location in the channel structure leads to a loss of selectivity is unclear and remains to be studied.
3.3. Channel Gating

An increase in ion channel open probability (Po) in response to an external stimulus is called activation (Figure 2 shows an example of activation in response to a voltage stimulus). Conversely, removal of the stimulus causes a reduction in open probability, known as deactivation. Some channels have additional gating processes that reduce open probability when the stimulus is still present, which is called channel inactivation. In the case of the voltage-gated Na+ channel in excitable cells, inactivation occurs several milliseconds after activation to produce a quick spike in current after a change to positive potential (Figure 5D). The structural motifs for activation and inactivation, i.e., the activation gate and inactivation gate are usually distinct and located separately in the channel protein.
Mutations that aﬀect activation, deactivation, or inactivation can lead to channelopathies. We describe two mutations that directly modify channel gating to cause disease. The ﬁrst adversely aﬀects channel activation while the second impairs channel inactivation. Both mutations result in the Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), which is described below.
Patients with LQTS are typically identiﬁed after they or family members experience dizziness, heart palpitations, or even an episode of ventricular ﬁbrillation (VF).116 In terms of dizziness the symptom is caused by a lack of adequate blood circulation. Palpitations occur if the heart is not generating its rhythm normally, but instead is excited via triggered activity or a reentrant arrhythmia- when normal heart excitation does not self-terminate and pathologically re-excites previously excited tissue in an unregulated fashion. The rapid heartbeat that ensues is felt as palpitations. If a patient experiences VF, death can occur if the patient is not quickly resuscitated, usually via a strong electrical shock, known as deﬁbrillation. A subsequent visit to a physician usually results in the detection, via electrocardiogram, of a prolonged QT interval, the time duration between the Q and T points on the electrocardiogram (ECG) (Figure 5).116,117
The QT interval, as a reﬂection of ventricular excitation is dependent on ventricular myocyte action potential duration (APD). Since APD is linked to the magnitude of the inward and outward currents, any change in these will alter the QT interval. Parts D and E of Figure 5 show examples where either inward Na+ current, INa, or outward K+, IK, is increased or decreased, respectively to prolong APD and therefore the QT interval.

Figure 5. QT interval and action potential (AP) prolongation caused by genetic mutations. The ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart reﬂected on the body surface, and the waveform of ECG correlates with electrical depolarization and repolarization of the cardiac muscle in various chambers (A, B). The ﬁrst upward deﬂection in panel B (P wave) corresponds to activation of the upper heart chambers, the left and right atria (LA and RA, respectively), which collect blood that is returning from the body (RA) and the lungs (LA). The prominent spike formed by the Q, R, and S points is linked to excitation of the massive lower chambers, the left and right ventricles (LV and RV, respectively). The magnitude of the QRS complex is a consequence of the larger ventricular muscle mass, which is needed to generate the force that pushes blood through the body (LV) and the lungs (RV). Finally, the T wave occurs when the ventricles return to an electrical resting state. Consequently, we would expect that a prolonged QT interval is caused by an increase in the time that the ventricles remain in an electrically excited state. The individual cells in the myocardium, myocytes, each generate an action potential (AP) (C) that is responsible for excitation. Therefore, the QT interval (B) corresponds to the duration of the ventricular AP (C), implying that any change in AP duration (APD) will aﬀect the QT interval. APD is determined by a delicate balance of inward and outward ionic currents. The morphology of the AP (C) is the consequence of positively charged Na+, Ca2+, and K+ ions entering and exiting the myocyte. For example, as the membrane potential (Vm) rises from its resting state, caused by the excitation of a neighboring myocytes, Na+ channels open and positively charged Na+ ions enter the cell (D). This inward sodium current (INa) causes Vm to rise quickly. Once Vm is elevated by INa, voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels open and bring in a sustained inward Ca2+ ﬂux, ICa,L221 (not shown). It is this inﬂux of Ca2+ that signals contraction of the myocyte.222 The sustained ICa,L supports the AP plateau, which continues until the K+ channels open to generate repolarizing outward current (E). Throughout the AP a small inward Na+ current persists and is enhanced toward the end of the AP when channels begin to recover from inactivation, but are not deactivated yet (window current). In ventricular myocytes there are two major repolarizing K+ currents, one rapid component (IKr) and one slow (IKs).223 The IKr α-subunit, Kv11.1, is encoded by the KCNH2 (aka

HERG) gene224 and the IKs α-subunit, Kv7.1, is encoded by the KCNQ1 (aka KvLQT1) gene.143,144 Once the outward K+ ﬂux overwhelms the inward Ca2+ ﬂux, the myocyte returns to its resting state. APD is therefore determined by the balance of inward and outward ion ﬂuxes. Increasing inward currents (D) or reducing outward currents (E) will prolong APD (C) and therefore the QT interval (B).
AP prolongation is pro-arrhythmic because of its eﬀect on the L-type Ca2+ current, ICa,L. As the membrane potential repolarizes at the end of the AP, ICa,L recovers from both voltage-dependent inactivation, as Vm becomes more negative, and Ca2+-dependent inactivation, as Ca2+ is removed from the cytoplasm into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)118,119 and out into the extracellular space by the Na+−Ca2+ exchanger.120,121 Normally, deactivation occurs soon thereafter, and inward Ca2+ current stops. However, when the action potential is prolonged, ICa,L can reactivate after recovering from inactivation instead of deactivating. This reactivation causes an increase in Vm that may inappropriately excite adjacent tissue and trigger an arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death.
So far mutations in 13 genes have been associated with LQTS. Many of these genes encode cardiac ion channels,122−128 three encode auxiliary beta-subunits,129−131 while the other four are involved in the organization of ion channels to the macromolecular complexes and tethering to the cytoskeleton.132−135 Mutations in three genes are responsible for the majority of LQT mutationsa sodium channel (SCN5a) gene128 which encodes the cardiac Na+ channel, Nav1.5, and two potassium channel (KCNQ1 and KCNH2) genes,125,127 which encode the Kv7.1 and Kv11.1 channels respectively. As expected, additional inward Na+ current from SCN5a mutations126,136 and reduced outward K+ current from KCNQ1 and KCNH2 mutations cause the LQTS. However, the mechanism of how these mutations alter currents of these channels varies. For instance, hundreds of mutations in KCNQ1 alone have been associated with LQTS;137 some mutations alter channel gating,138,139 some alter channel expression,140 and yet others alter posttranslational modiﬁcation of these channels,141 while the mechanism of most of these mutations in altering Kv7.1 currents is still unknown.
3.3.1. LQT1: Defective Channel Activation. LQTS type 1 (LQT1) results from mutations to KCNQ1 gene,127 which encodes a voltage-gated K+ channel (Kv7.1) α-subunit that forms functional tetrameric channels. The α-subunit contains six transmembrane segments (S1−S6). S1−S4 form a voltagesensing domain, while S5 and S6 form the pore. In particular, S4 carries several positively charged residues (Arg and Lys) that move when the transmembrane potential changes to open and close the channel (see Figure 2). The native cardiac current, termed the slow-delayed rectiﬁer current (IKs), is carried by a channel that includes the α-subunit (Kv7.1) as well as a variable number of modulatory β-subunits (KCNE1) with a singletransmembrane segment.142−146 Mutations in the KCNE1 gene can also cause LQTS (LQT5).130 Reduction of IKs can happen through a variety of mechanisms. The case of E160K is unique however because it involves a charge switching mutation in a transmembrane helix of the voltage-sensing domain, S2.
For many years, it has been posited that negative charges within the voltage-sensing domain transmembrane spanning

domains stabilize the S4 positive charges within the hydrophobic membrane interior.147 This hypothesis was later supported with charge neutralizing mutagenesis148,149 and
with the recent crystal structure of Kv1.2/2.1 chimera channel showing salt bridges formed between the positive charges in S4 and the negative charges in S2 and S3.150 All three negative
charges found in the Kv1.2/2.1 S2 and S3 (Figure 2) are conserved in Kv7.1.138 The E160K mutation switches the negative charge near the extracellular surface of the voltage-
sensing domain in S2 to a positive charge. We hypothesized
that the addition of positive charge at this site would impair
voltage sensor movement, locking it in a particular
conformation. Subsequent experiments showed that progres-
sively adding charge (E160Q, E160A, and E160K) resulted in
slowing of channel activation that was proportional to the charge added.138 Indeed, E160K showed no current what-
soever. Subsequent biochemical and electrophysiology studies showed that this channel is able to traﬃc to the surface of the
cell, but its voltage-sensing domain is unable to make the transition from the resting to activated state.139 Thus, the
E160K mutation, preventing channel activation, removes
repolarizing current carried by IKs and causes pro-arrhythmic prolongation of the ventricular AP as in Figure 5E.
3.3.2. LQT3: Defective Channel Inactivation. In LQTS
type 3 (LQT3) the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5a)
carries a mutation(s) that causes QT interval prolongation. After voltage-gated Na+ channels open to initiate the AP, they
typically inactivate and do not play a major role for the duration of the AP. Structurally, the voltage-gated Na+ channel is related to but diﬀerent from the voltage- gated K+ channel. Instead of being formed by tetramers of identical subunits, functional Na+
channels can be formed by a large monomer that has four unique, but homologous domains (DI−DIV),151 each of which is equivalent to a K+ channel α-subunit. The diﬀerences in each
domain and the linkers between them allow each to carry out a unique function such as activation (DI, DII, and DIII),152 conferring voltage dependence to inactivation (DIV),153,154 and mediating inactivation (DIII−DIV linker).155 As with a voltagegated K+ channel subunit, each domain contains 4 transmembrane segments (S1−S4) that form a voltage- sensor and 2 segments (S5−S6) that contribute to the pore. Also like voltage-gated K+ channels, the outward movement of the S4
segments causes channel activation. Inactivation is caused by a
hydrophobic intracellular motif (IFM) that resides in the DIIIDIV linker.156 When the IFM motif binds near the channel pore,157,158 the channel can no longer conduct current. Any
perturbation to the channel that disrupts this inactivation
process results in unwanted inward current, which can prolong
the APD. One mechanism of LQT3 is incomplete inactivation
that enhances a persistent pedestal current that lasts throughout the AP and pro-arrythmically prolongs APD. The ﬁrst documented mutation to display this behavior was ΔKPQ,
which removes three residues from the inactivation-linked DIII−DIV linker (Figure 5D).126
While ΔKPQ quite dramatically aﬀects INa, other mutations are much more subtle. For example, E1295K, which resides
near the DIII S4 segment, causes a shift in the voltage
dependence of both inactivation and deactivation toward more positive potentials.159 The consequence is a shift in the socalled “window current”.160 The window current refers to a
current that occurs at when Vm is low enough that the channel is not fully inactivated, but still high enough for partial channel
activation. The result is a fraction of the channels remaining

open. In Figure 5D the inward deﬂection at the end of the AP in INa is a consequence of the window current. For E1295K Na+ channels, the window current is shifted so that it occurs at a more depolarized potential. The result is an inward current during the AP that overlaps with ICa,L window current (described above), which can cause ICa,L reactivation and dangerous triggered activity.
Finally, and even more subtly, changes in the gating kinetics can cause a nonequilibrium disruption. In this case, the steadystate inactivation and deactivation occupancies are unaﬀected. Instead, the timing of recovery from inactivation and deactivation is altered. In this case, either the rate of recovery from inactivation may be faster so that channels recover from inactivation much more rapidly than they deactivate. Conversely, if the rate of deactivation is slowed, channels will also recover faster than they deactivate and remain open for a longer period of time. In the presence of the I1768V mutation, which resides in the C-terminus after the DIV S6 segment, mutant channels recover from inactivation much more quickly than in wild type channels.161,162 Consequently, channels accumulate in the open state because recovery from inactivation is much faster than the channel deactivation. The increase in open probability due to this gating imbalance results in enhanced pro-arrhythmic, depolarizing Na+ current.
4. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In recent history, a wide variety of genetic defects that cause ion channel dysfunction have been linked to human diseases. Since ion channels exist in the membranes of all cell types and play important roles in a variety of physiological processes, channelopathies have been found in every organ system. In the central nervous system ion channels have been linked to many diseases such as, but not limited to, ataxias, paralyses, epilepsies, and deafness indicative of the roles of ion channels in the initiation and coordination of movement, sensory perception, and encoding and processing of information. These channelopathies in the nervous system often involve complex function of neural networks and it is diﬃcult to trace the symptoms back to an abnormality of a single channel property. In this review we have presented only examples of peripheral channelopathies as the simpler tissue networks and organization make connecting the molecular, cellular, tissue and organ scales more approachable.
There is a great diversity of ion channels that are selective to various ions and are activated by a vast array of physiological stimuli. Aside from Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− channels that are selectively permeant to these major ions inside and outside of cells, channels that are selective for protons22,23 or permeate other metal ions such as iron (Fe2+) 163, zinc (Zn2+)164 and magnesium (Mg2+)165 or selectively permeate water molecules166,167 are also essential in important physiological processes. The physical and chemical changes that accompany these physiological processes serve as signals to open and close ion channels; these signals include membrane potential, heat,168 mechanical stretch,169 extracellular neurotransmitters,170 and intracellular cell signaling molecules such as G-proteins,171 cyclic nucleotides,172,173 phospholipids,174−176 and Ca2+.177−179
Much work has been done to understand how channels are altered and how these alterations cause disease phenotypes. Despite the diversity of ion channels and the wide variety of channelopathies, the function of ion channels is described by a simple equation, Ichannel = NgchannelP0(Vm − Vr), which relates the magnitude of ionic current to the number of channels, how

much current a single channel carries, the probability of each
channel being open, the ionic selectivity and the membrane
potential. This elegant description of ion channel function allows a few examples presented here to show how the diﬀerent
components of this equation are perturbed by mutations to aﬀect organ function. Cystic ﬁbrosis, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, and Liddle’s syndrome are all
related to changes in the number of channels (N). While the driving force, (Vm − Ve), is altered by a loss of selectivity in set of patients with Adrenal Producing Adenoma/Familial Hyperaldosteronism or Snowﬂake Vitreoretinal Degeneration. Po is aﬀected by changes in gating properties- we presented two
instances that result in the Long QT syndrome. Surprisingly we
were unable to identify an example of a mutation in an ion
channel causing disease by altering single channel conductance.
The reasons for this are unknown, but we can speculate that
such instances exist unappreciated by the literature due to the diﬃculty associated with recognizing such a mechanism. First, recording single channel currents is technically diﬃcult and
therefore not measured in many studies. Second, if the
mutation completely eliminates single channel conductance it
becomes indistinguishable from a mutation that simply reduces
open probability to zero. Therefore only a subtle reduction or
an increase in single channel conductance could be readily
linked to disease pathogenesis. Of course these more subtle changes can be diﬃcult to detect and may not cause enough of
a defect in the macroscopic current to generate symptoms.
Although the gain or loss of channel function according to
the above equation accounts for the cellular and higher-order
phenotypes, much remains to be learned regarding the
molecular mechanisms that cause channel dysfunction. For example, in LQT1 why a particular mutation causes a traﬃcking
defect, while another alters gating is only beginning to be understood. Mechanistic studies beyond the initial identiﬁca-
tion of disease-associated mutations and new advances in
experimental methodology will allow us to answer some of
these questions. One major push is to obtain crystal structures
of the disease-linked channels, which will illuminate the
structural environment in which mutations reside. For example
while the Kv7.1 channel is homologous to the already solved Kv1.2 structure,180 a close comparison of the sequences shows that there are many regions, including intracellular region near S4 that are clearly diﬀerent. Moreover, several LQT1-linked mutations reside in this region.181−183 Even less homology is observed between the Kv11.1 K+ channel and Kv1.2 K+ channels. Kv11.1 channels are linked to inherited LQT2 as well as acquired LQT, which is caused by many common drugs including antibiotics, anti- histamines, and antipsychotics.184 Another recent technique is voltage clamp ﬂuorometry,185−187 which utilizes ﬂuorescence to correlate protein motion with
ionic current. One commonly labeled location is the extracellular S3−S4 linker next to the S4 segment in the
voltage sensing domain. When a voltage stimulus is applied, the
S4 segment moves outward, and the environment around the ﬂuor changes. These environmental changes, correlating to the S4 motion, are reﬂected in the magnitude of the ﬂuorescence
and measured with a sensitive detector. In the near future, this
technology is likely to be applied to understanding disease mutations to identify speciﬁc gating transitions that are aﬀected
by inherited genetic defects. Finally, the cellular context is vital
to understanding diseases. Often, channels introduced into
heterologous expression systems display highly variable phenotypes depending on which system was chosen.188 The

ideal situation would be access to native human cells, which are unfortunately not often available. A recent advance in stem cell technology, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, oﬀers a way forward.189 iPS cells are obtained initially as ﬁbroblasts from a skin biopsy, then transformed into pluripotent stem cells hormonally. Once the stem cells are induced, they can be transformed once again into a diﬀerentiated cell such as a cardiac myocyte.190 The ability to obtain cells from a patient that is carrying a mutation, not only allows study of the mutation in a native context, it also provides a means for assessing why some mutation carriers show a deadly phenotype while others are asymptomatic.
In this review, we have presented examples of diseases for which a single mutation within an ion channel gene segregates with disease symptoms. The study of these (often rare) monogenetic channelopathies identiﬁed new ion channels underlying various physiological currents and yielded great insight into the structure−function relationships of ion channel proteins. In some cases, the ﬁeld has come full circle by providing clinically useful insight of prognostic and therapeutic value. The wide expression of ion channels in all tissue indicates that the role of ion channels in disease pathogenesis must extend beyond the identiﬁable monogenic channelopathies. Many human diseases cannot be attributed to a single diseaselinked mutation. Instead disease such as type II diabetes,191 schizophrenia,192 and essential hypertension193 involve the interplay of many genes and environmental factors. Although not the primary insult, ion channel dysregulation may play important roles in the pathology associated with polygenic diseases. In our new frontier where genome wide association can be quantiﬁed, we can now begin to detect the correlation between variations in ion channel genes and these diseases.194−198 As these links are made they will warrant additional investigation into the variations in the molecular properties of the identiﬁed ion channels that confer additional risk for disease.
