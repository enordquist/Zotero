s Abstract This paper reviews the molecular theory of hydrophobic effects relevant to biomolecular structure and assembly in aqueous solution. Recent progress has resulted in simple, validated molecular statistical thermodynamic theories and clariﬁcation of confusing theories of decades ago. Current work is resolving effects of wider variations of thermodynamic state, e.g., pressure denaturation of soluble proteins, and more exotic questions such as effects of surface chemistry in treating stability of macromolecular structures in aqueous solution.

INTRODUCTION
In the past several years, there has been a breakthrough, associated with the efforts of a theoretical collaboration at Los Alamos (1–11) but with important antecedents (12–16), on the problem of the molecular theory of hydrophobic effects. That breakthrough is the justiﬁcation for this review.
One unanticipated consequence of that work has been the clariﬁcation of the Pratt-Chandler theory (17). Judged empirically, that theory was not less successful than is typical of molecular theories of liquids. But the supporting theoretical arguments had never been compelling and engendered signiﬁcant confusion. That confusion was signaled already in 1979 by the view (18): “The reason for the success of their theory may well be profound, but could be accidental. We cannot be sure which.” Today, the correct answer is both, though accidental ﬁrst. In an amended form, it is a compelling theory. In reviewing these developments, a signiﬁcant volume of intervening theoretical work must eventually be viewed again in this new light. In addition, the work that clariﬁed the Pratt-Chandler theory suggested several improvements and extensions, and was deepened by the parallel development of the molecular quasichemical theory of solutions (11, 19–23).

this basis, I predict an extended period of consolidation of the theory of these systems and inclusion of more realistic, interesting, and exotic instances.
This review seeks scholarly patience in addressing the foundations without prejudging speculations ellicited by the fascinating biophysical motivations. Thus, physical chemists working at strengthening those foundations are the audience for this review.
Nevertheless, clarity of the biophysical goals is important. Thus, an uncluttered expression of the motivation and the basic problem is essential. The molecular theory of hydrophobic effects is an unsolved facet of a molecular problem foundational to biophysics and biochemistry: the quantitative molecular scale understanding of the forces responsible for structure, stability, and function of biomolecules and biomolecular aggregates. I estimate that the term hydrophobic appears in every biophysics and biochemistry textbook. An intuitive deﬁnition of hydrophobic effects is typically assumed at the outset. Hydrophobic effects are associated with demixing under standard conditions of oil-like materials from aqueous solutions. A more reﬁned appreciation of hydrophobic effects acknowledges that they are a part of a subtle mixture of interactions that stabilize biomolecular structures in aqueous solution over a signiﬁcant temperature range while permitting sufﬁcient ﬂexibility for the biological function of those structures.
Preeminent characteristics of these hydrophobic interactions are temperature dependences and concurrent entropies that can be exempliﬁed by cold denaturation of soluble proteins (24). If hydrophobic effects stabilize folded protein structures, then folding upon heating suggests that hydrophobic interactions become stronger with increasing temperature through this low temperature regime. This is a counterintuitive observation.
A primitive correct step in relieving this contrary intuition is the recognition that water molecules of the solution participate in this folding process (25). Speciﬁc participation by small numbers of water molecules is not unexpected but also isn’t the mark of hydrophobic effects. For hydrophobic effects, on the contrary, a large collection of water molecules are involved nonspeciﬁcally. It is the statistics of the conﬁgurations of these water molecules at the speciﬁed temperature that lead to the fascinating entropy issues. Because of the signiﬁcance of these entropies, hydrophobic effects are naturally a topic for molecular statistical thermodynamics.
Given the acknowledged signiﬁcance of this topic, it is understandable that the literature that appeals to them is vast. Many researchers from a wide range of backgrounds and with a wide variety of goals have worked on these problems. Thus, the assertion that they are unsolved will challenge those researchers. But the unsolved assertion also reﬂects a lack of integration of principles, tools, and results to form a generally accepted mechanism of hydrophobic effects.
For example, it is widely, but not universally, agreed that the hydrogen bonding interactions between water molecules are a key to understanding hydrophobic effects. Conventional molecular simulation calculations with widely accepted molecular interaction models for small hydrophobic species in water broadly agree with experimental results on such systems (26–134). In this sense, everything is

known. Nevertheless, this complete knowledge hasn’t achieved a consensus for a primitive mechanism of hydrophobic effects. By “mechanism” we mean here a simpler, physical description that ties together otherwise disparate observations. Though this concept of mechanism is less than the complete knowledge of simulation calculations, it is not the extremely “poetic ‘explanation’” famously noted by Stillinger (135). The elementary simpliﬁcations that lead to a mechanism must be more than rationalizations; they must be veriﬁable and consistent at a more basic level of theory, calculation, and observation.
The breakthrough mentioned in the ﬁrst paragraph is particularly exciting because it hints at such a mechanism for the most primitive hydrophobic effects. A great deal more research is called for, certainly. But discussion of that development is a principal feature of this review.

WHAT CHANGED

The breakthrough required a couple of steps. The ﬁrst step was the realization that feasible statistical investigations of spontaneous formation of atomic sized cavities in liquid solvents should shed light on operating theories of hydrophobic hydration (12–15, 136). Those studies could be based upon the formal truth (3, 10),

µA = −RT ln p0,

1.

where µA is the interaction contribution to the chemical potential of a hard core hydrophobic solute of type A, and p0 the probability that an observation volume deﬁned by the excluded volume interactions of A with water molecules would have zero (0) occupants. These cavity formation studies were not an attempt to calculate hydration-free energies for realistic hydrophobic solutes. The goal was just to examine simple theories and to learn how different solvents might be distinguished on this basis.

The Small Size Hypothesis
There was also a signiﬁcant physical idea alive at the time those studies were undertaken (12): “The low solubility of nonpolar solutes in water arises not from the fact that water molecules can form hydrogen bonds, but rather from the fact that they are small in size.” As a simple clear hypothesis, this view contributed to the breakthrough although the hypothesis was eventually disputed (13, 137).
Packing and molecular sizes are important concerns for liquids because they are dense. The idea was that since water molecules are smaller than, say, CCl4 molecules, the interstitial spaces available in liquid water would be smaller than those in liquid CCl4. The ﬁrst disputed point was that this hypothesis was suggested by the approximate scaled particle model (138, 139) and that model was known to have ﬂaws (135, 140) as applied to hydrophobic hydration. The second disputed point was that treatment of the coexisting organic phase, liquid CCl4 in this discussion, was less convincing than the treatment of liquid water: the modeling of a

compressibility is smaller for water than for these organic solvents, is less strongly temperature dependent, and has a minimum near 46◦C. The critical temperatures of

these organic solvents are all substantially less than the critical temperature of liquid

water.

CCl4 molecule as a simple ball is an oft-convenient canard but shouldn’t be taken too literally. Another signiﬁcant consideration is that liquid water is less dense on a packing fraction basis than most coexisting organic solvents.
Eventually (13–15, 136), the direct simulation investigations at the low pressures of ﬁrst interest indicated that the most probable spontaneously occurring cavities might be smaller in typical organic solvents than in water, though the differences are small. What was decidedly different between water and organic solvents was the ﬂexibility of the medium to open cavities larger than the most probable size. Water is less ﬂexible in this regard, stiffer on a molecular scale, than typical organic liquids. Figure 1 gives a macroscopic experimental perspective on this relative stiffness. Furthermore, the results for the organic phase were not at all similar to what scaled particle models suggested (14, 15). So as an explanation of the distinction between water and common organic solvents, the small size mechanism must be discounted (91, 141, 142; T. Lazaridis, private communication). Nevertheless, we can anticipate subsequent discussion by noting that the equation of state of the solvent is important in establishing thermodynamic signatures of hydrophobic hydration.
Transient Cavities Probing Packing and Fluctuations
As an analysis tool for assessment of packing in disordered phases, studies of cavity statistics should be more widely helpful (23, 40, 47, 78, 86, 88, 99, 105, 112, 133,

144–154). The interesting work of Kocher et al. (147) is notable. Those calculations studied the cavity formation work in protein interiors and that cavity formation work was seen to be larger than for comparable organic solvents. In that respect, the packing of those protein interiors was tighter and less ﬂexible than a simple oil droplet. This conclusion is signiﬁcant for our pictures of protein structures and deserves further investigation. Structural and compositional heterogeneity are undoubtedly also important features of the cores of globular proteins. These observations should be helpful in distinguishing the interiors of micelles from the cores of folded globular proteins (155).

Modeling Occupancy Probabilities

The decisive second step in achieving the present breakthrough was the modeling of the distribution pn of which p0 is the n = 0 member (1). Several speciﬁc distributions pn had been tried in analyzing the results of Pratt & Pohorille (14). But it was eventually recognized that a less speciﬁc approach, utilizing a maximum entropy procedure to incorporate successively more empirical moment information, was prudent and effective. Surprisingly, direct determination of the distribution pn showed that a two-moment model,

− ln pn ≈ ζ0 + ζ1n + ζ2n2,

2.

was accurately borne out in circumstances of computer simulation of liquid water (1). The parameters ζ j are evaluated by ﬁtting the predicted moments n j , j = 0, 1, . . ., to moment data. A practical virtue of this two-moment model is that the required moment data can be obtained from long-available experimental results. An additional surprise was that it had previously been shown, in different contexts and with additional assumptions (16, 156), that theories of a Percus-Yevick analog type had a structure derivable from a Gaussian or harmonic density ﬁeld theory. The Pratt-Chandler theory was proposed as just this type of this Percus-Yevick analog. To the extent that the empirical observation Equation 2 suggests a normal distribution, the Pratt-Chandler theory is given a better foundation than was available at its genesis (10).

Nonequivalence with the Pratt-Chandler Theory
In fact, the two-moment model shown in Equation 2 is not precisely the same as the Pratt-Chandler theory. Several related direct observations can make that point clear. For example, the probability model shown in Equation 2 assigns probability weight only to nonnegative integer occupancies. That is not the case for the harmonic density ﬁeld theory. The restriction that such density ﬁeld theories should not permit the negative occupancy of any subvolume is an obvious but interesting requirement. Additionally, the Percus-Yevick theory for hard sphere mixtures can predict negative probabilities (157). These are technical issues, however, and the performance of the two-moment model Equation 2 gives strong and unexpected support for the Pratt-Chandler theory.

414 PRATT
There is a different respect in which the correspondence of the two-moment model shown in Equation 2 with the Pratt-Chandler theory is imprecise. The kinship indicated above is based upon calculation of solvation-free energies when the solvent can be idealized as an harmonic density ﬁeld. That idea can be straightforwardly carried over to consideration of nonspherical solutes. For example, classic potentials of mean force might be addressed by consideration of a diatomic solute of varying bond length. The Pratt-Chandler theory does not do that directly but utilizes the structure of the Ornstein-Zernike equations together with yet another Percus-Yevick style closure approximation. Those distinctions have not yet been discussed fully.
Good Theories are either Gaussian or Everything
A curious feature of the ln pn moment modeling is that convergence of predictions for µA = −RT ln p0 with increasing numbers of utilized moments is nonmonotonic (6, 8, 10). The predicted thermodynamic results are surprisingly accurate when two moments are used but become worse with three moments, before eventually returning to an accurate prediction with many more moments available. The two-moment model, and also the Pratt-Chandler theory, is fortuitous in this sense. But this does conform to the adage that good theories are either Gaussian or everything.

TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS AND EXTENSIONS

The theory above has always been understood at a more basic level than the de-

scription above (10). The most important observation is that the Mayer-Montroll

series (10, 158) can be made signiﬁcantly constructive with the help of simulation

data (10, 13, 136), and those approaches can be more physical than stock inte-

gral equation approximations. Simulation data can provide successive terms in a

Mayer-Montroll series. In that case the binomial moments

are

the

cally preferred data (10). Then the maximum entropy modeling is a device for a

resummation based upon a ﬁnite number of initial terms of that series (10). Several

additional technical points are helpful at this level.

Default Models
The adage that good theories are either Gaussian or everything is serious but doesn’t address the physical reasons why these distributions are the way they are. In fact, painstaking addition of successive moments is not only painful but often unsatisfying. And the two-moment model of Equation 2 has been less satisfactory for every additional case examined carefully beyond the initial one that was connected with this breakthrough (1); recent examples can be seen in References (23, 133). It is better to consider physical models for the distribution pn and

where pˆ n is a model distribution chosen on the basis of extraneous considerations. Because pn = pˆ n in the absence of additional information, pˆ n is called the default model. Utilization of a default model in this way compromises the goal of predicting the distribution and instead relies on the moments to adapt the default model to the conditions of interest. The default model of ﬁrst interest (1) is pˆ n ∝ 1/n! This default model produces the uncorrelated result (the Poisson distribution) when the only moment used is n 0. Another way to identify default models is to use probabilities obtained for some other system having something in common with the aqueous solution of interest (8).
An important practical point is that this approach works better when the default model is not too speciﬁc (22). This can be understood as follows: The moment information used to adapt the default model to the case of interest is not particularly speciﬁc. If the default model makes speciﬁc errors, a limited amount of that nonspeciﬁc data will not correct those errors adequately. This argument gives a partial rationalization for the accurate performance of the ﬂat default model that leads to Equation 2.
In Equation 2, ζ0 = µA/RT , but it is helpful to notice that this thermodynamic quantity can be alternatively expressed as (10)

where binomial moments through order kmax are assumed and the default model is included. ζ0 does not appear on the right because that normalization factor is being expressed through the thermodynamic property. The point is that this is a conventional form of a partition function sum. The interactions are n-function interactions, in contrast to density or ρ-functional theories, but with strength parameters adjusted to conform to the data available. The fact that µA is extracted from a fully considered probability distribution, and this consequent structure, is the substance behind our use of the adjective physical for these theories. These theories are still approximate, of course, and they will not have the internal consistency of statistical mechanical theories obtained by exact analysis of a mechanical Hamiltonian system.

Quasichemical Theory
The quasichemical theory (11, 19) adapted to treat hard core solutes (23) gives an explicit structure for the µA formula as in Equation 4. That result can be regarded

A¯ is a precisely deﬁned cavity species (23) corresponding to the AW excluded volume. Equation 4 should be compared to Equation 5; because of the structural similarity, it is most appropriate to consider Equation 4 as a quasichemical approximation. The Km are well-deﬁned theoretically (23) and observable from simulations. So again this approach can be signiﬁcantly constructive when combined with simulations (11, 19, 20). But the ﬁrst utility is that the low density limiting values of Km, call them Km(0), are computable few body quantities (23). The approximation

is then a simple physical theory, the primitive quasichemical approximation (23). The Lagrange multiplier ζ1 serves as a mean ﬁeld that adjusts the mean occupancy to the thermodynamic state of interest. For a hard-sphere solute A, in a hard sphere solvent, this theory produces sensible results though it does not achieve high accuracy in the dense ﬂuid regime ρd3 > 0.6 (23), where d is the diameter of the solvent hard spheres. (The foremost questions for aqueous solutions are at the lower boundary of this conventional demarcation of dense ﬂuids.) When the accuracy of this theory for hard-sphere systems degenerates, it is because the distribution

is too broad in the low n extreme (23); see Figure 2. Because this theory thus directly treats short range molecular structure somewhat too broadly, it is a natural suggestion for generating default models. No direct experience along those lines is presently available.
The investigation of how such a simple theory (Equation 9) breaks down is a yet more interesting aspect of the development of the quasichemical theories for these problems (11, 23). For the hard-sphere ﬂuid at higher densities, the primitive quasichemical theory shown in Equation 9 remains a faithful descriptor of the n ≥ 1

The long-dashed curve next down is the primitive quasichemical model, Equation 9 (23). The solid line is an iterated quasichemical theory that
incorporates an empirical correlation correction (23) and provides a simple accurate des-
cription of these quantities for the hard-sphere ﬂuid. Note that the primitive quasichemical approximation is a good description of this distribution for n ≥ 1 but signiﬁcantly overestimates p0 at these densities.

features of the distribution. But the actual p0 (see Figure 2) becomes depressed relative to the model; p0 breaks away from the rest of the primitive quasichemical distribution. In fact, the suggested correlation correction can be effectively empiricized and provides an accurate description of these distributions for hardsphere ﬂuids. These exotic complexities with p0 are not reﬂected in Equation 2. Tiny features like that were noticed, however, in the initial simulation studies of these probability models (1). Additionally, we anticipate discussion below by noting that proximity to a low pressure liquid-vapor transition point, associated with solvent-solvent attractive interactions and potential dewetting of hard surfaces, is expected to increase p0 (1, 11).

Importance Sampling to Correct Occupancies

A more workman-like investigation of these theories can be based upon the potential distribution theorem (3, 23, 159)

e− µA/RT = e− U/RT 0 .

The brackets · · · 0 indicate the average over the thermal motion of a distinguished A solute and the solvent under the condition of no interactions between
these subsystems; the latter restriction is conveyed by the subscript 0. Distributions
pˆ n should be helpful as importance functions. It would be natural to use this estimate to revise the calculation of all the probabilities pn. But we have seen a case, Figure 2, where the distinction between n = 0 and n ≥ 1 is most interesting. In addition, this quantity averaged here (Equation 10) takes the values zero (0) if n ≥ 1 and one (1) for n = 0. Thus we consider the importance function,

Here, π 0 is the probability of the observation volume being empty with the reweighted sampling,

14.

These formulae could be used directly with simulation calculations. The best available approximate p0 (135, 163) could be used as pˆ 0 in order to achieve higher accuracy; that would be interesting but not easy because achieving n 0 → n = 0 transitions requires rare collective processes. On the other hand, n = 0 → n ≥ 1 transitions will have a low acceptance probability. But our argument here is directed toward understanding physical features left out of simple models such as the quasichemical model of Equation 4. The choice here of W in Equation 11 is transparently directed toward discussion of a two-state picture of the hydration.
With that goal, the conceptual perspective is the more interesting one. This is a discrete example of a procedure common in density functional arguments. Local particle occupancies are altered by a reweighting. Just as with p0, π 0 can be studied with a Mayer-Montroll series and moment modeling (10). The moments involved now would be obtained from study of the designed nonuniform system. The average on the right side of Equation 14 is a functional of the density induced by the reweighting.

HYDROPHOBIC EFFECTS 419

For example, if the reweighting can serve to nucleate a bubble because of
proximity of the thermodynamic state to a liquid-vapor transition, then, physically viewed, π0 is expected to be composed of two important cases: (a) vapor with a depletion region surrounding the observation volume; this gives contribution one (1) to π 0 for these cases, and (b) liquid; typically these cases contribute zero (0) to π 0. But occasional conﬁgurations, roughly with frequency pˆ 0, give e− U/RT = 1. Thus as a rough estimate, we expect,

e− F/RT π0 ≈
e− F/RT

1 − pˆ 0 pˆ 0
1 − pˆ 0 pˆ 0

+ pˆ 0 ,
+1

15.

where F is the free energy for formation of a bubble from the liquid corresponding to boundary conditions n = 0 on the observation volume. That free energy might be approximated by a combination of van der Waals theories and molecular
theories appropriate for the vapor phase (162). Let’s consider a one-phase, dense
liquid thermodynamic state, not far from coexistance with a vapor phase, so that 1 > e− F/RT > pˆ 0. With these estimates, Equations 13 and 15 evaluate to

p0 ≈ e− F/RT > pˆ 0.

16.

The insertion probability is the probability of bubble formation, surely the only simple guess, and this estimated change raises the value pˆ 0.

van der Waals Picture
On the basis of the observations above, we can construct the following picture (23) by considering how these theories would work for an atomic-sized hard-sphere solute in a simple van der Waals ﬂuid system (164). Consider packing effects ﬁrst, then subsequently the effects of attractive interactions. For dense liquid cases with full-blown packing difﬁculties, models such as those shown in Equation 2 or 9 overestimate p0 because those models aren’t accurate for packing problems in the dense ﬂuid regime. Next, consider attractive interactions and the possibility of dewetting. Those effects raise p0. The model of Equation 2 does not reﬂect those phenomena. But these two errors can compensate, so Equation 2 can be empirically accurate for atomic solutes despite the naivete´ of that model. This is another rationalization of the astonishing, fortuitous accuracy of the two-moment model and the Pratt-Chandler theory.
Two additional points may be noted. The ﬁrst point is that in discussing errors in treating packing effects, we have been concerned about errors of the same type as those in the Percus-Yevick theory for the hard-sphere ﬂuid. But the Percus-Yevick theory of the hard-sphere ﬂuid is the most successful theory of a dense liquid, “gloriously accurate, considering its simplicity” (165). So this discussion brings a high-sensitivity view to the problem. This is necessary because of the high interest in these important problems. The second point to note is that attractive interactions in this argument involve solvent-solvent interactions, not solute-solvent attractive

interactions. Part of the subtlety of these discussions is that the approach that offers models such as Equation 2 is sufﬁciently empirical that a unique identiﬁcation of the source of a particular inaccuracy is nontrivial.

HYDROPHOBIC HYDRATION AND TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCES
The most astonishing result of the new theory shown in Equation 2 is its explanation of the hydrophobic temperature dependence known as entropy convergence (2, 9–11, 133), and those temperature dependences are discussed here.

Solubilities
The solubilities of simple gases in water have some interesting complexities (166). Many simple gases have a solubility minimum in water at moderate temperatures and pressures. Because the solubility is governed by µA/RT , the temperature variation of the solubility at a ﬁxed pressure requires information on

with hA the partial molar enthalpy change upon dissolution of species A. (We consider the low concentration limit here.) Thus, a solubility minimum leads us to anticipate a temperature of zero enthalpy change for the dissolution where
µA/RT plotted as a function of T has a maximum. At a higher temperature, the dissolution of many simple gases shows approximately zero partial molar entropy change:

µA plotted as a function of T has a maximum. More puzzling is the fact that this temperature of zero entropy change is common to a number of different gases. This phenomenon is referred to as entropy convergence because the entropies of hydration of different solutes converge to approximately zero at a common temperature (167, 168).

Model Explanation
The puzzle “why?” was ﬁrst answered on a molecular level in Reference (2) on the basis of the model shown in Equation 2; see also (9–11, 133). Establishing these two temperature behaviors should go a long way toward establishing the temperature variations of hydrophobic effects throughout an extended range relevant to biomolecular structure.
If we agree to be guided by an estimate of pn based upon a continuous normal distribution (2, 9–11), then evaluation of the Lagrange multipliers of Equation 2

with v the volume of the AW excluded volume, expected to be weakly temperature dependent. The surprise is that δn2 0 varies only slightly with temperature over the interesting temperature range. This is suggestive of the data shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, the second term of Equation 20 is smaller than the ﬁrst. Therefore the plot of µA as a function of T experiences a maximum because the combination Tρ2 has a maximum as ρ = ρsat(T ) decreases with increasing temperature along the coexistence curve. To the extent that the rightmost term of Equation 20 can be neglected and v2/ δn2 0 is independent of temperature, then entropy convergence will occur and the temperature at entropy convergence will be the same for all hydrophobic solutes.
This development applies to model hard core solutes, and the convergence temperature does appear to shift slowly but systematically to lower temperatures as the volume of the solute increases. But it was disturbingly noted, nearly forty years ago, that the success of the scaled particle model in evaluating hydration entropies “. . . suggests an almost thermodynamic independence of molecular structure” (140). In the entropy convergence phenomena, we see that this almost thermodynamic independence of molecular structure is a feature of the data (168) and that the current theory gives a simple molecular explanation that solves this puzzle.
The lower temperature iso-enthalpy solubility minimum is expected to be tied to a different aspect of the solution-water interactions, the van der Waals attractive interactions. Following a van der Waals view, these effects should be reasonably described by ﬁrst order perturbation theory, so as a qualitative model we have (9, 11)

with ﬁtting parameters A, B, and C. This equation does indeed have the correct qualitative behaviors (9, 11). If Equation 21 is used as a ﬁtting model and the parameters are unrestricted, it is essentially perfect. If the parameters are constrained by physical expectations for the temperature-independent ﬁtted parameters v, δn2 0, and A, then this model is only qualitatively and crudely successful in describing experimental solubilities.
Several of these considerations have been reexamined recently with results consistent with this picture (169; H.S. Ashbaugh, T.M. Truskett, P.G. Debenedetti, private communication). Although these temperature behaviors were not always so clearly recognized as this, there remains speciﬁc solubility issues that aren’t resolved including at the simulation level. An interesting case was provided by the important simulation calculations of Swope & Andersen (39) on the solubility of inert

gas atoms in water. With regard to the Lennard-Jones solute water (oxygen) interaction models, they concluded: “For the potentials used in the present simulations, it is not possible to ﬁt the value, slope, and curvature for helium and neon without choosing what we believe to be unreasonably large values of σ . We can, however, obtain ﬁts to the data for argon and krypton with reasonable values of the diameters.” Simulation calculations for such cases have been pursued several times since then; those activities up to 1998 are summarized by Arthur & Haymet (106), and the latter effort also concludes with some ambiguity about the case of the He solute.
It is also important to emphasize that this model is used here only over a limited temperature range and at low pressure. Lin & Wood (95) used molecular dynamics to model the thermodynamic properties of small hydrocarbons in water over a wide range of temperature and pressure, and Errington et al. (109) studied the phase equilibria of water-methane and water-ethane systems over wide ranges of temperature and pressure using Monte Carlo techniques.
RECENT EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF HYDRATION STRUCTURE
In recent years, efforts to measure directly the structure of water surrounding simple hydrophobic solutes have produced results that should be of quantitative relevance to the theories discussed here (100, 170–174). A more quantitative consideration is warranted, but the initial impression is that these results are in good agreement with the calculations that have been done. These data give the weight of evidence to important basic conclusions also.
Pressure Dependence of Hydrophobic Hydration
One such conclusion is that this structuring of water appears to be independent of variations of the pressure to 700 bar (70 MPa) (173). This may be important to the current issue of pressure denaturation of soluble proteins as is discussed below. But investigation in a higher pressure range would be necessary for that purpose (119, 175).
Clathrate is in the Eye of the Beholder
Another important conclusion follows from the direct comparison of the radial distribution of oxygen atoms surrounding Kr in liquid aqueous solution and in a solid clathrate phase. Those radial distributions are qualitatively different in the two different phases. This is important because a clathrate picture of hydration structure of nonpolar solutes in liquid water is a common view of hydrophobic hydration that has not been of quantitative relevance; it has been a pictorial theory (176). In contrast, several theoretical calculations that have had quantitative value assume roughly the antithesis of clathrate, that the conditional density of water surrounding a nonspherical nonpolar solute can be built-up by superposition of proximal radial information (84, 85, 94, 177–179). The clathrate language is widely

used, hardly explicitly justiﬁed, and leads to misunderstandings. A number of studies have explicitly considered the issue of how valid the clathrate description is (54, 56, 82, 108, 116, 180, 181). The conclusion seems to be that if you look for clathrate-style hydration structures you probably see them, but if you ask whether they are necessary for a correct quantitative understanding, the answer is no. Clathrate is in the eye of the beholder. A reasonable recommendation is that when clathrate is used as a descriptor in these liquid solutions, it should be explicitly deﬁned and justiﬁed. Attempts to formulate quantitative theories on the basis of chemical models of these hydration shells are known but ill-developed (11).

POTENTIALS OF THE MEAN FORCES AMONG PRIMITIVE HYDROPHOBIC SPECIES IN WATER

The theories discussed above are straightforwardly applicable to nonspherical solutes. For a solute composed of two atoms with varying interatomic separation, the comparison

µAA (r ) − µA − µA ≡ wAA (r )

22.

leads to the classic issue of the potential of mean force (pmf ), an issue of longstanding interest (26, 51, 65, 68, 175, 182–190, 192–194, 196–208, 210–214). The model shown in Equation 2 for a simple case was tested against simulation results (1) and the comparison was close. That theory, including Equation 20, sheds new light on these properties.

Contact Hydrophobic Interactions
Consider wAA(r) for atomic solutes in contact. When the solute atoms are in van der Waals contact, we still anticipate that δn2 0 will be only weakly temperature dependent. In addition, the volume excluded to the solvent by the pair is less than twice the volume of an atom alone because of the overlap of their excluded regions. Thus the dominant contribution to Equation 22 is negative, stabilizing the contact pair, and that stabilization increases with temperature below the entropy convergence temperature. [Note that the subtraction in Equation 22 requires some additional thought when the logarithmic term of Equation 20 is addressed (6). If the subtraction were naively carried out, that r-independent nonzero difference might imply pathologically long-ranged interactions. A more careful consideration of the statistical approaches satisfactorily resolves that pathology (6). This detail shows again that these theories are not naively equivalent to the Pratt-Chandler theory.]

Noncontact Hydrophobic Interactions
On the other hand, when the atomic solutes are separated enough that a water molecule may ﬁt between them, the volume excluded to the solvent by the pair is more nearly twice the excluded volume of a separated atom. The theories

following Equation 2 then are more sensitive to water molecule correlations of longer range because the information δn2 0 depends on those correlations. These theories then produce more subtle effects. Noncontact hydrophobic interactions may be, nevertheless, signiﬁcant because of the larger conﬁgurational volume corresponding to those solvent-separated conﬁgurations. In addition, as discussed by Pratt & Chandler (215, 216), free energies of these solvent-separated conﬁgurations may be more sensitive to details of van der Waals attractive interactions than are contact conﬁgurations.
Simulation Results
These views seem to be borne out by the available simulation results, although “the conclusions drawn from previous simulation calculations have been very contradictory” (203). Substantial stability for contact hydrophobic pairs is probably the least contradictory of the possible conclusions. The recent preponderance of simulation results indicates that these contact pairs are stabilized by favorable hydration entropies (68, 199–201, 203, 204, 207, 214, 217). This would agree with the view established from the simple model shown in Equation 20, but those model temperature variations have been checked mostly along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve. The interesting results of References (203, 204) show substantial temperature variations at ﬁxed water density. It was noted (201) that the conditions of temperature increase at ﬁxed density strengthen the apparent entropic stabilization of the contact pair. That is also how Equation 20 works; the density decrease serves to moderate the temperature increase and eventually, at the entropy convergence temperature, to dominate it. But the large effects seen by the Vienna group (203, 204) make it unclear that the simple model shown in Equation 20 will be accurate for those phenomena.
Simulation results for the solvent-separated conﬁgurations are less clear also. There are entropic and enthalpic temperature effects in opposite directions with small net results (200, 204, 207). Because of the larger conﬁgurational volume for the solute pair in this conﬁguration, these smaller hydration-free energies are not negligible and “the puzzling ﬁnding that the marked hydrophobic behavior of methane-like solutes concluded from the free energy data is not reﬂected in a similarly clear manner by the second osmotic virial coefﬁcients requires a closer inspection of the underlying phenomena” (204); see also (195). There is precedent, depending on a variety of additional details, for simulation results to exhibit either hydrophobic clustering or not, i.e., “hydrophobic repulsion” (191).
Polarizability?
The complications suggested for these solvent-separated conﬁgurations seem to have lead to other contradictory results. It was suggested long ago (188) that solute polarizability might change the character of hydrophobic interactions predicted by simple theories. A later simulation calculation that included explicit polarizability (65) in the water-water interactions also suggested that these more complicated

descriptions might qualitatively change the hydration of noncontact atom pairs. Subsequent calculations again suggested that polarizability could lead to substantial changes but in a different direction from those seen earlier (202); treatment of long-ranged interactions was noted as a signiﬁcant issue in these calculations. More recent studies of interaction models that include polarizability, however, have restored an original small change view for the moment (207).
Alkane Conformational Equilibrium in Water
The potentials of mean force just discussed are relevant to consideration of the conformational equilibrium of small ﬂexible hydrophobic molecules in water. The ﬁrst test case for theories has always been the trans-gauche isomerization of nbutane (84, 91, 177, 179, 218–224). For the case of n-butane, solvent separated possibilities are not available, so the contact hydrophobic interactions are relevant. The populations of the more compact gauche conﬁgurations are enhanced by an entropic hydration effect. Hummer et al. (1) applied the model shown in Equation 2 to the case of conformational equilibrium of n-butane in water and found close agreement with the latest simulation results. Hummer has effectively adapted the model of Equation 2 so that it can be simply applied to other alkanes (225). Much longer chain molecules that have been strictly hydrophobic are less well studied primarily because they would be so unusual as isolated components of aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic groups are necessary to solubilize large molecules. Perhaps the simplest such soluble molecules would be polyethylene oxide chains that are a speciﬁc interest (226). But Gallicchio et al. (129) has recently studied the hydration of slightly larger alkanes in additional detail.
PRESSURE DEPENDENCE OF HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTIONS
The intense current interest in pressure studies of protein structure is due to the alternative light this research can shed on protein conformational dynamics. A recent example can be found in (227), but we are unable to review adequately that body of interesting work here.
The complications of the noncontact hydrophobic interactions mentioned above appear to be involved in understanding pressure denaturation of proteins, however. We identify some of that work because views of hydrophobic effects have been paradoxical for these issues (228) and because this discussion gives additional perspective on the theories above. Wallqvist reported initial studies of pressure dependence of hydrophobic interactions (180, 229). Atomic hydrophobic solutes in water clustered at low pressure but dispersed at a substantially higher pressure that wasn’t further quantiﬁed in that study. Later, the Rutgers group took an important step (205) in Monte Carlo calculations of the effects of pressure on the pmf between Lennard-Jones model hydrophobic atomic solutes in water. Hummer et al.

then developed the theory shown in Equation 2 for these pmfs as a function of pressure. That theory suggests that noncontact conﬁgurations of hydrophobic pairs become progressively more stable relative to contact pairs, and this might be a feature of pressure denaturation known to produce less disrupted structures than does heat denaturation. Subsequent molecular dynamics calculations (175) conﬁrm this picture of dispersal at higher pressures and the pressure variations of the pmfs: as pressure is increased, these pmfs become more structured, the contact minimum deepens, the desolvation barrier becomes higher; the solvent-separated well becomes better deﬁned and deeper, and it appears to deepen faster than the contact well. This work also observed clustering of hydrophobic atomic solutes at low pressure (1 atm) but dispersal at high pressure (8000 atm, 810.6 MPa). This work also saw changes in the solute-water (oxygen) radial distribution that should be observable in experimental studies such as those of Reference (173). But the simulation results are for considerably higher pressures than the experimental work reported. These calculations also considered spherical hydrophobic solutes of a larger size, more comparable with valine, leucine, or isoleucine side chains. The responses to substantial pressure increases were similar but perhaps slightly more pronounced. A physical view is that as the pressure is increased, water molecules can be jammed between contact hydrophobic pairs; this evidently results in more efﬁcient, lower-volume packing, and consequently a negative hydrationfree energy change with increasing pressure for noncontact conﬁgurations.

SIZE DEPENDENCE OF HYDROPHOBIC HYDRATION FOR HARD SPHERE SOLUTES

For a hard sphere solute, the rate of increase of the hydration-free energy shown in Equation 1 with the distance of closest AO approach, denoted by λ, produces a particularly interesting quantity,

ρW G(λ)

=

1 4π λ2

∂ µA/RT . ∂λ

23.

This ρW G(λ) is the conditional density of the solvent water (oxygen) at contact with the spherical solute. Because of the involvement of ∂ µA/∂λ, this relation describes the compressive force exerted by the solvent on the solute.

Contact Densities
Direct studies of these quantities have shown (14, 15) that in the range 2.0 A˚ < λ < 3.0 A˚ G(λ) for liquid water is approximately two times larger than for n-hexane. Water exerts a higher compressive force on the surface of an inert solute than do typical organic liquids so that water squeezes out hydrophobic solutes (230). More pertinent for the present discussion is that the Pratt-Chandler theory overestimates this compressive force and the original scaled particle model underestimates it

(14, 15). The revised scaled particle model (135) lands in the middle and does a better job at describing this compressive force. Recent work (163) has studied these quantities over a much larger range of λ and conﬁrmed the accuracy of the revised scaled particle model.
The reason for the differences between the scaled particle models and the Pratt-Chandler theory is associated with the known behavior ρW G(λ) ∼ p/RT for large λ. For the cases of ﬁrst interest, p/ρW RT 1. Because G(λ) is initially one (1) and increases initially, G(λ) decreases for large λ to achieve the small value p/ρW RT . In fact, this decreasing behavior obtains for λ > 3 A˚ , approximately. Thus, for hard sphere solutes with λ 3 A˚ the contact density can be small. This low pressure for a dense liquid is due to attractive forces between the solvent molecules. If the conditions are adjusted for liquid-vapor coexistence, then p is also the pressure of the coexisting vapor and p/RT would be the density of the vapor under the assumption that it can be treated as ideal. Under these conditions we can say, therefore, that a sufﬁciently large hard sphere solute nucleates a bubble of the vapor. These behaviors are built into the approximate scaled particle models but not into the Pratt-Chandler theory. These issues have been directly investigated for spherical model solutes moderately larger than canonical for methane (5); weak effects were found for those cases and convincing models were developed (5).
PMF for Stacked Plates in Water
This issue has been of particular interest recently because a previous calculation (231) studied the pmf between modeled stacked plates with exclusively repulsive interactions with water molecules. That work suggested that contact hydrophobic interactions in that case could be dominated by a dewetting event: the last two layers of water molecules intervening between parallel plates evacuated together.
Benzene-Benzene PMF
The comparable results for more realistically modeled benzene, or toluene, or other small aromatic solute molecule pairs are also interesting but more complicated (52, 195–198, 209, 210, 213). These molecules are slightly smaller than the stacked plates that were studied. The available thermodynamic data (232) suggest that benzene, toluene, and ethyl benzene should display conventional entropy convergence behavior. T-shaped contact pairs are more probable for benzene than a stacked arrangement is. The opposite is true for toluene (210). This is also true for the gas-phase potential energy surface though the hydration seems to enhance this distinction slightly (210). Variations in these pmfs (52, 195, 197, 198, 210, 213) are much smaller than for the modeled stacked plates (231). A dewetting transition is not obvious for the calculations with higher molecular realism. It may be that the signiﬁcance of any dewetting would be more obvious near transitional conﬁgurations such as the desolvation barrier region that separates contact from solvent-separated conﬁgurations. Though the hydration of neither of the high probability conﬁgurations discussed here (52, 197, 198, 210, 213) seemed

remarkable in this way, the variation of the free energy in the desolvation barrier region might be unusual; this deserves further checking. How these complications are affected by the more complicated environment of an amino acid side chain, e.g., phenyl alanine, in a hydrated protein is not known; the peptide backbone is, of course, highly polar. The hydrogen bonding possibilities of tyrosine or tryptophan side chains complicate things yet again. An interesting study of pairing of tryptophan-histidene side chains (213) suggested that hydration of these side chains results in stacked pairing near protein surfaces but T-contacts in protein interiors. [Continuum dielectric models did not provide a rationalization of that observed tendency (213).] The variety of the results obtained suggested (213) “. . . the importance of the atomic details of the solvent in determining the free energy for the solute-solute interactions.”
Theory of Interface Formation
The development of the theory (162) corresponding to the stacked plates data was initiated by Lum, Chandler, & Weeks; see Figure 1 there (233). Subsequently (234–237), a focus has been the study of how the entropy dominated hydration-free energies discussed above for inert gas solubilities change to the surface tension– dominated behavior expected for ideal mesoscopic hydrophobic species; see also (128). That behavior was explicitly built into the revised scaled-particle model for hard sphere solutes decades ago (135); that model is known to be accurate for water (163) and for a simple liquid (234, 236). A fundamental niche for that theoretical work (162) is the development of a molecular description of the interface formation mechanism built into the revised scaled-particle model at large sizes (162).
How these theoretical developments will accommodate heterogeneity of chemistry and structure typical of biomaterials, in contrast to the model stacked plates, is not yet established. A nice example of the issue of heterogeneity, absorption of water on activated carbon, was discussed recently by Mu¨ller & Gubbins (238). It is unreasonable to imagine that the biophysical applications will be simpler than this. It might be more appropriate at this stage of development to regard the Berkeley project as ambitiously directed toward an implicit hydration model (20) rather than an assertion of speciﬁc physical relevance of drying to biomolecular structure (P. Rein ten Wolde, S.X. Sun, D. Chandler, private communication). These problems require consideration of several distinct issues together. One such issue is the direct contributions of solute-solvent attractive interactions to hydration-free energies for a speciﬁc structure (D.M. Huang, D. Chandler, private communication). A second issue is the indirect effects of solute-solvent interactions in establishing structures and switching between structures as was initially anticipated (233). That switching can be sensitive to details of van der Waals attractive interactions (163, 239–241; G. Hummer, J.C. Rasaiah, J. Noworyta, private communication).
It is worthwhile attempting to articulate a down-to-earth view of the claims of Reference (233) speciﬁcally. For biomolecules, there likely are uncommon

transitional structures and conditions for which localized water occupancies can change abruptly. As these transitional structures become identiﬁed, they will be interesting. Considering water-hydrocarbon liquid interfaces not compromised by hydrophilic contacts, it is likely that these interfacial regions will be looser than adjoining bulk phases and more accomodating to imposition of hydrophobic species (145). Surfactants probably change that conclusion qualitatively (145). This is likely to be relevant to protein hydration and function. Most solute conﬁgurations, except for a few transitional structures, won’t require speciﬁc acknowledgment of drying. The claims to Reference (233) don’t seem to require modiﬁcation of the discussion above, “Potentials of the Mean Forces Among Primitive Hydrophobic Species in Water,” that separated contact from noncontact conﬁgurations and entropy effects from the rest, and then suggested that the more poorly understood noncontact questions are likely to show the most variability. The speciﬁc claims of Reference (233) and the general issues remain questions for research.
CONCLUDING DISCUSSION
This review has adopted a narrow theoretical focus and a direct style with the goal of identifying primitive conclusions that might assist in next stages of molecular research on these problems. These theory and modeling topics haven’t been reviewed with this goal recently, and a review of the bigger topic of hydrophobic effects would not be feasible in this setting. More comprehensive and formal reviews of these topics are in progress and that must be my excuse for considering such a small subset of the work in this area. Nevertheless, some historical perspective is necessary in identifying valuable primitive conclusions.
One such conclusion is the rectiﬁcation of the antique Pratt-Chandler theory (1–16). This was an unexpected development because the advances reviewed above had bypassed stock integral equation theories. It may have been the stock aspect of the earlier approach (17) that caused the greatest confusion on this topic. There is no obvious point to doing that type of integral equation approximation again for the more complex solutes to which the theoretical interest has progressed. For the problems addressed, however, this amended Pratt-Chandler theory is now seen to be a compelling, approximate theory with empirical ingredients. The research noted above, “Theory of Interface Formation” and “Importance Sampling to Correct Occupanices,” emphasizes that the treatment of those attractive force effects on the hydration problem by the Pratt-Chandler theory was less satisfactory than that of the scaled particle models.
Another primitive conclusion is that the scaled-particle models (135, 138) have been the most valuable theories for primitive hydrophobic effects. This is due to the quantitative focus of those models, which permitted more incisive analyses (12–15, 135, 139, 140) in contrast to pictorial theories. Those analyses have lead

to signiﬁcant advances in our understanding of these problems. The connection from scaled-particle models, to Mayer-Montroll series (10, 158), the potential distribution theorem (3, 159), and the quasichemical approach (11, 19–23) identify a promising line for further molecular theoretical progress on these problems. Comparing Equations 4 and 5, the amended Pratt-Chandler theory is most appropriately viewed as a quasichemical theory. The anticipated theoretical progress will treat more thoroughly the effects of changes in temperature, pressure, and composition of the solution, including salt effects, and will treat neglected context hydrophobicity (195) in detail. That work will study cold denaturation and chemical denaturation in molecular detail and will begin to discriminate hydrophobic effects in the cores of soluble proteins from hydrophobic effects in membranes and micelles. That work will begin to consider hydrophobic effects in nanotechnology with molecular speciﬁcity.
A natural explanation of thermodynamic signatures of hydrophobic hydration, particularly entropy convergence, emerges from these theoretical advances. How those temperature behaviors are involved in cold denaturation or the stability of thermophilic proteins will be a topic for future research.
Much has been made of the Gaussian character of results such as Figure 2. The observation (1) best supporting this view can be explained as a cancellation of approximation errors (23); slight inaccuracies of a Percus-Yevick (Gaussian) approximation are balanced by neglect of incipient interface formation for atomic sized solutes. In a number of other cases where these distributions have been investigated carefully, simple parabolic models of results such as Figure 2 are less accurate for thermodynamic properties and not only because of the inﬂuence of a second thermodynamic phase nearby. Nevertheless, quadratic models provide convenient, reasonable starting points for these analyses.
A ﬁnal conclusion regards the better discrimination of contact and noncontact hydrophobic interactions. The contact hydrophobic interactions express the classic picture of entropy dominance at lower temperatures. The noncontact interactions have more variability and are likely to be involved in more unusual effects such as pressure denaturation where a historical picture of hydrophobicity had been paradoxical.
