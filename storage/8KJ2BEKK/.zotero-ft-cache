Abstract

25

26

Hydrophobic nanopores provide a model system to study hydrophobic interactions at

27

28

the nanoscale. Such nanopores could also function as a valve since they halt the

29 30

transport of water and all dissolved species. It has recently been found that a

31

hydrophobic pore can become wetted i.e. filled with condensed water or aqueous

32

33

solution of salt when a sufficiently high electric field is applied across the membrane.

34

35

The wetting process is reversible thus when the voltage is lowered or switched off, the

36 37

pore comes back to a closed state due to water evaporation in the pore. In this

38 39

manuscript we present experimental studies on how the switching between conducting

40

and non-conducting states can be regulated by the electrolyte concentration. Transport

41

42

properties of single nanopores modified with alkyl chains of different lengths were

43

44

recorded in salt concentrations between 10 mM and 1 M KCl. Nanopores modified with

45 46

propyl chains exhibited gating in 10 mM KCl and were open for ionic transport for all

47

voltages at higher salt concentrations. Nanopores modified with decyl chains did not

48

49

conduct current in 10 mM and exhibited repeatable hydrophobic gating in 100 mM and

50

51

1 M KCl. The results are explained in the context of Maxwell stress in confined

52 53

geometry with local surface charges, which change the shape of the water/vapor

54

interface and promote wetting.

Introduction

5

6

There has been a lot of interest in creating nanoporous structures which, similar to

7 8

biological channels in a cell membrane, could regulate water, ionic, and molecular

9 10

transport.1-6 Control of transport by hydrophobic interactions is especially interesting,

11

since a hydrophobic nanopore provides means to regulate the transport of water and

12

13

therefore any species which is dissolved in it. Water and ions permeate such a pore

14

15

only if sufficiently high external stimulus, e.g. pressure difference, is applied. Moreover,

16 17

hydrophobic interactions at the nanoscale make the system reversible so that when the

18

stimulus is removed water in a hydrophobic nanopore undergoes spontaneous

19

20

evaporation halting all transmembrane transport. Hydrophobic systems could therefore

21

22

become the basis for on-demand drug delivery systems, nonlinear circuits, and

23 24

biosensors.3

25

26

A great deal of research has been done on understanding sorption/desorption of water

27 28

in nanopores and on hydrophobic surfaces as a function of applied pressure.7,8,9 An

29 30

existence of hysteresis was found such that the pressure needed to cause sorption of

31 32

water, leading to pore wetting, is higher than the pressure needed to cause

33

desorption.1,7,9 This observation is in agreement with the hysteresis of a contact angle

34

35

i.e. the advancing angle is larger than the receding angle.10 Experimental and modeling

36

37

studies also showed that with the increase of surface hydrophobicity, seen as the

38 39

increase of contact angle, the sorption pressure increases leading to widening of the

40

hysteresis.7

41

42

43

When the pore opening approaches truly nanometer dimensions, the pressures

44 45

required to wet a hydrophobic pore become very high thus making such pressure-driven

46

systems very difficult to build and operate.1,11 High electric fields on the other hand can

47

48

be applied across membranes without the necessity of mechanically strengthening the

49

50

system. Electric fields were indeed found to open hydrophobic pores for water and ionic

51 52

transport.11,12,13 Electric field induced transition of wetting/dewetting is typically

53 54

examined in a form of current-voltage curves. When a pore or its section is filled with

55

vapor no measurable ionic transport is observed2 or the pore ionic conductance is

56

57

orders of magnitude lower compared to the case when the pore is filled with condensed

water.4 A sufficiently high magnitude of voltage is needed to push the solution into the

5

pore, which is observed as a sharp increase of the transmembrane current. Subsequent

6

7

lowering of the applied electric field leads to pore closure interpreted as water

8

9

evaporation. Interestingly, hysteresis known for pressure driven systems is also

10 11

prominent in electric field induced wetting: voltage needed to open a pore for ionic

12

transport is higher than the voltage at which evaporation occurs.1,2,4

13

14

15

Several mechanisms were suggested for the electric field induced wetting.

16 17

Electrostriction, i.e. electric field induced increase of water density, was theoretically

18

predicted to occur in hydrophobic nanopores and lead to water infiltration.14,15,16

19

20

Although bulk water is characterized by low compressibility, diminished density of water

21 22

close to hydrophobic surfaces17 make it prone to electrostriction. Electrowetting, the

23 24

electric field induced lowering of the contact angle, was suggested as another

25

mechanism for wetting of low aspect ratio silicon nitride pores.4 Wetting of hydrophobic

26

27

nanopores can also be facilitated by water polarizability and the natural tendency of a

28

29

polar medium to move into zones with high electric fields.

30

31 32

Although wetting of hydrophobic pores by electric field is experimentally achieved using

33

electrolytes and not pure water, the importance of ions for wetting and dewetting

34

35

processes is not always taken into account or discussed. A set of experiments and

36

37

calculations performed by Smirnov suggested ionic concentrations had very little

38 39

influence on the process of wetting of hydrophobic nanopores.4 Concentration and ion

40

type is however known to be important for hydrophobic interactions as evidenced by

41

42

experimental studies on the effect of salt on non-polar solutes’ solubility.18-22 Small ions

43

44

with high charge density were shown to decrease the solute’ solubility; the effect of

45 46

larger ions was the opposite, the presence of salt diminished hydrophobic interactions

47 48

between solutes. Molecular dynamics simulations by Lu et al. revealed that higher

49

pressures would need to be applied to infiltrate a molecular-sized nanopore with a salt

50

51

solution compared to pressures needed to wet the pore with pure water.23 Presence of

52 53

ions in a pore was found to promote dewetting in another molecular dynamics study.24

54 55

An opposite effect was reported as well: presence of ionic concentration gradient was

In this manuscript we present experimental results on the effect of salt concentration on

9 10

hydrophobic gating in single polymer nanopores whose pore walls were modified with

11

alkyl chains of different lengths. Planar surfaces subjected to the same modification as

12

13

single nanopores showed contact angle below 90 ºC, suggesting the surfaces contained

14

15

regions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. Nanopores modified with propyl and

16 17

hexyl chains could be opened for ionic transport at lower KCl concentrations compared

18

to nanopores modified with decyl molecules. All pores which showed hydrophobic

19

20

gating exhibited modification-independent closed state of less than 5 pA

21

22

transmembrane current. The results are explained in the context of Maxwell stress and

23 24

osmotic pressure induced outward stress, which change the shape of the liquid/vapor

25 26

interface in a salt concentration dependent fashion. We use the model developed by

27

Lee and Kang for a lipid/gas interface present in a nanoslit created by two charged

28

29

parallel plates.25

Experimental Methods

35

36

Preparation of nanopores: All nanopores used in the presented experiments were

37

38

prepared in 12 µm thick films of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by the track-etching

39

40

technique. 26 The films were first irradiated with single energetic heavy ions at the linear

41 42

accelerator UNILAC at the Institute for Heavy Ions Research in Darmstadt, Germany.27

43 44

The irradiated films were subjected to etching in 9 M NaOH from one side while the

45

other side of the film was in contact with an acidic stopping medium. This asymmetric

46

47

etching procedure is known to lead to preparation of conically shaped nanopores. 28 The

48

49

PET nanopores used in this study had the small opening, the tip, between 5 and 12 nm,

50 51

and the large opening, called the base, between 300 and 700 nm.

52

53

Chemical modification of PET nanopores: Etching of irradiated PET films in NaOH leads

54 55

to preparation of pores whose walls contain carboxyl groups at the density of 1 per nm2.

56 57

These groups provide a convenient route to the attachment of hydrophobic groups to

the walls using the coupling agent (N - (3 - Dimethylaminopropyl) - N′-ethylcarbodiimide

5

hydrochloride) (EDC). We used propylamine, hexylamine and decylamine whose amine

6

7

groups were linked with carboxyls on the pore walls creating an amide bond. The two-

8 9

step procedure described by Ali et al was used.29 The first step entails 60 min

10 11

incubation of both sides of a membrane in an ethanol solution of 0.1 M EDC and 0.2 M

12

pentafluorophenol (PFP). The pore was washed carefully with ethanol and in the

13

14

second step the membrane was incubated with 50 mM propylamine (or hexylamine or

15

16

decylamine) for 2 hours. After the modification, the pores were carefully washed again

17 18

with ethanol and subsequently water.

19

20

Recordings of ion current: Single pore membranes were examined using the same

21

22

conductivity cell in which the etching was performed. Current-voltage curves were

23 24

recorded using two non-polarizable Ag/AgCl electrodes and a 6487 Keithley

25 26

picoammeter voltage source. The voltage was cycled in the range between -10 V and

27

+10 V in the forward and reversed directions to observe hysteresis. Voltage was

28

29

changed stepwise and to avoid capacitance effects, each voltage step was held for at

30

31

least 3 s after which a current value was recorded. Multiple scans allowed calculating

32 33

average values of the current with standard deviation. A few pores were also examined

34

using 200B Axopatch and 1322A Digidata (Molecular Devices, Inc.). Ion current signal

35

36

was recorded at each voltage step for 30 s. Current-voltage curves were obtaining by

37

38

time averaging of the signals. 10 mM, 0.1 M, and 1 M KCl solutions were buffered to pH

39 40

8 with Tris buffer.

through three sub-10 nm PET pores modified with propylamine, hexylamine and

decylamine, respectively. The chemical modifications were achieved by linking the

amines with carboxyl groups on the pore walls using EDC-mediated chemistry.29,30 The

values were similar in water and KCl concentrations in the range between 10 mM and 1

5

M (not shown). Contact angle is a macroscopic measurement, which predicted only

6

7

insignificant differences between the three surfaces. All three modifications led to an

8

9

increased contact angle compared to unmodified PET but measured values below 90º

10 11

suggest the surfaces consisted of hydrophobic and hydrophilic islands. The presence of

12

unreacted carboxyl groups is also evidenced by the ion current rectification modified

13

14

pores exhibited, especially pronounced in 100 mM KCl (Fig. 1). Rectification in conically

15

16

shaped nanopores can be observed only if the pore walls contain excess surface

17 18

charge.28-38 The direction of rectification after the hydrophobic modification is the same

19

as before the amine attachment pointing to the presence of residual negative charges.33

20

21

These observations are also in agreement with previous reports on the difficulty in

22

23

achieving complete conversion of surface carboxyls groups using EDC coupling.39,40

24

25 26

Although the contact angle of surfaces modified with propyl, hexyl and decylamine was

27

very similar, current-voltage curves of nanopores with the same modifications were

28

29

different from each other. All pores shown in Fig. 1 exhibited hydrophobic gating i.e.

30

31

voltage induced switching between non-conducting and conducting states, however the

32 33

salt concentration and voltage range at which it occurred differed between the three

34

types of pores. The propylamine modified pore showed very low conductance and a

35

36

weak gating in 10 mM KCl (Fig. 1a): the pore switched between a closed state with

37

38

currents below 5 pA and a weakly conducting state of just tens of pA. When increasing

39 40

the salt concentration to 100 mM KCl, the pore became conductive for ions at all

41

examined voltages, and in 1 M KCl, the measured currents were quantitatively very

42

43

similar to values before the chemical modification. When lowering the salt concentration

44

45

down to 10 mM KCl, the pore remained conductive, and only subsequent air drying of

46

47

the sample closed it for ionic transport. Similar behavior was observed with another

48 49

independently prepared nanopore modified with propylamine (Fig. S1). Hexylamine

50

modified nanopores remained mostly non-conductive in 10 mM KCl with similar values

51

52

of the current as for the propylamine nanopore (Fig. 1b, Fig. S2). In 100 mM KCl the

53

54

pores switched between non-conducting and conducting states but eventually became

55 56

conductive for ions at all voltages. No gating was observed in 1 M KCl. The hexylamine

for voltages of ~4V, and exhibited repeatable switching between conductive and non-

8

9

mention that the recordings in 100 mM KCl were taken before the data in 1 M KCl and

10 11

10 mM; this pore was therefore able to undergo dewetting by lowering ionic

12

concentration. The non-conducting state of all hydrophobic devices is attributed to a

13

pore containing at least one vapor pocket, which interrupts water and ionic flow.

We would like to emphasize two unique observations with the decylamine modified

22 23

nanopore in 1 M KCl (Fig. 1c). The first striking feature was the ability of the pore to

24

reversibly switch between a closed state with currents below 5 pA, and high

25

26

conductance states of a few nA. This pore also exhibited a well-defined hysteresis such

27

28

that voltages required to open the pore for ionic transport (Vopen) were higher than

29 30

voltages at which the pore stopped conducting (Vclosed). The hysteresis was present for

31 32

both voltage polarities. Similar observations were recorded with two other nanopores

33

modified with decylamine in the same conditions as the 9 nm pore shown in Fig. 1c. In

34

35

order to facilitate comparison of the effect of hydrophobic gating observed with different

36

37

pores, we summarized the voltage scans by noting the values of voltage Vopen and

38 39

Vclosed. The results for three pores are summarized in Figure 2. The reproducibility of the

40 41

values of Vclosed and Vopen is especially clear for the pore shown in Fig. 2c, which

42

repeatedly opened and closed for 30 cycles between -5 V and +5 V and an additional

43

44

20 cycles in the scans (-4 V, +4 V) (not shown).

Our experiments on nanopores modified with three types of alkyl chains point to the

5

conclusion that higher KCl concentrations promote wetting of the pores. The results are

6

7

in agreement with experimental and theoretical studies showing that added salts can

8

9

modulate the strength of hydrogen interactions between water molecules as well as

10 11

hydrophobic interactions.18-22 The experimental results also suggest that repeatable

12

gating between conducting and non-conducting states is facilitated by the attachment of

13

14

a longer alkyl chain to the pore walls (Fig. 1). Even though the three modifications

15

16

produced surfaces of similar contact angle, nanopores modified with the three

17 18

molecules exhibited different transport properties and KCl concentration dependence.

19

20

Another important point to note is that even nanopores modified with propylamine were

21

22

able to form a closed state with a very small conductance of just a few of pA for few

23 24

volts. An ability to achieve a completely closed state with modest hydrophobic

25 26

modifications is in agreement with molecular dynamics modeling performed with

27

surfaces containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches.41,42,43 The modeling revealed

28

29

that a patch as small as 2 nm is sufficient to induce water evaporation.

30

31 32

This observation is however in disagreement with an earlier experimental report on

33

hydrophobic gating in chemically modified silicon nitride pores with much large opening

34

35

diameter of ~100 nm. These pores also switched between closed and open states

36

37

however conductance of the pores in the closed state was dependent on the type of

38 39

hydrophobic modification: the closed state resistance was lower for less hydrophobic

40

modifications.4 Existence of the finite conductance for all voltages was explained by the

41

42

presence of a water layer at the pore walls and the assumption that the pore was never

43 44

completely dry. 44 There could be at least two reasons why our hydrophobic nanopores

45 46

had a closed state with almost zero currents for all chemical modifications. (i) The

47 48

polymer pores studied in this report are characterized by a high aspect ratio thus the

49

residual surface conductance might produce currents less than 10 pA even at voltages

50

51

of few volts. (ii) Another possibility could be the truly nanometer scale of the polymer

52

53

nanopores; water density close to hydrophobic surfaces might indeed be too low to

54 55

allow ions to be present close the surface.

A starting point to considering the effect of voltage and salt concentration on transport

5

properties of our nanopores is with equations that have previously been used to explain

6

7

hydrophobic gating in nanopores. Vlassiouk et al. considered electrostatic pressure that

8

9

arises from the electrostatic energy of a capacitor created by two water menisci across

10 11

a vapor pocket: 4

The critical pressure needed to force influx of water into a pore whose walls are

17

18

characterized by a contact angle of θ can be estimated from the macroscopic

25 26

where D is the opening diameter of the pore, and γ is surface tension of water.

27

28

As mentioned above, we assume walls of our alkyl modified pores consist of

29

30

hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches. Hydrophobic gating occurs due to the presence of

31 32

the hydrophobic zones, whose contact angle can be approximated by the value

33

obtained with C10 thiols chemisorbed on a gold layer; 45 the contact angle was

34

35

measured 113º. Thus, the calculated critical electric field necessary to open a 10 nm in

36 37

diameter pore is equal to ~1.6 109 V/m. Our pores have hydrophobic and hydrophilic

38

39

zones, thus the closed state of the device will not correspond to the whole 12 µm pore

40 41

length filled with vapor. Instead, the pore will contain alternating vapor and condensed

42

pockets. If we assume there is only one vapor pocket that is 20 nm long, the voltage

43

44

needed to wet the pore is ~30 V, a much higher value than measured experimentally. If

45

46

there are multiple vapor pockets the required voltage would be even higher.

47

48

As the next step, we considered a model developed by Dzubiella and Hansen13 that

49

50

also predicted an existence of a critical electric field needed to fill a hydrophobic

51

52

nanopore with water. The proposed relationship for the free energy difference between

53 54

filled and empty states of a nanopore contained the electrostatic energy difference term;

55

different permittivities of confined water and its vapor were assumed. The critical electric

56

57

field was calculated for the case when the free energy difference became zero. Using

similar parameters as these above in eq. (1) and the presence of just one 20 nm long

5

vapor pocket, the derived equation (eq. (9) in ref. [13]) predicted a value of required

6

7

voltage of ~20 V.

8

9 10

Vlassiouk et al. considered electrowetting as the mechanism for voltage-dependent

11

opening of their pores.4 We cannot apply this approach, because our closed state in low

12

13

voltages and/or KCl concentrations does not have finite ionic conductance. Thus, the

14

15

pore walls in contact with the vapor pocket might not be wet i.e. the two reservoirs on

16 17

both sides of the pocket are not electrically connected (Fig. 3).

18

19

In order to explain the observed dependence of the wetting process on KCl

20

21

concentration and applied voltage, we will focus on the residual surface charges on the

22 23

nanopore walls. Let’s consider a nanopore with one vapor pocket flanked by two

24

regions filled with a salt solution (Fig. 3). We will look closely at the outward stress

25

26

components acting on a surface perpendicular to the pore axis with a focus on the

27

28

liquid/gas interface. This situation without an externally applied field can be qualitatively

29 30

described by a model developed for a similar interface present in a nanoslit created by

31 32

two charged parallel plates separated by a distance of few nm.25 The electric potential

33

on the plates/pore walls induces ionic selectivity thus the regions with salt solution will

34

35

be predominantly filled with counterions. Local concentration of ions and electric

36

37

potential can be then described by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Radial profile of

38 39

electric potential leads to non-homogeneous electric field, E(r).

40

41

In the absence of fluid flow and gravity effects, the magnitude of the total stress, Tz, on

42

43

a surface in an electrolyte perpendicular to the slit axis is given by the sum of the

44 45

osmotic pressure contribution, π, and the Maxwell stress contribution:25

This electromechanical approach to wetting has been applied before when considering

electrowetting phenomena with conducting liquids and surfaces.46 The osmotic pressure

53 54

can be calculated via free charge density nf in a solution (difference between

55 56

Under the assumption that no osmotic pressure exists in the vapor phase and that the

5

electric permittivity of the gas phase is much lower than that of the salt solution, one can

6

7

consider only the electrolyte contribution to the outward stress. Due to radial

8

9

inhomogeneity of the electric field originating from the charged walls, the total outward

10 11

stress in the z direction, Tz, is a function of r and assumes maximum values close to the

12 13

walls (Fig. 3). At the liquid/gas interface the presence of Tz leads to

14

electrocapillarity.25,46,47 It is important to note that only the stress exerted on a surface

15

16

perpendicular to the pore axis is spatially inhomogeneous. As shown before, the normal

17 18

stress exerted on a surface parallel to the slit axis is constant across the slit width and

19

equal to the osmotic pressure at the centerline of the slit.10

20

21

22

In the case of two parallel plates distant by 2h and a limit of low surface potentials, the

23 24

following analytical formula was derived for the magnitude of the outward pressure in

25

the z-direction:25

44 45

Tz as predicted from eqs. (4) for T=293 K, h=3nm, and σ = 0.02 C/m2 is shown in Figure

47

48

have indeed been created. Equation (4) also predicts an increase of the outward stress

49

50

magnitude with the increase of salt concentration. The shape of liquid/gas interface is

51 52

therefore modulated by the salt concentration, which explains our experimental

53

observation that some nanopores became conductive to ions by a mere increase of KCl

concentration in the bulk electrolyte (Fig. 1a).

35

Adding external voltage is expected to further increase the outward stress, which will

36 37

change the shape and position of the liquid/vapor interface, and eventually lead to pore

38 39

wetting. Our data suggest that pores modified with the longest studied here alkyl chain

40

C10 require both increase of KCl concentration and applied voltage to change the

41

42

shape of the liquid/vapor interface and cause wetting.

43

44 45

The case of cylindrical geometry, which would be a better model for the experimental

46

system considered here, is more complicated, and we will include it in future work.

47

48

49

According to the mechanism discussed above, presence of residual surface charges is

50 51

crucial for the observed salt concentration dependent wetting. SiN pores considered by

52

Vlassiouk et al. were characterized with contact angles over 100º and most probably did

53

54

not contain residual surface charges.4 As a result, Maxwell stress in their system did not

55

56

contribute to the wetting process, and no salt concentration dependence of wetting was

57 58

observed.

We also would like to mention another mechanism which could contribute to the

7 8

observed salt dependence of hydrophobic gating; this mechanism is not related with the

9 10

presence of residual charges on the pore walls. Due to the large aspect ratio of

11

considered pores, the so-called access resistance present at pore entrances is typically

12

13

not taken into account. 48 It is possible however that this additional resistance element

14

15

could modulate the electric field across vapor pockets. Access resistance increases with

16 17

the decrease of salt concentration thus in more diluted solutions a larger portion of the

18

applied voltage will drop at the pore entrance; as a result, the electric field across vapor

19

20

pocket(s) in a nanopore will be lower. We believe however this mechanism does not

21

22

dominate in our system since no systematic dependence of the threshold voltage

23 24

needed to wet a nanopore on pore opening diameters was found.

Conclusions

30

31

In this manuscript we present experimental results on transport properties of nanopores

32

33

that underwent modest hydrophobic modifications by the attachment of C3, C6 and C10

34 35

alkyl chains. Although planar surfaces modified according to the same procedures

36

showed similar values of contact angle, nanopores with the shortest alkyl chains

37

38

exhibited the weakest hydrophobic gating and could be opened for ionic transport

39

40

already in 10 mM KCl. C10 modified nanopores were mostly closed for ionic transport in

41 42

10 mM, but conducted current for voltages above a threshold value in 0.1 M and 1 M

43 44

KCl; these pores also featured repeatable voltage-induced transitions between

45

conductive and non-conductive states.

46

47 48

Our experiments indicate that modestly hydrophobic nanopores containing hydrophobic

49 50

and hydrophilic regions on the pore walls exhibit not only voltage but also KCl

51

concentration dependent transport properties. The effect of salt was described by the

52

53

outward stress component originating from Maxwell stress and osmotic pressure that

54

55

lead to electrocapillary effect. As a result, the shape of liquid/vapor interface in a

56 57

charged nanopore is modulated by the presence of local electric fields. The data and

the model indicate that contact angle measurement might not be a good predictor of

5

behavior of nanopores at the nanoscale especially for heterogeneous surfaces.

6

7 8

The presented system of nanopores with hydrophobic islands is obtained only when the

9 10

surface modification of existing surface charges of the pore walls is not complete. The

11

EDC mediated chemistry of linking amines to carboxyls indeed does not lead to the

12

13

complete conversion of the surface groups.39,40 When using another type of chemical

14

15

modification, one will have to tune the time of the chemical reaction as well as

16 17

concentration of reagents to assure partial surface modification. This approach was

18

used before when modifying PET pores with (trimethylsilyl) diazomethane.2

19

20

21

Finally, it is indeed surprising that nanopores with opening diameters as large as 10 nm

22 23

exhibit hydrophobic gating. Such wide structures were shown before to exhibit a large

24

kinetic barrier for water evaporation, which would prevent the dewetting process to

25

26

occur.11,15,16,49,50 The results presented here are however in agreement with other

27

28

experimental reports showing switching between conducting and non-conducting states

29 30

even with pores having openings of ~100 nm.4 It was suggested that presence of

31 32

residual gases might favor the process of dewetting.1 We would also like to point to the

33

possibility that flexible polymer chains, which are known to line PET pores, 51 can

34

35

facilitate dewetting as well. According to the model presented in ref [52] hydrophobic

36

37

nanopores whose pore walls can “breathe” favor evaporation; more rigid structures

38 39

favor water condensation and wetting. This hypothesis could be tested by experimental

40

studies performed with rigid nanopores fabricated e.g. in SiN.

41

42

43

Nanopores which exhibit repeatable opening and closing with voltage could become the

44 45

basis for drug-delivery systems and ionic circuits. The majority of nanopore based

46

devices focus on controlling transport of ions and molecules.34 Hydrophobic interactions

47

48

and hydrophobic gating open a route for preparation of more complete valves which can

49 50

regulate transport of water and all species that are dissolved in it.3
