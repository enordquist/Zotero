ABSTRACT: The nonselective cation channel TRPV1 is responsible for transducing noxious stimuli into action potentials propagating through peripheral nerves. It is activated by temperatures greater than 43 °C, while remaining completely nonconductive at temperatures lower than this threshold. The origin of this sharp response, which makes TRPV1 a biological temperature sensor, is not understood. Here we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to characterize the molecular determinants of the transition between nonconductive and conductive states. We found that hydration of the pore and thus ion permeation depends critically on the polar character of its molecular surface: in this narrow hydrophobic enclosure, the motion of a polar side-chain is suﬃcient to stabilize either the dry or wet state. The conformation of this side-chain is in turn coupled to the hydration state of four peripheral cavities, which undergo a dewetting transition at the activation temperature.

T RPV1 is an ion channel mostly expressed in the peripheral nervous system.1,2 Upon activation, it generates the signal that, transmitted to the thalamus through the dorsal root ganglia, is perceived as a painful sensation.3 This makes it an attractive pharmacological target to silence pain pathways.4,5 However,the TRPV1 mechanism of activation and, in particular, its ability to sense temperature remains largely unexplained.6−15
Recent cryo-EM studies have revealed that TRPV1 is a tetrameric assembly with a transmembrane (TM) domain closely resembling that of voltage-gated ion channels:16−18 it is composed of two main moduli: the S1−S4 domain and the pore domain connected through the S4−S5 linker. The pore domain contains the pathway for ions and is composed of the S5 and S6 helices from all four subunits.
Structures of TRPV1 resolved in diﬀerent conformational states provided signiﬁcant insight into its gating transitions.16−18 It was shown that TRPV1 has two gates, upper and lower, located at the level of the selectivity ﬁlter (G643M644) and of the S6 bundle crossing (I679), respectively. Both gates can be open (resiniferatoxin-bound or RTX-bound state) or closed (apo state); a particularly intriguing case is that of the capsaicin-bound (CAP-bound) state, in which the upper gate is closed, while the lower gate is partially dilated. Another interesting aspect of the CAP-bound state concerns its functional properties: it has been shown that the CAP-bound state is closed at low temperature, it has a 50% probability of opening at room temperature and it is completely open at high temperature.19 While the microscopic determinants of this progressive activation are key to understand temperature sensing, it is still unclear how the channel transitions from the CAP-bound state to a conductive one.

We thus started by examining the diﬀerences between the three TRPV1 cryo-EM structures (apo, RTX-bound and CAPbound). We aligned the S1−S4 domains, which do not undergo signiﬁcant conformational rearrangements during gating, and compared the superimposed pore domains. Surprisingly, even though the CAP-bound state is putatively an intermediate state, we found it to be distinct from the other two, i.e., it diﬀers from the apo and RTX-bound states more than the latter two diﬀer from each other. Unlike the apo and RTX-bound conformations, in the CAP-bound one the S6 C-terminus moves away from the S4−S5 linker, indicating that these two elements are not physically in contact as they usually are in ion channels of the 6TM family (Figure 1a). This observation implies that TRPV1 opening occurs in two steps: uncoupling and recoupling of the S6 C-terminus and the S4−S5 linker. Based on the experimental data,19 we speculate that the ﬁrst step occurs already at low temperatures and hence it should be temperature-independent, while the second one is modulated by heat.
Partial detaching of the S6 C-terminus from the S4−S5 linker can result in the formation of small cavities between these two elements. Indeed, using a well-established method to detect voids and pockets in proteins (f-pocket20), in the CAP-bound state we found four cavities (one per channel subunit) hereafter referred to as peripheral cavities or PCs. These cavities are connected to the intracellular solution and run parallel to the central pore up to the middle of S6 (Figure 1b). Notably, in the

Note that in the ﬁrst case, in addition to the free energy barrier at the level of the lower gate, there is one at the level of the central cavity (∼3.2 kcal/mol). It is created by four Y671 residues, which are oriented perpendicular to the pore and create a constriction.22 In the channel with hydrated PCs, however, Y671 adopts another conformation: these residues “open up” and become oriented parallel to the pore axis.22 As a result, free energy barrier at the level of the central cavity disappears. Extra, SF, cavity, g, and intra denote the extracellular solution, selectivity ﬁlter, central cavity, lower gate and intracellular solution, respectively.

apo and RTX-bound states, homologous cavities are signiﬁcantly smaller and not connected to the intracellular solution.
The presence of four PCs, accessible to the intracellular solution, made us hypothesize that these can host water molecules. Therefore, in modeling the initial conﬁguration for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we ﬁlled these cavities with several water molecules (from 4 to 6) and considered a system with empty PCs as a control case. For each of them, a trajectory of 0.75 μs was generated (see SI Methods). Note that during these runs the PCs remained either hydrated if they were initially ﬁlled with water or dehydrated if they were initialized empty, suggesting that the channel admits two metastable states.
We thus analyzed the conformational rearrangements of the pore domain along the MD trajectories using, as reference, the three cryo-EM structures (apo, RTX-bound and CAP-bound). Figures S1 and 1c shows that the channel with hydrated PCs ﬂuctuates in the region surrounding its initial structure, i.e., the

CAP-bound state. Interestingly, the system in which the PCs remain empty drifts away from the CAP-bound state, and in particular, two out of four subunits converge to the RTX-bound state.
Encouraged by these observations, we asked whether the ﬁnal conﬁgurations reached by the simulations with empty and hydrated PCs were, in fact, conductive and nonconductive states, respectively. Thus, we characterized the average radius and hydration proﬁles of the central pore for the two MD runs (Figure 2a and S2). We found that the proﬁles of the pore radius were qualitatively similar: the pore radius at the selectivity ﬁlter was ∼1.5 and 1.1 Å for the channels with empty and hydrated PCs, respectively; that at the lower gate was 1.7 and 1.4 Å. By contrast, the two hydration proﬁles were drastically diﬀerent: in the channel with hydrated PCs, we observed two hydrophobic gaps at the upper and lower gates, indicating that this state is nonconductive; however, in the other case, the central pore was completely hydrated,

suggesting that the two gates are open. Importantly, in both the hydrated and the nonhydrated conformations, the pore size was smaller than the critical radius required to continuously hydrate hydrophobic cylindrical pores.21
Finally, for the two channel conformations, we estimated the free energy proﬁle for permeation of a sodium ion using metadynamics23 (Figure 2b; see also Figure S3a and S3b for the analysis of convergence). In the channel with hydrated PCs, we found a large free energy barrier, greater than 12 kcal/mol, at the level of the lower gate, conﬁrming our hypothesis that this state is nonconductive. In the other conformation, however, the corresponding barrier was more than twice smaller (5.2 kcal/ mol in the direction from extra- to intracellular solution), suggesting that emptying the PCs resulted in a conductive state.
Based on our analysis, we conclude that while the hydration of the PCs stabilized the closed state of the channel, their dehydration resulted in partial opening: two channel subunits have converged to the RTX-bound state, and the free energy barrier for a sodium ion permeation is only ∼2 kcal/mol larger than that in the fully open state.24,25 For the sake of clarity, hereafter we will refer to the nonconductive and conductive conformations as closed and open, respectively.
What is then the major structural diﬀerence between the closed and open states? We noticed that one important diﬀerence is the conformation of a polar N676 (Figure 3a). When the channel is closed, N676 is exposed to the PCs, where it forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the resident water molecules, while the region of the central pore proximal to it is

dehydrated. In the open state, instead, N676 faces the central pore, which is hydrated throughout its length and the PCs are devoid of waters; in the absence of N676, the residues lining the PCs are mostly hydrophobic (Figure S4a and S4b), and, rather than containing water, these cavities accommodate the side chains of M682, an amino acid that is located just two helix turns away from N676.
Another signiﬁcant diﬀerence is the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of residues lining the central pore (Figure S5 and 3b): for several hydrophobic residues (L674, L675, L678, and also Y671) this area is smaller in the open state, while for N676 it is larger, indicating that, the open pore is more hydrophilic than the closed one. Considering the similarity of the pore radius proﬁles in the closed and open states (Figure 2a), this result suggests that rather than the shape, what changes in the pore upon activation is the polar character of its surface.
The intriguing aspect of this observation is that the solvation free energy of hydrophobic moieties is known to show a nontrivial dependence on temperature. Is the transition from closed to open pore also temperature dependent? To test this hypothesis, we estimated the free energy proﬁle of the N676 reorientation at room (300 K), high (340 K) and, as a control, low (280 K) temperature using metadynamics23 (Figure 4a; see also Figures S6a,b and S7 for the deﬁnition of the collective variable and the analysis of convergence, respectively). Starting from the closed state, we performed 400 ns of metadynamics simulations at each temperature and sampled several transitions of N676 between the two conformations.

Letter

In all three free energy proﬁles (Figure 4a), the state in which

N676 is located inside the PC corresponds to the global

minimum. However, at 340 K another free energy minimum

appears corresponding to N676 facing the central pore. The

diﬀerence between the two states does not exceed 1 kcal/mol

and the barrier separating them is only 1.5 kcal/mol, suggesting

that the two channel conformations are both signiﬁcantly

populated and in fast exchange. Importantly, the free energy

proﬁles along an order parameter reporting the hydration of the

adjacent PC shows that at 340 K the channel states with a

hydrated and dehydrated PC coexist, while at 300 and 280 K

the hydrated state is predominant. In summary, at 300 and 280

K the PC is ﬁlled with water, whereas at 340 K the PC

experiences large amplitude water density ﬂuctuations.

We also monitored the hydration of the central pore along

the metadynamics runs, as this degree of freedom has a clear

connection with ion conductance (Figure 4b). We found that in

all three simulations, water molecules can transiently occupy

the central cavity. However, only at 340 K, they can penetrate

as deep as the lower gate. The hydration of this compartment

was signiﬁcantly increased at high temperature compared to

room and low, even though in a ﬂuctuating transient fashion.

At 340 K, the rotation of N676 is correlated with the

hydration of the PC: if the PC is empty, then N676 points

toward the pore; conversely, if the PC is hydrated, then N676

points outward, facing the PC (Figure S8). Moreover, the

hydration of the pore is strongly correlated with the rotation of

N676; as a result, the pore is empty if N676 points outward,

while it becomes hydrated whenever N676 rotates toward the

pore (Figure S9). Overall, the hydration of the PC, the rotation

of N676, and the hydration of the pore are all strongly coupled

with each other.

Do these wetting/dewetting phenomena play any role in the

temperature dependence observed in our simulations? Simple

thermodynamics arguments suggest a possible connection

between the equilibrium properties of the waters conﬁned in

the PCs and the stability of the conductive conformation (see

SI for a formal derivation). In particular, if the heat capacity of

the open state is larger than that of the closed one, an increase

in temperature can trigger the opening of the channel. We

hypothesize that the dewetting of the PCs (the microscopic-

length-scale analogue of a liquid−vapor transition) might be

responsible for this increase in heat capacity. Indeed, the

probability distribution function of PCs hydration number is

approximately Gaussian at 280 and 300 K (Figure 4a). By

contrast, at 340 K, the free energy proﬁle “ﬂattens out” and the

PC can host, with approximately equal probability, zero, one, or

more water molecules (Figure 4a). This “critical” behavior

ought to be responsible for a sudden increase in heat capacity.

Water conﬁned in small hydrophobic cavities (of size

comparable to large as 20

kthcael/PmCos)l/sKhowuppoenaksmienltitnhge.2p7l−o2t9ofUCnpdvesr

T as the

conditions considered in this work, this value can produce a

stabilization of the open state of approximately −3.5 kcal/mol

(see SI for details), a value in remarkable agreement with the

ΔΔG extrapolated from our free energy proﬁles. We note,

however, that the mechanism of TRPV1 temperature activation

is more complex and possibly involves several channel regions.6−15,30 Importantly, while the turret deletion channel

used in our study does retain temperature sensitivity, the

conclusions based on this construct should be regarded as

tentative if transferred to the wild type TRPV1.

In summary, we ﬁnd that the closed to open transition in a temperature-sensitive channel is triggered by small perturbations, which are, nonetheless, suﬃcient to alter the hydration of the channel pore: the rotation of N676 alters the hydrophobic character of the molecular surface lining the pore, thereby aﬀecting its hydration and ion permeation. Susceptibility to perturbations is not uncommon in the pores of ion channels. Liquid−vapor oscillations have been reported several times31−42 and are, arguably, the result of a precise evolutionary optimization: due to a ﬁne-tuned hydrophobicity, pores undergoing hydrophobic gating are poised to transition and therefore maximally responsive to activating stimuli. In the case of TRPV1, the structural element exhibiting liquid−vapor oscillations is a pocket on the surface of the cytosolic side of the channel: interestingly, concave nonpolar surfaces have been shown to enhance water density ﬂuctuations.43 Finally, since the dehydration of small hydrophobic cavities shows strong dependence also on pressure and osmolarity, our simulations raise the intriguing hypothesis that a uniﬁed activation mechanism might underlie activation of TRPV channels by diverse external stimuli, such as osmotic stress44 and hydrostatic pressure.45
