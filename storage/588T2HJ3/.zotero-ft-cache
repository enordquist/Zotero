ABSTRACT: Field-induced nanopore wetting by aqueous solutions, including electrolytes, provides opportunities for a variety of applications. Conﬂicting porosity requirements have so far precluded direct implementations of a two-way control: the pores have to be suﬃciently wide to allow water inﬁltration at experimentally relevant voltages but should not exceed the kinetic threshold for spontaneous expulsion in the absence of the ﬁeld. Applicable widths are restricted below a few nanometers. Only a narrow window of ﬁelds and pore geometries can simultaneously satisfy both of the above requirements. Accurate accounts of wetting equilibria and dynamics at nanoscale porosity require molecular level descriptions. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to study dynamic, ﬁeld-controlled transitions between nanoconﬁned liquid and vapor phases in contact with an unperturbed aqueous or electrolyte environment. In nanopores wetted by electrolyte solutions, we observe depletion of salt compared to the bulk phase. The application of a local electric ﬁeld enhances the uptake of water and ions in the conﬁnement. In systems prone to capillary evaporation, the process can be reversed at suﬃcient strength of the electric ﬁeld. For alternating displacement ﬁeld, we identify the conditions where O (ns) responses of the reversible inﬁltration/ expulsion cycle can be secured for experimentally realizable ﬁeld strengths, porosity, and salinity of the solution.

I. INTRODUCTION
Transient wetting of hydrophobic nanochannels or pores is of interest for a range of applications including hydrophobic valves,1,2 control of membrane permeability,3 energy storage in porous substrates,4−8 and regulated wettability.9 Aﬃnity between the pore and water can be modulated by a variety of external stimuli, including light,2 temperature,10 pH,2 pressure,8,11,12 or electric ﬁeld.1,2,12−22 Because of the comparative ease of application, and fast and uniform control, several experimental studies1,2 examined the use of applied ﬁeld in dynamic wetting experiments. Together with related studies concerned with capillary condensation,19,23,24 these works show wetting of hydrophobic nanopores could generally be induced by the ﬁeld. However, at above a few nm porosity, reversible dewetting of pores surrounded by an aqueous bath presents a challenge, with the wetted state kinetically stalled2 because of high activation barriers for evaporation.25−33
Descending to narrow O(1) nm pores, in this work, we demonstrate the possibility of complete, fully reversible ﬁlling/ emptying cycles by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Molecular approach is essential, as aqueous nanoconﬁnements show important quantitative and qualitative deviations from the continuum picture,34,35 both in the absence26,28,30,36−41 and presence13,16−18,21,22,42−44 of an applied electric ﬁeld. Main diﬀerences can be explained in terms of interfacial hydrogen bonding,45−48 responsible for anisotropic polarizability of aqueous interfaces and associated ﬁeld-direction eﬀects.18,21,44,48,49 In short, the lateral component of the permittivity tensor in a nanoscale slit is about twice bigger than the normal one. Likewise, the ﬁeld-induced increase

in surface wettability is notably stronger in a parallel than normal ﬁeld. When the ﬁeld is applied across the pore, a Janus interface can emerge, with the wetting propensity at the wall under the incoming ﬁeld exceeding the one in the outgoing ﬁeld.18,44,48 Anisotropy in polarization dynamics of interfacial water revealed in recent MD simulations50 can be even more pronounced than for static properties. These eﬀects are negligible at the macroscopic level but can modulate the phase behavior in nanoscale systems, characterized by strong representation of surface molecules.
Below, we describe the ﬁrst simulation study of dynamic, ﬁeld-controlled wetting/drying transitions in nanoconﬁned aqueous solutions. Because of the potential role dissolved ions could play in these electrostatically driven processes,14,51,52 we consider both the neat water and electrolyte solutions. As described in the Model and Methods section, our approach builds on the methodology we developed in a recent study of equilibrated, fully wetted pores under a static electric ﬁeld.22 The pore is immersed in an unperturbed bath at constant peripheral pressure and ﬁxed chemical potential. We describe a generalization to uniformly varying ﬁelds across the conﬁnement. We monitor the system evolution upon abruptly or gradually changing the displacement ﬁeld in the nanopore to induce water inﬁltration or expulsion. To suppress the barrier

to spontaneous expulsion, we use very narrow pores, which in turn require stronger electric ﬁelds to trigger inﬁltration. Continuum electrostatics oﬀers rough estimates of the threshold electric displacement ﬁeld, Dz, while we deduce the proﬁle of the electric ﬁeld Ez, modulated by dielectric screening, from the simulation results. Insights into ﬁlling/expulsion equilibria in conﬁnements surrounded by liquid bath, obtained in
our study, are readily applicable to the reverse problem of
capillary condensation from and evaporation to the surrounding vapor phase.19,23,24 A separate study would, however, be
needed to characterize the distinct transition kinetics in the
latter scenario. In the Results section, we compare temporal proﬁles of the
liquid density inside the nanopores for diﬀerent increasing or decreasing ﬁeld rates. For O(nm) wide apolar pores, complete wetting−dewetting cycles can be repeated with no restrictions. We observe only small variations of the inﬁltration (forward) branches in individual cycles. An insigniﬁcant inﬂuence of the rate of the ﬁeld increase implies small or negligible barriers to
liquid inf iltration. The reverse branch, on the other hand, is
poorly reproducible. A pronounced hysteresis and large
variance of expulsion times are indicative of a notable barrier
to expulsion. In view of a rapid increase of the barrier with interwall separation,25,27,29−33 spontaneous expulsion only takes
place at pore widths below a few nm. In salt solutions, narrow widths are conducive to salt depletion.53 Our simulations show
ions entering into, and withdrawing from, the pore together
with surrounding water; however, the salt molality is generally lowered inside the conﬁnement. In the uncharged nanosized
pores we consider, the presence of salt does not alter the
occurrence, or rate, of the observed wetting/drying transitions in any signiﬁcant way. This observation is indicative of a comparatively weak role of electro-osmotic ﬂow14 eﬀects. For speciﬁed pore and ﬁeld parameters, it hence supports
generalizations of model predictions for nanopore gating to
include pure water as well as ionic solutions.

II. MODEL AND METHODS

A. Simulated System. To capture transport processes

between the ﬁeld-exposed conﬁned phase and unperturbed

solution, a small model pore is embedded in a bigger ﬁeld-free

reservoir (Figure 1). The temperature is held at 300 K using a Nose−́ Hoover thermostat.54 Constant pressure in the bath,

close to the vapor pressure of water, is maintained by pressure buﬀering,22,55,56 provided by coexisting liquid and vapor

domains. For this purpose, two 7-10 Å wide vapor pockets

are created in the regions adjacent to purely repulsive walls,

placed at the top and bottom boundaries of the rectangular

simulation box, as illustrated in Figure 1. The resulting system

is self-barostating in NVT ensemble, with vanishing normal

component of reservoir pressure. The lateral pressure

components are negative consistent with the positive interfacial

free energy at the vapor−liquid interface. Water molecules

interact with the repulsive walls through a harmonic potential with a spring constant of 84 kJ mol Å−2. A detailed description of the method is given in the preceding work.22 The box

accommodates ion pairs when

For easier comparisons with previous studies,12,13,16−18,22,43,44,57−60 we represent water molecules using the extended simple point charge model (SPC/E).61 The

model has repeatedly been shown to provide satisfactory descriptions of dielectric and interfacial properties62−67 of

liquid water, an essential requirement for our study. In analogy
to other classical-simulation models of water, the SPC/E model
does not capture water dissociation. In simulated systems of size of up to 104 water molecules, this ignores the rare presence
of dissociated ion pairs: at neutral pH, a single pair of ions
would on average be present in the simulated system over
about 0.01% of the time of observation. While strong electric ﬁelds can enhance dissociation of water in microchannels,68 our calculations at Na+ and Cl− concentrations as high as 1 mol kg−1 reveal at most a minute inﬂuence of dissolved ions on the occurrence and rate of ﬁeld-controlled nanopore inﬁltration
and expulsion, the central phenomena of the present study.
In the center of the box, we place a nanopore comprised of a
pair of parallel platelets of circular shape. This geometry minimizes the area of the liquid−vapor interface formed in the
case of liquid expulsion from the pore, and enables a symmetric decay of the electric ﬁeld applied across the conﬁnement. To
enable spontaneous expulsion of water in the absence of the ﬁeld, the nanopore walls are made of strongly hydrophobic
materials, devoid of polar or ionizing groups. This way, the conﬁnement can switch from strongly hydrophobic in the absence of the applied ﬁeld to hydrophilic in its presence. Our
model pore walls are carved from a plate of butyl-functionalized69 graphane,70,71 a hydrogenated form of graphene with a high band gap,72 and a planar structure insensitive to chemical
substitutions. The insulating properties of graphane make it a

suitable prototypical material for simulations in the presence of ions73 or an externally applied ﬁeld. In a previous work, we determined the contact angle of water on pure graphane at ∼73°.69 Functionalization by butyl groups with a surface density of 4.01 nm−2, a typical density of physisorbed SAMs layers, brings the contact angle to that of a hydrocarbon.69,74 To improve computational eﬃciency, in this work, graphane is modeled using the united-atom representation with hydrocarbon groups described as Lennard-Jones entities with interaction parameters we collect in Table 1.

are based on OPLS-UA force ﬁelds with the energy constant ε of the terminal −CH3 group parametrized to capture the target contact angle of a strongly hydrophobic hydrocarbon brush. We use Na+ and Cl− force ﬁelds of Fyta and Netz.75 The ion force ﬁelds were parametrized with a Lennard-Jones cutoﬀ of 9 Å; hence, we adopted this cutoﬀ for all Lennard-Jones interactions. Lorentz−Berthelot mixing rules are used to describe water− ion, water−surface, and ion−surface interactions.
The pore wall diameters were 34 or 64 Å, with interplate
separation measured between graphane plates at 23 or 31 Å,
respectively. Corresponding separations between terminal methyl groups at opposing plates were ∼11 or 19 Å. The thickness d of the conﬁned aqueous slab accommodated inside
the pore at these separations (measured from the positions of
the Gibbs dividing surfaces) was 7 or 15 Å (see Figure 2). The bath water layers above and beneath the conﬁnement spanned around 2−2.5 nm, a thickness proven suﬃcient to avoid
evaporation events within these layers. Long-range interactions were treated by a particle−particle−
particle mesh solver (PPPM) with a real space cutoﬀ of 9 Å and relative precision tolerance in force per atom of 10−5. The Yeh−Berkowitz correction to the Ewald summation76 was used
to account for the two-dimensional periodicity of the system. B. Contact Angle Measurement. Reversible inﬁltration
and expulsion of water or solution from nanopores requires a
careful selection of system properties. Within a continuum
approximation, the widths supporting spontaneous liquid
expulsion from a cylindrical pore of diameter 2R can be estimated by a modiﬁed Kelvin equation for planar conﬁnements of ﬁnite lateral size26

Vertical lines denote the positions of graphane backbones (dotted green) and terminal methyl groups of butyl functionalizing chains (dashed red lines). The diﬀerence in peak heights at the inner and outer conﬁnement surfaces reﬂects diﬀerent contact angles, ∼128° on the inner (butylated) and 73° on the outer (bare graphane) side. The proﬁles reveal minute penetration of water into the butyl brush. The asymmetry of the peaks is associated with electric ﬁeld and polarization of water inside the pore (Dz = 0.031 C m−2).

important for the design of the system. We determined the contact angle of water on our functionalized surface from the simulations of cylindrical nanodroplets as described in a former work.69 A 6600 molecule nanodrop was placed on a rectangular graphane sheet of dimensions 12.4 × 19.1 nm2 and the contact angle sampled over several nanoseconds following ∼0.1 ns equilibration. The cylindrical drop geometry essentially eliminated line tension eﬀects, providing a good approximation to contact angles converged with respect to the droplet’s size. For model parameters from Table 1, with εCH3 = 0.1 kcal mol−1 and a short-range interaction cutoﬀ of 9 Å, the contact angle was 128 ± 3°. To explore the possibility of the contact angle reduction due to the presence of water surrounding the pore, we repeated contact angle calculations on graphane substrate sitting on an ∼1.6 nm thick aqueous slab. A statistically insigniﬁcant average reduction by 1−2° was found in the presence of the slab.79 The lack of “wetting transparency”,77,78 observed in contact angle measurements on graphene, is explained by the notably greater thickness of the butylated graphane used in our system.
For nanoscale pore diameters R and ambient pressure P, the denominator in eq 1 is dominated by the surface tension term, which reﬂects the cost of forming the liquid−vapor interface at the pore perimeter. The inequality γR−1 ≫ P leads to a simpler thermodynamic condition for evaporation, d < −R cosθc. For our smaller pore size, R ∼ 17 Å, this suggests d should be held below ∼11 Å, corresponding to the distance between terminal methyl groups on distinct walls h ∼ 15 Å (separation between graphane plates ∼27 Å). We choose h at 11 Å and d ∼ 7 Å. As d measures the width available to the centers of water oxygens, the pore accommodates about three layers of water molecules. To observe spontaneous expulsion in wider pores will generally require increasing the lateral dimension of the pore, R. However, while increased R eases the thermodynamic condition for evaporation given by eq 1, liquid can still remain stalled in the pore kinetically. A kinetic barrier to evaporation is known to rapidly increase with the width of the pore. In hydrocarbon nanopores, the barrier becomes prohibitive beyond a few nm width, with metastable liquid persisting

lateral size R.
C. Electric Field. To mimic the conditions between extended hydrophobic walls under a homogeneous ﬁeld, a uniform electric displacement ﬁeld Dz(r) = Dz(0), perpendicular to pore walls, is imposed across the core of the cylindrical conﬁnement at distances from the central axis r < rin (Figure 1). The ﬁeld D(r) describes the contribution of (implicit) external charges22 to the local electrostatic potential, ψ(r, z). εo is the permittivity of a vacuum, and Dz can be viewed as the surface density of the charge stored in a capacitor. The force acting on a molecular or ion charge qi due to the imposed ﬁeld is therefore Fi = qiD(r)/4πεo. To avoid the complications associated with the MD integration in a discontinuous ﬁeld,22 at distances exceeding rin, the ﬁeld Dz gradually decays over a ﬁnite interval rin ≤ r ≤ rout, vanishing at the conﬁnement border, r = rout. The ﬁeld decay with r is described by the relation

The radial electric displacement ﬁeld component, Dr(r, z), vanishes in homogeneous regions (r < rin or r > rout) but is nonzero within the region of varying Dz(r), rin ≤ r ≤ rout. Since D(r, z) is a conservative vector ﬁeld,

The details of the method, and its advantages over the use of explicit wall charges, are described in ref 22. The smooth variation of the ﬁeld supports the use of standard MD. Our computations were performed using the LAMMPS simulation

package with the velocity Verlet integrator and a simulation
time step of 1 fs. The stability of the integrator and the pressure-buﬀering method were veriﬁed in test NVE simulations as described in the previous work.22
To drive the liquid into a hydrophobic pore, Maxwell stress14,19,80,81 has to overcome the Laplace pressure associated
with unfavorable wetting free energy of the pore. For a pore with ﬁnite diameter (2R) under a uniform electric displacement ﬁeld D = (0, 0, Dz), a ﬁrst order continuum estimate for the thermodynamic condition for inﬁltration, analogous to eq 1, takes the form21,82

where εr approximates the relative permittivity of conﬁned liquid inside a wetted pore. We underscore that the mean-ﬁeld estimates (eqs 5−7), relying on continuum concepts, serve merely as a ballpark assessment of ﬁeld eﬀects. More rigorous
continuum level analyses of static properties and transition
dynamics are possible following refs 14 and 52 but are outside
the scope of our molecular level study. For O(nm) pore
diameters, ambient pressure P can be neglected in comparison to the surface tension term in the denominator. For ﬁxed separation d and εr−1 ≪ 1, eq 5 can be rewritten as a condition for minimal displacement ﬁeld capable of triggering inﬁltration

our hydrophobic pore, we consider a window of simulated electric displacement ﬁelds from zero to ∼0.03 C m−2.

Reductions of the necessary strength of the ﬁeld are possible

by increasing wall−wall separations. A 2- or even 3-fold

increase of d could be kinetically viable; however, the

concomitant increase of evaporation times renders these

situations less suitable for MD simulation studies.

molecules. The average cosine of the angle between water

dipoles and the direction of the ﬁeld, θz, has been shown to provide a good measure of the ﬁeld strength inside a ﬁeldexposed conﬁnement.86 In a recent study, we have shown22

how the change of ⟨cos θz⟩ can inform us about the local ﬁeld in systems with preexisting interfacial polarization50 observed even

in the absence of an external ﬁeld. The reader is referred to ref

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Abrupt Imposition, or Cessation of External Field. For selected nanopore dimensions and ambient conditions (P ∼ 0, T = 300 K), equilibration results in empty conﬁnement regardless of initial conﬁguration. The left panel of Figure 4 illustrates the uptake of water that follows the imposition of displacement ﬁeld of strength 0.031 C m−2 (ﬁeld corresponding to a capacitor electrode charge density of approximately an

The time origin corresponds to the imposition of the ﬁeld (Dz = 0.031 C m−2). The ﬁeld is switched oﬀ at t = 1.25 ns. Diﬀerent colors describe three independent runs under identical conditions.

elementary charge per 6−7 nm2). The initial, evacuated state is equilibrated in the absence of the ﬁeld. While much of the pore in this state is empty, the number of conﬁned (axial distance r < rout) molecules, NH2O, ﬂuctuates around 5−7% of the number
observed in a fully wetted pore, an eﬀect attributed to the
convex shape of the liquid/vapor interface at the pore
boundary. The process of inﬁltration begins the moment the ﬁeld is
turned on and, for a given geometry, completes in ∼0.2 ± 0.05 ns. The rate of inﬁltration appears faster in the initial stage that
corresponds to the adjustment in the meniscus curvature at the
liquid/vapor interface in response to the attraction of water into the region under the ﬁeld. The plots for three independent
runs, illustrated in Figure 4, indicate about 25% of the pore volume is ﬁlled at this stage. The process proceeds at a somewhat slower pace, as further inﬁltration involves unfavorable wetting of pore walls. The ﬁnal stage corresponds
to the collapse of the vapor bubble in the center of the pore. When the ﬁeld is turned oﬀ (time t = 1.25 ns in Figure 4), we
observe an immediate 17−19% decrease in water density inside
the pore. The magnitude of this change is compatible with the reversal of electrostriction of the conﬁned liquid phase, consistently observed upon imposition of similar ﬁelds in preceding works.16,18,22,43 Once electrostriction is lost, water density ﬂuctuates around the density of metastable liquid until a suﬃcient thermal ﬂuctuation brings the system across the free
energy barrier to cavitation. As the evaporation process depends on rare ﬂuctuation events, the times of evaporation observed in multiple inﬁltration/expulsion cycles are scattered
over a broad range from below 0.4 to several ns. Only about 0.1 ns elapses from the time of ∼15% depletion and complete
evacuation. In many runs beginning in a fully wetted state and with the ﬁeld turned oﬀ, not a single system has recovered its
initial density after >15% depletion, suggesting the radius of the critical vapor nucleus R* is around 6−7 Å. A mean ﬁeld
approximation for the barrier to vapor nucleation can be
obtained by considering the surface free energy of a cylindrical bubble25,31 of radius r, ΔΩ(r) ∼ 2πrdγ + 2πr2γ cos θc + Pπr2d, with the maximum at r = r* ∼ 5.7 Å. The estimated nucleus radius is in reasonable agreement with the apparent size of 6−7 Å deduced from the simulation. The mean ﬁeld estimate for the barrier itself, ΔΩ*(r*) ∼ 7.9 × 10−19 J or ∼19 kBT is less reliable, exceeding more accurate umbrella sampling results for similar systems.29−31,33 Applying umbrella sampling Monte Carlo, we determined31 the evaporation barrier in a laterally extended pore of width h = 14 Å, d ∼ 10 Å, and θc = 135° at 18.7 ± 1 kBT. According to the known scaling relation ΔΩ* ∝ d2/cosθc,25,32 extrapolation to d = 7 Å and θc = 128° obtains ΔΩ* ∼ 10.4 kBT, a value in reasonable agreement with observed evaporation kinetics. Using the observed evaporation times τe of O(0.1−10) ns and the crude relation τe ∼ (2πℏ/ kBT) exp(ΔΩ*/kBT) suggests activation barriers between 7 and 11 kBT (kB and 2πℏ denote Boltzmann and Planck constants).
B. Uniformly Varying Field. Response times observed in the above example suggest O(10−1) GHz is the limiting ﬁeld
frequency the system would be able to follow.
To explore the temporal response further, and to identify the threshold ﬁeld amplitude for pore wetting, we monitored the inﬁltration and expulsion processes under uniformly increasing or decreasing displacement ﬁelds. We compare the results for two rates of ﬁeld change, dDz/dt = ±9 × 10−3 C m−2 ns−1 or ±4.5 × 10−3 C m−2 ns−1. Figure 5 describes a typical cycle in

terms of the dependence of the number of conﬁned water

molecules, NH2O, as a function of Dz for the bigger rate of ±9 × 10−3 C m−2 ns−1. The weak initial response at ﬁelds below ∼2 × 10−2 C m−2 can be attributed to the change in the meniscus

curvature discussed with Figure 4, while the rapid increase in NH2O in the range (2.2−2.5) × 10−2 C m−2 reﬂects full scale
inﬁltration, which entails wetting of conﬁnement walls. The

threshold displacement ﬁeld is surprisingly close to the continuum estimate of ∼2.5 × 10−2 C m−2 provided by eq 5.

The gradual density rise beyond the inﬁltration transition is

consistent with intensiﬁed electrostriction in a fully wetted

nanopore.

ﬁelds, where the pore is ﬁlled by the liquid, reﬂects the

reduction in NH2O due to a gradual reversal of electrostriction with weakening of the ﬁeld. In this regime, the backward

branch coincides with the forward one. When the ﬁeld is

decreased below the threshold strength for inﬁltration,

however, the liquid typically persists in the pore. The expulsion

is delayed until the ﬁeld strength falls much lower, generally below 10−2 C m−2. In a fraction of runs, the ﬁeld actually

vanished before the evaporation took place. The pronounced

hysteresis is explained by the activation barrier to expulsion,

associated with the creation of the interface between the liquid

and vapor phases. Conversely, the inﬁltration process begins

with the liquid/vapor interface already in place and the area of

the interface decreases as the pore is ﬁlled with water. The

barrier to expulsion is expected to further increase in the

presence of applied ﬁeld, as the ﬁeld stabilizes fully wetted

states in comparison to the partially evacuated ones. We

conﬁrm this in trial calculations where we switch from the

forward to backward branch before complete inﬁltration.

We survey a set of cycles where the ﬁeld change was reversed

after complete ﬁlling of the pores. Figure 6 summarizes the

in diﬀerent colors correspond to the higher rate. In one of

them, evaporation took place after the ﬁeld fell to zero. Regardless of the rate of ﬁeld decay, evaporation was never observed at a displacement ﬁeld above 0.01 C m−2, which is below one-half of the threshold for inﬁltration. Wide scatter of evaporation events below this ﬁeld reﬂects the rare event

character of the process, rather than its reliance on further weakening of the ﬁeld. The inﬁltration branches are more

nanopore (rout = 17 Å, rin = 13 Å, and h = 11 Å) as a function of electric displacement ﬁeld Dz. Three cycles (red, blue, and green) are shown in full. As the shape of the cycles is similar in all cases, for the remaining eight cycles, we merely mark the positions of abrupt expulsion. Red, blue, and green curves and solid black circles correspond to the rate of ﬁeld change dDz/dt of ±9 × 10−3 C m−2 s−1. The three gray triangles were obtained at a slower ﬁeld decrease rate of −4.5 × 10−3 C m−2 s−1. Inﬁltration branches determined at the slower ﬁeld increase showed no appreciable diﬀerence from those obtained at a twice higher rate. One of the expulsion branches (blue) was completed at the time outside the plotted range.

reproducible. All of the remaining six cycles fell within the

range of the three inﬁltration curves shown in Figure 6. Three

of these six cycles were performed at twice slower ﬁeld change, dDz/dt = ±4.5 × 10−3 C m−2 ns−1, yet we observe no systematic deviation from the results obtained at the higher

rate. The only signiﬁcant diﬀerence between individual cycles

was found in times, and associated ﬁeld strengths, correspond-

ing to abrupt evaporation events. We identify these events by

registering positions of 50% evacuation. In Figure 6, they are

marked by solid circles (higher ﬁeld change rate) or triangles

(slower rate). Interestingly, all evaporation events observed at

the slower rate are grouped within the displacement ﬁeld interval of Dz = (0.5−1.0) × 10−2 C m−2. Poor reproducibility of the backward (evacuation) branch conﬁrms these are rare

events. By and large, evaporation times of 10 ns suﬃce for

complete evacuation of water from the nanopore even when

the ﬁeld is turned oﬀ smoothly rather than in a stepwise

fashion.

C. Electrolyte Solution. So far, we have considered only

pure water. Dissolved ions could, however, be present in many

applications, ranging from nanoﬂuidics to controlled perme-

ation of porous electrode materials. In addition to electrostatic

shielding, ions can modulate ﬁeld eﬀects on nanopore wetting by supporting electro-osmotic ﬂow in the channels.14 These

possibilities are examined by extending our model calculations

to cases where pure water is replaced by NaCl solutions. We used a relatively high bulk molality of 1.027 mol kg−1 to amplify

any changes. Salt concentration in a hydrophobic conﬁnement

is lower than in the surrounding bath, due to reduced

opportunities for ion hydration and low permittivity of the walls.53 Statistics in molality calculations for the 7 Å wide

conﬁnement is poor. In Figure 7 we illustrate the qualitative

trend by comparing conﬁned and bulk NaCl molalities in

bigger pores. They are made up of identical wall material but

with diameter 64 Å, rout = 32 Å and d = 15 Å. We use three

neutrality with a slight preference for Cl− ions. The trend

toward salt depletion intensiﬁes in the narrow slit with d = 7 Å.

Here, ions with an intact ﬁrst hydration shell are limited to a

thin layer of |z| ≤ 1 Å from the midplane of the pore. The

remaining core molality of the ions shows big ﬂuctuations around the average value of O(0.1) mol kg−1 with strong

dominance of sodium ions. A small number of conﬁned ions (0

to O(1)) precludes accurate statistics of ion molalities in these

pores.

presence of the salt are hardly distinguishable from those shown

in Figures 5 and 6 for pure water. Likewise, the simulated

faster process shown in Figure 8. The small increase in saline contact angle, compared to that of pure water,58 shifts the

inﬁltration transition to a stronger displacement ﬁeld. This

change is consistent with a salt-induced increase of inﬁltration pressure observed8 in wider nanopores. While the addition of

salt has shown a moderate hysteresis reduction of the inﬁltration−expulsion cycle under pressure control,7,8 no

statistically meaningful trend could be deduced from our

simulation results. Notwithstanding small quantitative adjustments, the above comparisons indicate our ﬁndings obtained in

pure water simulations also apply to salt solutions, at least for

selected conditions.

D. Incomplete Cycles. To estimate the position of the activation barrier to water expulsion in the presence of the ﬁeld,

in a number of runs started under uniformly increasing Dz, we initiate the reverse process (ﬁeld decrease) from incompletely ﬁlled conﬁgurations. As illustrated by the examples presented in Figure 10, if the inﬁltration already reached ∼65−70% completion, it promptly proceeded toward the fully ﬁlled state even under decreasing ﬁeld. This result indicates the likely radius of the critical vapor nucleus, r*(Dz), corresponding to the activation barrier for evaporation at the speciﬁed ﬁeld strength (Dz ∼ 0.025 C m−2) to be around 8.5 ± 1 Å. This value is comparable to the mean ﬁeld prediction. In analogy

with our earlier estimate of the nucleus size in the absence of the ﬁeld (section A), one can approximate free energy of

cavitation as a function of the radius of cylindrical vapor cavity in the pore center for ﬁnite Dz16

Figure 10. Density evolution (quantiﬁed in terms of the number of water molecules, NH2O) in four backward runs (decreasing ﬁeld, dDz/ dt = −9 × 10−3 C m−2 s−1) inside a nanopore with radius rout = 17 Å, rin = 13 Å, and h = 11 Å. The runs were initiated at four conﬁgurations (solid circles) taken from previous inﬁltration (increasing ﬁeld) branches (dashed red). The data are indicative of a shallow barrier to inﬁltration at about 50% ﬁlling.
At Dz ∼ 0.025 C m−2, ΔΩ(r, Dz) passes through the maximum at r* ∼ 8.3 Å. If the ﬁeld begins decreasing before the vapor cavity shrinks below the critical size r*, inﬁltration is reversed without delay. However, once the cavity collapses, because of Maxwell stress contribution (the last term in eq 7), the barrier to vapor nucleation remains prohibitive (upper-bound mean ﬁeld estimate ΔΩ(r*, Dz) ∼ 27 kBT), delaying eventual expulsion until Dz is signiﬁcantly reduced. In our simulations, expulsion occurred only at displacement ﬁelds below ∼0.01 C m−2. The same applied to 1 mol kg−1 NaCl solution, and we observe no signiﬁcant eﬀect of added salt on the hysteresis of the ﬁlling/emptying cycle.
While we focused on a single pore size because of computational constraints, extrapolations to other sizes are possible on the basis of our results and fair agreement with mean ﬁeld relations, eqs 1, 5, and 6. According to eq 5, increasing the pore diameter d will reduce the magnitude of displacement ﬁeld required for inﬁltration. Because of the steep rise of the activation barrier29,32 to expulsion with d, in the case of water, the increase in d is limited to below 10 molecular diameters.25,26,30,31,33 Combining the eﬀect of the ﬁeld and external pressure, on the other hand, can facilitate intrusion when the pores prove too narrow to be wetted under electric ﬁeld alone.12 On the basis of eq 6, electric control of nanopore ﬁlling can be extended to other nonwetting liquids provided the inverse dielectric constant, εr−1, is suﬃciently diﬀerent from unity, a condition fulﬁlled by strongly and moderately polar liquids.
IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Our molecular simulations show an applied electric ﬁeld can enable reversible control of wetting and dewetting in hydrophobic nanochannels. In similar experimental and theoretical studies, reversal of ﬁlling transition relied on the remnants of air or vapor inside the wetted pores. In narrow carbon nanotube pores conducive to spontaneous expulsion, on the other hand, inﬁltration required increased pressure in addition to the ﬁeld.12 Using appropriate pore geometry, we observe complete wetting/drying transitions inside the conﬁnement, controlled solely by the applied ﬁeld.
Fair estimates of critical pore dimensions and required external ﬁeld, as well as the dimensions of the vapor nuclei associated with the kinetic barrier to water expulsion, can be obtained from a continuum/mean ﬁeld picture. Neglecting

crucial thermal ﬂuctuations, this approach is adequate to predict
qualitative trends but overestimates absolute magnitudes of activation barriers.29 In ∼1 nm sized pores, kinetic barriers result in pronounced wetting−dewetting hysteresis, yet they cannot support long-lived metastable conﬁned liquid phases unless assisted by at least a fraction of the ﬁeld initially required for inﬁltration. Our observations in neat water remain
essentially unchanged in the presence of salt ions. The addition of salt slightly increases the threshold ﬁeld for inﬁltration but
does not appear to alleviate the hysteresis, as indicated in earlier measurements.8 Our studies set the stage for the design of ﬁeldcontrolled nanoﬂuidic valves, regulated pore permeation,
absorption of surface energy in a hydrophobic porous medium, and nanoﬂuidic transistors92 driven by electrically stimulated
phase transitions.
