Abstract
Stunning advances have been achieved in addressing the protein folding problem, providing deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which proteins navigate energy landscapes to reach their native states and enabling powerful algorithms to connect sequence to structure. However, the realities of the in vivo protein folding problem remain a challenge to reckon with. Here, we discuss the concept of the “proteome folding problem”—the problem of how organisms build and maintain a functional proteome—by admitting that folding energy landscapes are characterized by many misfolded states and that cells must deploy a network of chaperones and degradation enzymes to minimize deleterious impacts of these off-pathway species. The resulting proteostasis network is an inextricable part of in vivo protein folding and must be understood in detail if we are to solve the proteome folding problem. We discuss how the development of computational models for the proteostasis network’s actions and the relationship to the biophysical properties of the proteome has begun to offer new insights and capabilities.

The Protein Folding Problem
In 1958, Kendrew et al. published the ﬁrst threedimensional model of the structure of a globular protein, sperm whale myoglobin. Although the resolution was only 6 A, the complexity of the structure was abundantly clear and led the authors to remark: “The arrangement seems to be almost totally lacking in the kind of regularities which one instinctively anticipates, and it is more complicated than has been predicted by any theory of protein structure”.1 This complexity became even more apparent in later, higher resolution structures of myoglobin.2 In parallel with these studies, Anﬁnsen and others were studying the process of protein folding using bovine pancreatic ribonuclease as a model protein. They discovered that the complicated struc-

tures reported by Kendrew and others seemed to be the thermodynamically most stable conformations that could be adopted by polypeptide chains. Moreover, they showed that these structures could be attained without assistance from any external biological machinery, despite their complexity.3–6 These two lines of work immediately suggested that protein primary structures contain all the information needed to produce the rich complexity evident in protein tertiary structures. And so, the protein folding problem was born.
The protein folding problem has dominated protein science for the past 60 years. There are many deﬁnitions of it, but we prefer Dill’s threepart formulation7,8: (1) how do we predict a protein’s three-dimensional tertiary structure from its onedimensional primary structure? (2) how do the vari-

ous intra- and intermolecular interactions in the system (protein–protein, protein-solvent, and solvent– solvent) determine this three-dimensional structure? and (3) what is (are) the pathway(s) by which it is formed? Tremendous progress has been made on all three aspects of the protein folding problem, and this progress has been accelerating as more powerful computational and experimental methods have been brought to bear.9 This past year, however, we witnessed an extraordinary advance toward a solution to the protein folding problem in the performance of AlphaFold, an artiﬁcial intelligence program developed by DeepMind to predict protein structures. In CASP14 (the 14th running of the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction competition), AlphaFold was able to predict the three-dimensional structures of an array of proteins with a median accuracy that was as high as that of models built from experimental data.10,11 The potential utility of this algorithm was recently powerfully demonstrated by predicting the structures of almost every protein in the human proteome.12 While AlphaFold cannot be considered a comprehensive solution to the protein folding problem—it addresses only the ﬁrst of the three questions that make up the protein folding problem as deﬁned above—we believe that it probably will mark a new era in protein science. As such this seems like a suitable moment to pause and consider what challenges might deﬁne the next 60 years of protein science the way that the protein folding problem has deﬁned the last 60.
The Proteome Folding Problem
The protein folding problem focuses on one outcome that can occur when an unstructured protein is placed under native conditions: folding to the functional native structure. However, it has long been known that folding is not so straightforward for many (if not most) proteins, and that other, more untoward outcomes are possible.13 Proteins can become trapped in misfolded conformations that represent local minima on their folding energy landscapes.14,15 This is especially true for longer proteins with more complicated topologies, which are underrepresented among proteins for which detailed in vitro folding studies have been done.16 This situation can be visualized with a folding energy landscape that contains more than one deep minimum, as suggested by Clark in 2004.15 Such a folding energy landscape is depicted in Figure 1. If these misfolded conformers are abundant enough and persist for long enough, they can self-associate to form aggregates that are virtually never salutary to a cell and are usually toxic, especially in their early stages of formation.17–20 Even if misfolded proteins did not aggregate, it is very unlikely that they would be functional, and such a loss-of-function could be devas-

tating.17,19,20 Moreover, many different proteins are present simultaneously in vivo, a feature of the proteome folding problem that introduces major complexity. To mitigate the effects of protein misfolding, all organisms from the time of the last universal common ancestor have had a network of cellular components that is tasked with maintaining protein homeostasis, or “proteostasis”, which is the condition of an organism having enough properly folded proteins to carry out the functions essential to life but not so much misfolded/aggregated protein as to interfere with these functions.21,22
Recognizing that protein folding is not an ideal process and that there is biological machinery that exists to help it along raises a different problem that has been gaining recognition over the past two decades14–19,23,24 and that we believe will become one of the dominant questions in protein science going forward: the proteome folding problem. In our view, the proteome folding problem can be broken into two questions. The ﬁrst is still intrinsic to protein sequences under a given set of conditions: what alternative states are competitive with the native state, either thermodynamically or kinetically or both, on the protein folding energy landscape as it exists in living cells? This question subsumes the original protein folding problem, but it also requires an understanding of the energetics of non-native states, which would have been considered decoys or incorrect solutions in the context of the original protein folding problem. In addition, it includes issues relating to the environment within cells. Many environmental variables that can profoundly inﬂuence protein folding vary not only between cells but also within cells—from organelle to organelle and potentially even between liquid–liquid phase separated domains in a single organelle.25–29 These variables include but are not limited to: the pH; the concentrations of ions and osmolytes30–32; and macromolecular crowding.33–35
The second question in the proteome folding problem is largely extrinsic to protein sequences: how do components of the biological folding machinery, the “proteostasis network”, interact with proteins to optimize protein folding outcomes, or when folding fails, how do they mitigate the impact of protein folding failures? We examine these questions in the following sections.
Non-Native States of Proteins and the
Cellular Folding Environment
A useful example of the non-native states of proteins comes from work by the Anﬁnsen lab on ribonuclease folding.4,15 Ribonuclease has eight cysteine residues that can form four disulﬁde bonds. There are 105 possible pairings of these cysteines as disulﬁdes, only one of which allows native folding and function. Re-folding reduced and denatured ribonuclease under conditions that permit cysteine

Figure 1. Protein folding energy landscape with multiple minima, following the depiction by Clark.15 The blue areas represent the unfolded state, while the three energy wells shown represent the native state and two non-native states (a misfolded monomer and an aggregated state, as labeled). The aggregated state becomes more stable as the protein concentration increases. Protein that enters the non-native states may have to cross signiﬁcant energy barriers to reach the native state, making these steps potentially rate-limiting for folding.

oxidation to disulﬁdes, but not subsequent disulﬁde shufﬂing, produces a mixture in which many, or perhaps even most, of the 104 mispaired combinations of disulﬁdes can be found; these all represent nonnative states.
Non-native states would not be a problem for biological protein folding if they were transient. They become a problem only when substantial amounts of protein become trapped in non-native states on time scales comparable to other biological processes like protein synthesis, protein trafﬁcking, cell division, etc. In the case of ribonuclease, even when refolding is performed in a redox buffer so that disulﬁde interchange is possible, non-native states with mispaired disulﬁdes form quickly but resolve relatively slowly to the native state.3,4,36 As a result, a substantial fraction of ribonuclease is non-native as it reacquires the native state over the course of more than an hour. As Anﬁnsen observed at the time,37 this situation seems biologically untenable.
Ribonuclease becomes trapped in non-native states because these states are kinetically stabilized by the disulﬁde bonds between mispaired cysteine residues. Such covalent linkages, however, are not necessary to create long-lived non-native states. The same forces that stabilize protein native states can stabilize misfolded states, perhaps not as efﬁciently since misfolded states should not be as well-packed as native states, but the energy barrier to “unmisfold” a non-native state could cause a substantial slowing of the overall rate of native

folding and lead to a persistent population of nonnative protein.15
Non-native states can also be stabilized by aggregation. In this case, parts of a protein that normally interact intramolecularly in the native state end up on the surface of a non-native state where they can drive self-association via intermolecular interactions.15,18,38,39 The stability of aggregates formed in this way is concentration dependent. If the aggregation-prone non-native state is below a “critical concentration”, then aggregation will not occur. Above that concentration, aggregation is possible.18,39,40 In addition, aggregation will be faster as the concentration increases further.39,41 Native folding is likely to be rate limited by the off-rate for protein molecules dissociating from aggregates, which could be very slow indeed (Figure 1). Even worse, the aggregated state can overtake the native state to become the thermodynamically most stable state, especially if the native state stability is compromised by an environmental factor (temperature, pH, etc.) or mutation, or if the protein is highly concentrated as could occur if it was, for example, preferentially partitioned into a phase separated domain.25
Answering the ﬁrst question of the proteome folding problem—what alternative states compete with the native state on the protein folding energy landscape?—requires the ability to predict the properties of non-native states in the cellular environment (i.e., accounting for the pH, solute composition, crowding, etc. inside the cell) from sequence information. This is like the protein

folding problem, but non-native states of proteins are much more difﬁcult to study than native states. Non-native states are heterogeneous, and/or amorphous, and/or insoluble; all these qualities interfere with the usual techniques that are used to study proteins. Nevertheless, substantial inroads have been made in the experimental characterization of non-native states, especially the class of ﬁbrillar, and often disease-associated, protein aggregates known as amyloid.42 Detailed structures of amyloid ﬁbrils have now been obtained by solid-state NMR,43,44 X-ray and electron diffraction of microcrystals,45,46 and cryo-electron microscopy.47–48 Less structured non-native states have been characterized as well (albeit at much lower resolution) using, for example, single-molecule methods,49–52 small-angle X-ray scattering,53,54 NMR,55,56 and other methods.57
Real progress in determining the sequencestructure-energy relationships in the cellular milieu will of course require much more experimental data of the sort described in the preceding paragraph, but in addition this data will have to be wedded to computational methods so that the underlying physics can be understood. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that algorithms like AlphaFold, which rely primarily on structural bioinformatics-based methods for native structure prediction, will be useful for this endeavor. The massive databases of non-native protein structures that would be needed do not exist, and probably cannot exist because so many nonnative states are heterogeneous and dynamic. Computationally exploring non-native regions of the protein folding energy landscape is likely to be the province of computational molecular physics methods.9 Such methods operate from ﬁrst principles and therefore do not need auxiliary databases. As these methods become faster and more reliable, they will become better able to predict protein misfolding as well as protein folding and ﬁll a central role in solving the proteome folding problem.
The Proteostasis Network
If the proteome folding problem were just about characterizing non-native states, it would simply be an extension of the protein folding problem. There would be nothing “proteomic” about such a problem because the structures and energetics of non-native states are still inherent in the primary sequence and the cellular environment, complex as it is. However, the non-native states of cellular proteins must compete for attention from the proteostasis network, and through this competition their folding energy landscapes communicate with each other. Misfolding by one protein means that the proteostasis network has less bandwidth to handle other proteins, which leads to the other proteins misfolding as well; this effect has been

compellingly demonstrated in multiple systems.58– 61 Thus, protein misfolding to non-native states and/or aggregates is truly a proteomic problem in a way that native folding is not.
As we mentioned in the previous section, Anﬁnsen recognized at the time of his original work on ribonuclease folding that ribonuclease’s unassisted folding rate was too slow to be biologically reasonable. To address this, Anﬁnsen and others searched for, and found, a catalyst for ribonuclease folding in cell extracts: protein disulﬁde isomerase (PDI).15,37,62–65 Although this result did not get as much attention as the ﬁnding that ribonuclease’s native state was its thermodynamically most stable conformation, we believe it was equally profound. It showed that, although protein folding can spontaneously yield the native state, it nevertheless requires biological intervention to operate reliably enough in living, evolving organisms with the inherent challenges of the in vivo environment and the multitude of simultaneous folding/unfolding/misfolding events.
After the discovery of PDI it still took decades before there was a more-or-less complete accounting of the types of components that make up the proteostasis network. Now we recognize that perhaps the most prominent components of the proteostasis network are the chaperones, including the Hsp70,66 Hsp6067 and Hsp90 systems,68 the small Hsps,69 and the Hsp100s70 (Hsp = heat shock protein). Also prominent are the ATP-driven proteases that degrade non-native proteins, including AAA + ATPases like Lon in prokaryotes71 and larger systems like the ubiquitin–proteasome system72 and the autophagylysosome pathway73 in eukaryotes. Together, the chaperones and the degradation machinery, along with proto-chaperones like polyphosphate74; posttranslational modiﬁcations like glycosylation and their associated machinery75; the effect of cotranslational folding76–79; folding enzymes like the PDIs80 and the cis–trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerases81; and the signaling pathways that regulate the concentrations of all these components82– 84 act to promote folding, discourage misfolding, disperse aggregates, or degrade non-native proteins to recycle their constituent amino acids.
Answering the second question of the proteome folding problem—how do proteostasis network components optimize protein folding and mitigate the consequences of folding failures?—requires a comprehensive understanding of how proteostasis network components act on their substrates. This includes the kinetics, thermodynamics, and sequence selectivity of substrate binding by proteostasis network components. Some sequence-based predictive algorithms for the energetics of such interactions have already been proposed for some of the more prominent chaperones, like Hsp70.85–87 Fundamental under-

The proteome folding problem is not simply the next frontier in protein science. Failures of proteostasis have been implicated in many human diseases, including gain-of-toxicity (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, the transthyretin amyloidoses, etc.) and loss-of-function diseases (cystic ﬁbrosis, Gaucher’s disease, Fabry’s disease, etc.).17,19,20,91 Thus, understanding proteostasis is important at both a fundamental and a practical level. At a fundamental level, understanding proteostasis informs us about the challenges involved in maintaining the thousands to tens of thousands of proteins in typical organismal proteomes in a functional state, which is a clear prerequisite to understanding how organisms survive and evolve in the face of environmental challenges. At a practical level, many proposed therapies for protein misfolding diseases involve promoting folding or inhibiting aggregation by improving protein folding energetics (through kinetic stabilization or pharmacologic chaperoning of proteins with destabilizing mutations)92–95 or by manipulating the proteostasis network (through modulating the concentrations or activities of proteostasis network components).17,19,91,96–101 Both endeavors require a systems-level appreciation of in vivo protein folding, but how can such an appreciation be achieved?

ing, to the bimolecular chaperone-substrate recognition events, among many other processes (Figure 2). Thus, the primary challenge with developing a model for in vivo protein folding is parameterizing it. We have argued that literature estimates of these parameters based on in vitro experiments are suitable for processes like associations between chaperones and co-chaperones that do not directly involve the substrate.110 The parameters for processes that involve individual members of the proteomes, however, should differ from protein to protein, in principle requiring thousands or tens of thousands of parameters for the model.
A computational model of the sort described in the preceding section that could accurately predict these parameters may one day solve this parameterization problem. In the meantime, we are fortunate that near-proteome-wide estimates of many biophysical properties have been made for E. coli proteins using either experimental or computational methods, including native state stability,122,123 folding kinetics,124 and solubility/aggregation125—which together deﬁne much of a protein’s folding energy landscape—as well as chaperone efﬁcacy for the Hsp70 and Hsp60 systems.126 We recently used these estimates to create a coarse-grained representation of the entire
