A unique feature of chemical catalysis mediated by enzymes is that the catalytically reactive atoms are embedded within a folded protein. Although current understanding of enzyme function has been focused on the chemical reactions and static threedimensional structures, the dynamic nature of proteins has been proposed to have a function in catalysis1–5. The concept of conformational substates has been described6; however, the challenge is to unravel the intimate linkage between protein ﬂexibility and enzymatic function. Here we show that the intrinsic plasticity of the protein is a key characteristic of catalysis. The dynamics of the prolyl cis–trans isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) in its substrate-free state and during catalysis were characterized with NMR relaxation experiments. The characteristic enzyme motions detected during catalysis are already present in the free enzyme with frequencies corresponding to the catalytic turnover rates. This correlation suggests that the protein motions necessary for catalysis are an intrinsic property of the enzyme and may even limit the overall turnover rate. Motion is localized not only to the active site but also to a wider dynamic network. Whereas coupled networks in proteins have been proposed previously3,7–10, we experimentally measured the collective nature of motions with the use of mutant forms of CypA. We propose that the pre-existence of collective dynamics in enzymes before catalysis is a common feature of biocatalysts and that proteins have evolved under synergistic pressure between structure and dynamics.
The most basic principle of enzyme catalysis is the ability of an enzyme to decrease the transition-state energy, thereby catalysing the chemical reaction. A wealth of information about the kinetics and thermodynamics of enzyme-catalysed reactions has been obtained by monitoring the conversion of substrates into products. However, much less is known about the kinetics and energetics of conformational processes in the protein. Because it is the protein component that alters the transition state energy, enzyme function depends on transitions from ground states to higher-energy states of the enzyme and the reactant. A detailed understanding of the entire trajectory of catalysis is therefore a current challenge. Structures of intermediates provide snapshots of conformational changes, and a set of experimental methods, such as ﬂuorescence, mass spectroscopy and NMR, have been developed to monitor the kinetics of these changes. We have recently provided a proof of principle that enzyme dynamics can be monitored during catalysis at multiple sites by NMR relaxation experiments with the use of cyclophilin A (CypA)5. This enzyme belongs to the family of prolyl-isomerases that catalyse the cis–trans isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds. Although CypA is involved in a series of biomedically important processes11, its natural biological role and mechanism of action are still in debate. CypA is the target of the

immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) and is essential for HIV-1 virulence12.
Here we use new NMR relaxation dispersion experiments13 to compare motions in free CypA with those during turnover. We show that protein dynamics associated with catalysis is a built-in property of the enzyme that is also manifested in the free protein. The motions are collective, propagating from the active site to remote sites. The results show that intrinsic plasticity on a basic structural template is a crucial element for catalytic function, and that proteins have therefore evolved under synergistic pressure between structure and dynamics.
Relaxation dispersion experiments probe molecular motions in the microsecond to millisecond timescale quantitatively and with much higher sensitivity than traditional transverse relaxation experiments13. The additional line-broadening of NMR signals caused by conformational exchange between two states (Rex) depends on the sum of forward and reverse rates of interconversion (kex), the relative populations of the exchanging species (pA and p B) and the chemical shifts between the exchanging species (Dq), with

in the fast exchange limit14. The dependence of Rex on the applied external ﬁeld (vCPMG, in
which CPMG stands for Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill) is the key element in relaxation dispersion experiments (Fig. 1a, b). It is noted that an atom with Rex contributions reports on a change in its electronic environment, but this does not necessarily represent physical movement of this atom.
We applied this method to 15N-labelled CypA catalysing the cis–trans isomerization of N-succinyl-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Fig. 1, right). The high sensitivity of these experiments leads to the identiﬁcation of many more amides in CypA with conformational exchange than originally described5. Clear and quantitative analysis of the relaxation data require conditions of two-state exchange. However, CypA interconverts between at least three states during the catalytic cycle: the free enzyme (E) and the two enzyme–substrate (ES) complexes with substrate bound in the cis and trans conformations. The system was therefore biochemically ‘tuned’ to two-state exchange: by using an excess of substrate at 10 8C, 95% saturation with substrate could be reached in which the dispersion proﬁles detect only two-state conformational exchange corresponding to the catalytic step of cis–trans isomerization (scheme (2)). Under these conditions, contributions to Rex from substrate binding and dissociation are negligible (see Supplementary Information).
Individual ﬁts of dispersion proﬁles on a collection of 30 amides resulted in similar rate constants, a remarkable result that justiﬁes a

global ﬁt with a single rate constant, kex (Fig. 1a, b, right). This result is further buttressed by 13C-CPMG dispersion experiments on methyl side chains13 (Fig. 1a, right). Comparison of the dynamic
hotspots of amide nitrogens (Fig. 1c, d) and methyl carbons (Fig. 1e)
reveals an extended dynamic network emanating from the active site of CypA. 15N and 13C relaxation data could be globally ﬁtted with the same kex value of 2,730 ^ 220 s21 (mean ^ s.d.) and separation into the individual rate constants (scheme (2)) was based on the relative
populations of cis and trans bound substrates determined previously15. This kex value of protein motion is very close to the sum of the rate constants of cis-to-trans (k ct) and trans-to-cis (k tc) substrate isomerization on the enzyme (kex ¼ 2,500 ^ 500 s21; mean ^ s.d.)15.

Our earlier work indicated a possible intimate correlation between motion on the enzyme and substrate turnover5, but the system was underdetermined with respect to the exact rate of conformational exchange. The present results show explicitly that conformational changes of the enzyme coincide with substrate turnover.
Although it is not surprising that conformational rearrangements occur in the working enzyme, we found that most of these same residues exhibit exchange in the resting, substrate-free state (Fig. 1, left). Quantitative analysis revealed that most residues can be globally ﬁtted with a kex value of 1,140 ^ 200 s21 (mean ^ s.d.) (Fig. 1a, left) for an exchange process between a major and a minor population (of less than 10%; see Methods). Notably, one of the exchange rates in free CypA is comparable to those observed during turnover:

It is also noteworthy that the calculated chemical-shift differences (equation (1)) between Emajor and Eminor (q Emajor 2 q ; Eminor scheme (3)) are similar to those between EScis and EStrans (q EScis 2 q ; EStrans scheme (2)) for residues remote from the substrate, suggesting that the cis substrate binds Emajor to form EScis, whereas the trans substrate binds Eminor to form EStrans. This would imply that binding of the substrates shifts the pre-existing, highly skewed equilibrium to a more balanced one.
Besides the interconversion detected between Emajor and Eminor, a speciﬁc region (the loop comprising residues 65–84) clearly moves faster, with a kex of 2,260 ^ 200 s21 (mean ^ s.d.) (Fig. 1b, left) in the free enzyme. This result implies that motions in proteins are usually more complex than mere interconversion between two conformational states. Folded proteins must in fact be described with a multidimensional energy landscape. However, with substrate bound, this loop seems to ﬂuctuate collectively with the rest of the protein as catalysis occurs.
The fact that in free CypA all residues within the two groups can be

ﬁtted with single rate constants is indicative of networks with collective motions, but it is not proof. As a direct test of the collective nature of the dynamics and to identify residues that build a common network, the system was locally disturbed by mutations within the network, and the effects of these mutations on the structure and dynamics were examined. We compared mutations in the active site—R55A, R55K and F113W—with amino-acid substitutions within loops adjacent to the active site, H70A and K82A (Fig. 2). These residues were chosen because they are located at different positions within the dynamic network. In addition, Lys 82 is drastically affected by substrate binding5 despite the fact that it is more than 10 A˚ from the substrate in the crystal structure16. Catalytic activities, given as kcat/K m (ref. 17), were severely diminished for the active-site mutants (R55A, 0.09 ^ 0.01%; R55K, 0.1 ^ 0.01%; F113W, 0.03 ^ 0.01%), whereas mutations in the loop did not markedly alter enzymatic activities (H70A, 108 ^ 10%; K82A, 88 ^ 7%). All mutants except H70A had lower substrate afﬁnities, as determined from chemical-shift changes as a function of substrate concentration. Mutation of Arg 55 results in greatly decreased activity because this residue lowers the activation barrier of cis–trans isomerization by decreasing the double-bond character of the prolyl peptide bond through hydrogen bonding to the proline nitrogen.
All mutations cause chemical-shift changes, indicating changes in chemical environment that propagate throughout much of the protein. Moreover, it does not matter from which ‘end’ the system is disturbed; changes are always seen in a common network. By cross-correlating the chemical-shift changes caused by the mutations (Fig. 2d–f), we identiﬁed networks between sites. Remarkably, these networks are similar to those identiﬁed by conformational exchange on the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1c–e).
What is the physical reason for this similarity? 15N relaxation dispersion experiments on all mutants showed not only chemical exchange at a similar set of residues to those in the wild type but also similar exchange rates (kex; Supplementary Table S1). However, the amplitudes of the dispersion proﬁles were changed by constant factors for nearly all amides for each mutant (Fig. 3a). This must reﬂect a shift in relative populations of the two exchanging states because kex remains the same (equation (1)). It also implies that the chemical shifts between the two states (Dq),and hence their structural differences, are identical for wild-type CypA and all CypA mutants (scheme (3)); Supplementary Table S2). Consequently, the dynamics data of the mutants provide direct evidence for the

collectiveness of motions and show that the mutations shift a highly skewed conformational equilibrium that is already present in wildtype CypA. Although most mutations such as H70A and K82A shift the equilibrium towards the minor state, R55A and binding of the inhibitor CsA have the opposite effect. In fact, the equilibrium is so far shifted towards the major conformation in the presence of CsA (more than 98%) that dispersion could be detected only for those amides with exceptionally large chemical-shift differences. A suppression of chemical exchange in CypA by CsA has previously been described qualitatively18. We now state the physical underpinning for this phenomenon: that inhibitor binding shifts a pre-existing equilibrium towards the major conformation. The observed global response to mutagenic perturbations further suggests that the dynamics of the loop region, although exhibiting a different exchange rate, is correlated with the dynamics of the core. Structurally this makes sense because Phe 67 within the loop region is part of a hydrophobic cluster that includes Leu 39, Phe 46, Phe 48 and Ile 78.
To corroborate the collective nature of the conformational transition, we performed an additional type of measurement on all amides. In this experiment, the sign of the changes in 15N chemical shift between the major and minor states were determined for wildtype and mutant forms of CypA by measuring 15N chemical-shift differences, QN, between heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) spectra (Fig. 3b). QN depends on the position in the 15N dimension of the minor form with respect to the major form and on the relative populations19. For all amides with measurable differences, the signs are the same in all CypA forms. The amount of shift for all detected amides is proportional to the population differences determined from the relaxation dispersion experiments (Fig. 3c). This independent experiment further supports our original observation of collective dynamics in the free enzyme. Furthermore, 15N chemical shifts of the minor conformation are not that of an unfolded protein20, revealing the sampling of folded substates.
We have thus shown that the conformational exchange in CypA detected during catalysis already exists in the absence of substrate. In other words, the enzyme’s intrinsic dynamic ‘personality’ is well suited to its catalytic role. Moreover, the frequencies of these intrinsic motions are almost identical in the resting and turning-over enzyme and coincide with the overall turnover number. This correspondence might be of wide-ranging importance, given that in many enzymes, such as triosephosphate isomerase21,22, dihydrofolate reductase23,24,

Although the kex values for all forms are similar, the amplitudes of the dispersion proﬁles, which are proportional to Rex, differ between the forms by a constant factor directly reﬂecting changes in populations of the two exchanging states. b, c, Mutations shift the populations of exchanging states as established by a comparison of chemical shifts of the major conformer in HSQC (darker colour) and HMQC (lighter colour) spectra19, visualized for Gly 74 in R55A (green), wild type (blue) and K82A (orange). b, The less populated state is shifted upﬁeld in the 15N dimension relative to the major conformation for all proteins tested. c, The differences in 15N chemical shift between HSQC and HMQC spectra (QN) (ref. 19) for residues 60–83 are shown for R55A (green), wild type (blue) and K82A (red). The relative changes in QN between the different forms of CypA are proportional to the changes in population19 determined from the dispersion proﬁles in a. Error analysis was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

HIV-1 protease25, RNase A26 and many others14, motions with rates of the same order of magnitude as the turnover number have been detected in their free or ligand-bound state. The similarity of dynamics in free and catalytically active CypA, together with these data on other enzymes, indicates that in enzymes with a fast turnover, catalytic power might be limited by rates of conformational rearrangements.
Our results provide further experimental evidence that the observed ﬂuctuations at equilibrium are a result of a concerted global process. The identiﬁcation of an extended dynamic network in CypA illustrates how proteins can propagate local changes over large distances. Coupled networks in proteins have previously been proposed on the basis of computational techniques3,7,8 and sequencebased methodologies9, and recent computational studies on CypA during substrate turnover have suggested correlated dynamic networks that largely agree with our experimental ﬁndings10.
Although the existence of motions in proteins is a fundamental thermodynamic concept, our results show pre-sampling of conformational substates before catalysis that are harvested for catalytic turnover. This is directly analogous to recent ﬁndings of the role of pre-existing equilibria for allosteric signalling and ligand binding14,27. A picture is therefore emerging in which conformational events that occur during protein function are already present before ligands bind. In contrast to being folded in a single native conformation, proteins have evolved to sample multiple deﬁned conformations that are critical for function. The concept of conformational substates and exploration of the energy landscape of proteins was put forward 30

years ago by Frauenfelder and collaborators6; the challenge now is to understand the connections between structure, energy landscapes, dynamics and function.
METHODS
Materials and enzyme activity. Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed and puriﬁed as described previously5. For CypA containing [13C]methyl-labelled CypA was produced as described previously28.
Unless otherwise noted, NMR samples contained 0.7 mM CypA in 50 mM Na2HPO4 pH 6.5, and 1 mM dithiothreitol with 10% 2H2O. The peptide N-succinyl-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide was used for NMR studies of CypA dynamics during catalysis and for activity assays by the coupled chymotrypsin assay at 10 8C (ref. 17). At least three measurements were used to determine k cat/K m values and their respective uncertainties. For saturated NMR samples 3.2 mM peptide and 3.5 mM CsA were used. NMR spectroscopy and data analysis. All spectra were collected on Varian 600-MHz and 800-MHz spectrometers. Chemical shifts for CypA alone and in the presence of CsA were published previously18. Chemical shifts for CypA in the presence of substrate were determined with substrate titration data and conﬁrmed by three-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy– HSQC, a CBCA(CO)NH and a HNCACB spectrum (where CA is the alpha carbon and CB is the beta carbon).
Unless noted otherwise, all 15N CPMG relaxation data were collected at 10 8C and 600 MHz. This lower temperature was used because of the much higher binding afﬁnity for the substrate than at 25 8C (refs 5, 15). Data were collected on free CypA at 25 8C with protein concentrations of 1 and 2 mM to rule out sample aggregation effects on chemical exchange (Supplementary Fig. S1). Amide spectra were collected with TROSY (transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy)-CPMG sequences13,29, applying 10–14 CPMG ﬁeld strengths

ranging from 50 to 1,000 Hz. Methyl side-chain CPMG pulse sequences13 were performed at 10 8C at 600 and 800 MHz.
Relaxation dispersion data were based on peak intensities and analysed with the generalized Carver–Richard equation for a two-site exchange30 with the use of in-house scripts. For each relaxation dispersion curve two duplicate points were collected and used to estimate the absolute uncertainties together with the signal-to-noise ratio of each individual spectrum. Dispersion curves were then ﬁtted individually to a two-site exchange for all residues exhibiting chemical exchange.
For CypA in the presence of saturating substrate concentration, the individual ﬁts gave exchange rates between 2,400 and 3,000 s21 justifying a global ﬁt. For free CypA, individual ﬁts clustered in two groups with rates in the ranges 900–1,400 s21 for group I and 2,000–3,000 s21 for group II. The separation of residues into these two groups was strongly buttressed by dispersion experiments at 25 8C, at which temperature the difference in rates between the two groups is more pronounced (Supplementary Fig. S2). Residues within those groups were ﬁtted globally. Uncertainties for all global ﬁts were calculated with a jackknife approach (Supplementary Table S1).
The similarity of exchange rates extracted from ﬁts of dispersion proﬁles on a per-residue basis supports a two-state model of exchange. To establish further that this is true we compared a series of point mutants. Changes in global amplitude by constant factors in relaxation dispersion proﬁles for the mutant forms of CypA (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table S3) with nearly identical exchange rates can be interpreted only by a shift in population between two states. Exact absolute populations cannot be determined because the process is in the fast exchange limit for most resonances and the chemical-shift difference is not known. However, data for the wild type and mutants can be ﬁtted only with highly skewed populations (Supplementary Table S2). The observed kex and Rex values deﬁne an upper limit of about 7% for the minor conformation of wildtype CypA because larger populations would yield Dq values (equation (1)) that were so small as to result in unobservable chemical-shift changes in 15N HSQC experiments for the mutants. The result of highly skewed populations is further buttressed by simultaneous ﬁts of [13C]methyl dispersion data at 600 and 800 MHz of residues with exchange in the intermediate time regime (a , 1.5; ref. 14), for which p minor was calculated to be 5%.
HMQC and HSQC spectra were collected at 10 8C and 600 MHz for wild-type and mutant forms of CypA with the use of recently published pulse sequences19. Chemical shifts of the minor enzyme form (q ) Eminor were calculated by using Dq obtained from the dispersion experiments (equation (1)) together with the sign of Dq determined from the HMQC/HSQC experiment. Although the relation between the frequency differences of corresponding correlations in HMQC and HSQC data sets in the general case of an exchanging system is complex (see for example, equation (5) of ref. 19), simulations establish that the correlation between the difference and the population of the minor state, p B, is nearly linear for pB # 0.15. Thus, in an exchange involving highly skewed populations, the relative shifts of HMQC and HSQC correlations as a function of a perturbation that does not change the rate and shift differences between states can be used as a direct measure of changes in p B.
