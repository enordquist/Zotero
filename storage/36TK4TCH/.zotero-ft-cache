Hydrophobic interactions and local dewetting of hydrophobic cavities have been identiﬁed as a key mechanism for ionic gating in biological voltage-gated channels in a cell membrane. Hydrophobic interactions are responsible for rectiﬁcation of the channels, i.e. the ability to transport ions more efﬁciently in one direction compared to the other. We designed single polymer nanopores with a hydrophobic gate on one side in the form of a single layer of C10 or C18 thiols. This nanoporous system behaves like an ionic diode whose direction of rectiﬁcation is regulated by the pH of the electrolyte. In addition, reversible dewetting of the hydrophobic region of the pore was observed as voltage-dependent ion current ﬂuctuations in time between conducting and non-conducting states. The observations are in accordance with earlier molecular dynamics simulations, which predicted the possibility of spontaneous and reversible dewetting of hydrophobic pores.

Introduction
Nanopores with asymmetric, rectifying current–voltage curves have attracted a great deal of scientiﬁc interest.1 A rectifying nanopore in an electrolyte solution transports ionic species more efﬁciently in one direction than in the other, so that it can function as a switch for ions and charged molecules in solution. Ionic rectiﬁers will be the key component for building ionic circuits and lab-on-a-chip systems, for manipulation and signal ampliﬁcation of charged molecules such as proteins and DNA.
A number of rectifying nanoporous systems have already been reported. One class of these nanopores consists of asymmetric structures, such as conically shaped nanopores or glass pipettes with homogeneous surface charges.2–4 Another group of rectifying nanopores contains a junction on the pore walls between two zones that differ in their surface charge densities.5–7 For example, a bipolar diode contains a junction between a positively charged and a negatively charged zone.6 A unipolar diode rectiﬁes the current due to the presence of a zone that is charged and a zone that is neutral.5
The behavior of all nanoporous rectiﬁers reported thus far can be explained exclusively by electrostatic interactions between ions in the solution and charges on the pore walls.8–11 In this manuscript, we present conically shaped nanopores whose one entrance is covered with a hydrophobic layer of thiols which

govern the ionic transport properties of the system. Thus, electrostatic interactions alone cannot explain the behavior of the rectiﬁers presented here. Before introducing the thiols, the pores were cation selective and rectiﬁed the current with preferential direction of cation ﬂow from the narrow opening to the base of the cone; lowering the pH of the background electrolyte to pH 3 eliminated this rectiﬁcation.2,3 The presence of hydrophobic thiols made the rectiﬁcation strongly pH dependent: acidic pHs either reversed the current–voltage curves compared to their behavior at pH 8 or shut down the ion current almost entirely. We think that these effects are related to the additional resistance that the hydrophobic layer presents to ions and water entering the pore, as well as the increased hydrophobicity of the nanopore at pH 3. Both these effects limit the number of ions available for transmembrane transport.
Hydrophobic interactions12 were recently shown to play a key role in the rectiﬁcation and voltage sensitivity (referred to as gating) of biological channels.13 A voltage-gated potassium channel contains a hydrophobic cavity at one opening, while the other opening contains a selectivity ﬁlter to which potassium ions can temporarily bind. A relationship was found between the ability of the hydrophobic cavity to dewet and the number of potassium ions in the selectivity ﬁlter. It was predicted that the presence of ions in the selectivity ﬁlter prevents the hydrophobic cavity from dewetting. In this manuscript, we present a man-made single nanopore system. While the opening diameter of this nanopore is an order of magnitude larger than that of biochannels, its rectifying properties are also governed by an asymmetric hydrophobic region and the number of ions in proximity to this region. Therefore, our system provides evidence that hydrophobic interactions can be used to tune ionic transport over a range of at least several tens of

nanometres. Dewetting of these nanopores is evidenced by the absence of ion current ﬂow and the presence of ion current ﬂuctuations. In our system, pore wetting and dewetting are regulated by the transmembrane potential. The main difference between the previously reported ionic rectiﬁers1–7 and the pores presented here is that the hydrophobic layer in the latter system offers the possibility to tune not only the transport of ions but also of water. Thus, this latter system can be applied as an ondemand drug delivery system, which would allow transport of molecules only when a sufﬁciently large stimulus, e.g. transmembrane potential, is applied. Without the stimulus the pores would be dewetted, preventing any diffusion through the membrane.
Materials and methods
Chemicals (1-decanethiol, 1-octadecanethiol, methanol, and KCl) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Experiments presented in this manuscript were performed with single polymer nanopores prepared by the track-etching technique, as reported previously.2 The technique entails irradiation of 12 mm thick polyethylene terephthalate foils with single energetic heavy ions (11.4 MeV uÀ1), at the linear accelerator UNILAC in the Helmholtzzentrum fu€r Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, Germany, and subsequent etching in 9 M NaOH, performed from one side. The pores had a tapered cone shape whose larger base diameter was between 200 and 820 nm, and the tip diameter was between 10 and 33 nm, as estimated from electrochemical measurements.2
The surface of each single-pore membrane was covered with gold using a Denton Desk IV sputtering system. Three gold layer thicknesses were used, 10 nm, 15 nm and 22.5 nm, as determined by the sputtering time and current. Continuity of all gold layers was conﬁrmed by checking that their electrical resistance was negligible using a multimeter. The thiol layer was deposited by exposing the membrane overnight to 50 mM (C10) or 80 mM (C18) solution of thiols in ethanol. The C18 modiﬁcation was performed at an elevated temperature of 45  C. Successful thiol modiﬁcation of the gold layers was conﬁrmed by measuring their contact angle using a Drop Shape Analysis System DSA100 (Kru€ss GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Contact angles presented in Tables 1 and S2‡ are typically averages of three measurements.

Results and discussions
Fig. 1 presents a series of current–voltage curves for an as prepared polymer nanopore with a tip opening diameter of 24 nm. The nanopore rectiﬁes the current and the degree of rectiﬁcation, calculated as the absolute value of the current at À5 V divided by the current at +5 V, equals $3 in 0.1 M KCl. The degree of rectiﬁcation increases to almost 6 when the concentration decreases to 10 mM KCl, which is expected for a pore of this size.9 As discussed in earlier publications,2,3,9 the ion current is mostly carried by cations, and the higher currents for negative voltages correspond to cations moving from the narrow opening to the base of the cone. At pH 3, where the surface carboxyl groups are protonated, the same nanopore behaves almost like an ohmic resistor. This indicates that the asymmetric structure alone is not sufﬁcient to induce ion current rectiﬁcation.
Covering the nanopore with a 10–25 nm thick gold layer signiﬁcantly increased the degree of ion current rectiﬁcation as well as the current values at negative voltages (Fig. 2). This observation is in accordance with earlier predictions by Vlassiouk et al. and Apel et al.14–17 A gold layer in contact with ClÀ containing electrolyte solution is characterized by a surface charge density up to À0.32 C mÀ2 (ref. 18) which is higher than the intrinsic surface charge density of the etched polymer surface, estimated to be À0.16 C mÀ2.19 As a result of the sharp junction between the two zones with different surface charge densities, the nanopore now behaves more like an ideal diode—that is, current in one direction is almost entirely suppressed. The degree of rectiﬁcation at 4 V in 0.1 M KCl, pH 8, equals 28. While the

Fig. 2 Ion current through a single nanopore before and after depositing a 22.5 nm thick gold layer, followed by chemisorption of C18 hydrophobic thiols. The recordings were performed at two different pH values as indicated in the ﬁgure. This is the same pore that was studied in Fig. 1.

increase in current rectiﬁcation could possibly be explained by a reduction of the pore diameter due to gold layer deposition, we found this to be unlikely. Based on recordings in 1 M KCl, the gold coated pore opening was estimated to be $25 nm, virtually identical to its value before the gold deposition ($24 nm). The several fold increase of current values for negative voltages also contradicts the possibility of a signiﬁcant change of the pore diameter.
Fig. S1† presents numerical modeling of the current–voltage curves of a homogeneously charged nanopore as well as of a nanopore with a junction between two regions with different surface charge densities. The results qualitatively conﬁrmed the increased degree of rectiﬁcation we observed experimentally, as well as the expected changes in ionic concentration close to the gold layer. The modeling was performed by numerically solving the Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations as described before.14,20,21
As the next step, the gold layer was covered with C10 or C18 hydrophobic thiols, which typically led to the degree of rectiﬁcation of the nanopores being reduced at pH 8 (see Fig. 2). Some nanopores with thiols rectiﬁed even less than the bare, as prepared, polymer nanopores (see Fig. S2 in the ESI‡). This observation is also in accordance with earlier numerical predictions, which indicated that a short neutral zone at the narrow opening of a conical nanopore can reduce the degree of rectiﬁcation.14,20 However, we were surprised to see that the current– voltage curves of these nanopores were strongly pH dependent. If only electrostatic interactions were considered, the nanopores with thiols should exhibit a linear current–voltage curve at pH 3, since both the thiol layer and the pore walls are expected to be neutral. In contrast to the predictions, two very different behaviors were observed (Fig. 3). One set of pores stopped

conducting at pH 3, either completely (Fig. 4) or the ion current was signiﬁcantly diminished (pore 2 in Fig. 3). The pores would resume conducting as soon as the pH was increased to pH 8 (Fig. 3–5). The other set of pores did conduct the current at pH 3, but the current–voltage curve reversed so that with the same electrode conﬁguration, currents for positive voltages became higher than currents for negative voltages (Fig. 2, 3 and 5). This behavior was also reversible so that subsequent changes in pH between pH 3 and pH 8 led to switching of the direction of ion

current rectiﬁcation. At pH 3, both of these effects—diminished current and reversed current–voltage curves—were more pronounced and more frequently observed at lower KCl concentrations of 0.1 M and 10 mM KCl. A summary of all nanopores studied is presented in Table S1 in the ESI‡. It is important to mention that all nanopores with C10/C18 hydrophobic layer showed the noted behavior (blockage of the current or inversed current–voltage curve at pH 3) in a consistent and reproducible manner for at least several days, i.e. switching pH between pH 3 and pH 8 always led to the noted type of behavior at pH 3 and current conduction at pH 8. In future studies, we will investigate the relation between pore diameter and thickness of the Au layer, and the type of the ion current change that is observed after chemisorption of hydrophobic molecules.
The only cases where conically shaped polymer nanopores and glass nanopipettes have shown a reverse asymmetric current– voltage curve were observed when the surface charge of the pore walls had been changed from negative to positive.6,22 As a consequence, the positively charged nanopores became anion selective. In order to investigate whether the reversed current– voltage curve of the thiol modiﬁed nanopores (nanopore 1, Fig. 3) is also due to their anion selectivity, we investigated in more detail which are the majority carriers for the current at pH 8 and pH 3. It is important to mention that ionic selectivity of the polymer nanopores considered here indicates only that they may distinguish cations from anions. In contrast, biological systems are much more speciﬁc, so that many channels selectively transport only one type of cation e.g. potassium or calcium ions.23
A convenient way of measuring ionic selectivity of nanopores is based on recording current–voltage curves in a situation when the pore is in contact with an electrolyte concentration gradient.23 Fig. 6 shows current–voltage characteristics of a 22 nm diameter pore with C18 thiols measured at pH 8 and pH 3, with 10 mM KCl placed on the side of the membrane with the small opening, and 0.1 M KCl on the other side. At pH 8, the curve does not go through zero, indicating that the system is ion

selective. This is because an electric potential difference has developed across the membrane to prevent the diffusive movement of cations from the side with a higher KCl concentration to the side with a lower KCl concentration. The potential difference at which the transmembrane current goes to zero is known in the biophysics community as the reversal potential. The value and sign of the potential difference can be related to the ratio of diffusion coefﬁcients of potassium and chloride ions in the pore (DKpore and DCpol re) by the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation:23

The voltage Vrev of À50 mV corresponds to DK/DCl z 26, which conﬁrms cation selectivity of the system at pH 8. The same nanopore in the same KCl concentration gradient condition but at pH 3 is not ion selective, as indicated by the zero reversal potential (see Fig. 6).

The schemes are not to scale: the selectivity ﬁlter of the biochannel has a diameter less than 1 nm, thus one order of magnitude smaller than the opening of polymer pores.

The lack of ionic selectivity at pH 3, together with the strong ion current rectiﬁcation observed for thiol modiﬁed pores, indicates that electrostatic interactions alone cannot describe the observed effects.
We think that in addition to electrostatics, hydrophobic interactions due to the presence of C10/C18 thiols must be considered as well.12 Table 1 shows contact angle measurements on an unmodiﬁed PET membrane as well as with a gold layer, before and after chemisorption of hydrophobic thiols; the measurements were performed in distilled water. Covering the surface with gold increases the contact angle to values close to 90 , and subsequent chemisorption of thiols leads to the formation of a strongly hydrophobic surface with contact angle

up to $115 . It is known that the density of water close to a hydrophobic surface is lower than in the bulk.25,26 Thus, the presence of thiols on one side of the membrane introduces an additional limitation for ions and water trying to enter the pore that is especially pronounced at low pH.
At pH 8, the ionic concentrations in the pore are enhanced due to the presence of the surface charges (Fig. S1‡), which we think can promote wetting of the whole structure.8,21 A similar effect has been observed in molecular dynamics simulations of biological voltage-gated channels: the presence of potassium ions in the selectivity ﬁlter of the channel, located in close proximity to the hydrophobic cavity, prevented the cavity from dewetting.13 We compare this situation to the case of our pores at pH 8

(Fig. 7). The comparison has to be made with caution since the opening of the biological channels is less than 1 nm, while the polymer pores used in our experiments have diameters of $10 nm. The range of hydrophobic interactions is a subject of debate,12 however, our recent experiments with polymer nanopores containing hydrophobic groups on the pore walls suggest that in our system, the range can be as large as several tens of nanometres.27
To support our hypothesis on the effect ions have on pore wetting, we performed contact angle measurements in 0.1 M KCl, pH 3 and pH 8, on an etched PET surface, as well as with a gold layer, before and after chemisorption of thiols. The results are summarized in Table S2‡. For the polymer surface as well as the gold layer with C18 thiols, we have observed a consistent increase in contact angle at the acidic pH, compared to pH 8.
When the polymer pore is in contact with pH 3, ionic concentrations in the pore drop to the bulk values. Thus, the hydrophobic region with C10/C18 thiols is in contact with lower ionic concentrations than at pH 8 which, according to our hypothesis, favors dewetting. This situation would be similar to the case of the voltage-gated channel in which the selectivity ﬁlter did not contain ions, and the hydrophobic cavity was more prone to dewet (Fig. 7).
With positive potentials at the base of the cone, protons and potassium ions get transported from the base of the cone towards the narrow opening, while the chloride ions enter from the hydrophobic narrow opening of the pore. Protons have a significantly higher mobility than potassium and chloride, thus the current due to protons can be very high. For negative voltages however, protons and potassium ions have to enter the pore from the narrow side, which limits the number of passing ions. As a result, currents recorded for this voltage polarity are lower.
In order to provide additional evidence for the importance of hydrophobic interactions in determining the ionic transport of the system, we searched for experimental conditions under which dewetting of the pore could be observed as a non-conducting state of the device. According to earlier molecular dynamics simulations, a hydrophobic nanopore can undergo dynamic and spontaneous dewetting due to water evaporation.28–31 It has been predicted that it is more thermodynamically favorable for water in a hydrophobic nanopore to exist in the vapor phase rather

than the liquid phase. The non-conducting state observed with some of our C10 and C18 modiﬁed pores (e.g. Fig. 4) suggests the possibility of water evaporation in the hydrophobic region of our pores. In order to observe the absence of ion transport, it is sufﬁcient for just a small, nanoscopic region of the pore to undergo dewetting, as predicted by molecular dynamics simulations.32–34 The zero current state for some pores occurred only in a ﬁnite voltage range so that the pores would open up for ionic transport when a sufﬁciently high transmembrane potential was applied.
Earlier experiments with nanopores whose entire pore walls were modiﬁed with hydrophobic groups indicated that wetting/ dewetting could indeed be controlled by the transmembrane potential.27,35 At low voltages, the pores would stay primarily in their closed state, while higher voltages would open them for ionic transport. At intermediate voltages, the pores would ﬂuctuate between conducting and non-conducting states. The low conductance state of the pores was interpreted as a pore or its section being ﬁlled with water vapor.
A similar effect has been observed with several polymer pores that contained a hydrophobic layer of C10 or C18 thiols at their narrow entrance (Table S1‡). This observation suggests that already a very thin hydrophobic layer can induce formation of water vapor, so that at low voltages the pores do not conduct any ion current or the conductance is signiﬁcantly diminished.
Fig. 8 and 9 show examples of voltage-dependent ion current ﬂuctuations and switching between conducting and non-conducting states. Histograms of ion current values (Fig. 8) conﬁrm existence of these conductance states. Note that the pore shown in Fig. 9 started to conduct ion current at voltages that are signiﬁcantly lower than the threshold values in the recordings shown in Fig. 4 and 8. Threshold voltages for other examined pores are shown in Table S1 in the ESI‡. In future studies we will investigate in detail the relation between pore opening diameter, thickness of the hydrophobic layer, and the voltage that opens the structures for ionic transport.
Higher voltage increases the time a pore stays in the open (conducting) state, and ﬁnally, for a sufﬁciently high value of voltage, the pore stays open. The system is reversible so that lowering the voltage stops ion transport through the pore once again. Power spectral analysis of the ion current ﬂuctuations did

not reveal any dominant frequencies, but rather a power law dependence of the power spectrum magnitude on frequency. Our future analysis will focus on determining the dependence of the power spectrum magnitude and ﬁnding the range of the power law scaling with voltage.
In the pores with a thin hydrophobic layer, voltage-induced opening and closing of the pore were more frequently observed at pH 3 than at pH 8, which we believe is related to the reduced ionic concentrations in the pore under acidic conditions that favor dewetting (Fig. 7).
Conclusions
Our experiments with single nanopores whose entrance was decorated with hydrophobic groups indicate that hydrophobic interactions provide yet another way to control transport of ions through nanopores. Previous nanopore studies focused primarily on regulating ionic transport by electrostatic interactions of the transported species with the pore walls. In this manuscript we have shown that the presence of a hydrophobic layer at the pore entrance introduces an additional obstacle for ions and water passing through the pore, which can induce ion current rectiﬁcation. The ionic transport of the hydrophobic pores is also strongly dependent on the electrolyte pH. Our experiments have indicated that a relatively short hydrophobic region is sufﬁcient for hydrophobic gating to occur i.e. voltage-induced opening and closing of the pore. There is a threshold value of the voltage below which no ion current is recorded; only higher voltages made the pore conductive. The transition between the non-conducting and conducting states is reversible. In the future studies, we will investigate whether the hydrophobic modulation of ionic transport is dependent on the level of hydrophobicity of the transported ions. This will be important for applying these pores in drug delivery systems for various molecules.
