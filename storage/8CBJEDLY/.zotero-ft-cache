ABSTRACT All organisms respond to various forms of stress, including heat shock. The heat shock response has been universally conserved from bacteria to humans. In Escherichia coli the heat shock response is under the positive transcriptional control of the o32 polypeptide and involves transient acceleration in the rate of synthesis of a few dozen genes. Three of the heat shock genes-dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE-are special because mutations in any one of these lead to constitutive levels of heat shock gene expression, implying that their products negatively autoregulate their own synthesis. The DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE proteins have been known to function in various biological situations, including bacteriophage A replication. Here, we report the formation of an ATP hydrolysis-dependent complex
of DnaJ, g32, and DnaK proteins in vitro. This DnaJ-og32-
DnaK complex has been seen under different conditions, including glycerol gradient sedimentation and co-immunoprecipitation. The DnaK and DnaJ proteins in the presence of ATP can interfere with the efficient binding of a32 to the RNA polymerase core, and are capable of disrupting a preexisting
g32-RNA polymerase complex. Our results suggest a possible
mechanism for the autoregulation of the heat shock response.
All organisms respond to environmental stresses, such as heat and ethanol, by the rapid and transient acceleration in the rate of synthesis of a group of proteins collectively called the heat shock proteins (for reviews see refs. 1-4). Escherichia coli possesses approximately 20 known heat shock genes whose expression is positively regulated by the oa32 polypeptide (the rpoH gene product) at the transcriptional level. The o32 polypeptide is extremely unstable in vivo, with a half-life of 1 min at normal temperatures, its intracellular levels usually correlating with the magnitude of the heat shock response (refs. 5-7, reviewed in refs. 2 and 8). The heat shock respor .e is negatively autoregulated, since mutations in the dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE heat shock genes lead to an overproduction of the heat shock proteins. Such an overexpression of the heat shock response is due in part to a
stabilization of o:32 polypeptide in these genetic backgrounds (6, 7, 9).
The major heat shock protein DnaK has been extremely conserved during evolution. It is 50% identical at the amino acid sequence level to the eukaryotic Hsp7O protein. DnaK can bind to various unfolded polypeptides, such as denaturated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, as well as seemingly folded polypeptides such as E. coli GrpE, a32, phage A P, and the human antitumor p53 protein (10-16). Such binding is disrupted in the presence of ATP. In addition, overproduction of DnaK aids the translocation of an export-deficient MalB-LacZ hybrid protein (17), and DnaK/DnaJ overproduction can substitute for some of the functions for the missing SecB protein (18). DnaK, also referred to as a

'"chaperone" (19), usually acts together with two other heat
shock proteins, DnaJ and GrpE, to constitute a "chaperone machine" (20).
The DnaJ protein is another example of a heat shock protein that has been extensively conserved in evolution (21). Recently, it has been shown that E. coli DnaJ protein can suppress the import defect into the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of YDJ1-defective yeast mutants (22), demonstrating a functional conservation throughout evolution. DnaJ and GrpE work synergistically with DnaK in the replication of bacteriophages A and P1 (23-25). Part of the role of DnaJ protein is to target both the phage A P and RepA replication proteins for DnaK action (26-28). In the case of P1 replication the formation of the DnaJ-RepA protein complex is necessary for the subsequent action of DnaK, resulting in the monomerization of RepA protein dimers (26). DnaJ and GrpE also interact with DnaK directly. The GrpE protein forms a stable ATP-sensitive complex with DnaK, whereas GrpE and DnaJ together greatly stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK (29).
We have previously shown that purified DnaK but not DnaK756 mutant protein interacts with o.32 and that this interaction is sensitive to ATP hydrolysis (11). Recently, Gamer et al. (14) showed, using crude extracts and affinity chromatography, that DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE proteins also interact with or32 transcription factor. In this work we show that purified DnaK and DnaJ proteins form a stable complex
with o.32 in the presence ofATP. Such an association prevents
v32 from binding to RNA polymerase. In addition, DnaK and DnaJ can also actively "strip" vo32 from its complex with RNA polymerase.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein Purification. DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, a32, and RNA polymerase were purified according to refs. 11, 30, and 31.
The purity of all enzymes was >90% except o70 (-75%).
Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bio-Rad assay and the molar ratio was determined on the basis that all proteins are monomers except DnaJ (dimer).
Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation. Reaction mixtures (60 ,l) in buffer A (40 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6/100 mM NaCl/1 mM dithiothreitol/5 mM MgCl2/0.1 mM EDTA) were assembled on ice. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37°C and then loaded directly onto a 3.2-ml linear 15-35% (vol/vol) glycerol gradient in buffer A and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 24 hr at 2°C in a Beckman SW60 rotor. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by SDS/PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining, silver staining, and/or Western blot analysis with antibodies to o,32 and 125I-labeled staphylococcal protein A or a chemiluminescent detection system using Lumigen PPD as a substrate (Boehringer Mannheim).

RNA polymerase, the glycerol gradient was increased to 20-40%o (vol/vol) and the centrifugation time was lowered to 20 hr. Where indicated, ATP was used at 1 mM in the reaction mixtures and at 100 ,uM throughout the gradient.
Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments. The reaction mixtures in buffer A were assembled on ice and then incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Ten microliters ofpolyclonal anti-DnaK rabbit serum was added and the mixtures were incubated for 1 hr on ice. Forty microliters of a 1:1 (vol/vol) mixture of protein A-agarose in buffer B (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2/150 mM NaCl/5 mM EDTA/1% Triton X-100) was added. After an additional 30-min incubation on ice the protein A beads were washed five times with 500 ,ul of buffer B. The or32 protein that associated with protein A-agarose was detected by SDS/PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis with polyclonal antibodies to o-32 as described above.
RESULTS The g32 Transcription Factor Interacts with DnaJ Protein. Because we had previously demonstrated that the DnaK chaperone protein can form a weak, ATP hydrolysissensitive complex with oJ32 (11), we investigated whether the DnaJ chaperone can also interact with cr32. Such a possible interaction between the DnaJ and ar32 protein was investigated by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Under such conditions, DnaJ is known to sediment as a dimer (30), while cr32 sediments as a monomer (11). When a32 was preincubated with DnaJ (approximate molar ratio 1:1) for 10 min at 37°C and the mixture was sedimented in a glycerol gradient, approximately 75% ofthe a32 protein was found in a complex with DnaJ (Fig. 1). The DnaJ-cr32 complex, judging from its sedimentation behavior, as well as the separation of the proteins by SDS/PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining, most likely consists of a monomer of o32 and a dimer of DnaJ. This complex formed equally well in the presence and absence of ATP (results not shown). The interaction between a32 and DnaJ has been additionally demonstrated by the following observations: (i) o-32 protein binds to a DnaJ affinity column, and (ii) part of DnaJ

protein copurifies with or32 during Q-Sepharose chromatog-
raphy (results not shown). Our results with purified proteins
confirm and extend those of Gamer et al. (14), who demon-
strated a a32-DnaJ interaction by using histidine-tagged a32
bound to a nickel affinity column and passing crude extracts
over it.
Formation of the DnaJ-cr32-DnaK Complex Is ATP Depen-
dent. Next, we determined the relative affinity of o-32 for
DnaK or DnaJ. In the absence of ATP, when the molar ratio of DnaK, DnaJ, and or32 was approximately 1:1:1 in the incubation mixture, the majority of or32 was found in a
complex with DnaJ only (Fig. 2). This result demonstrates that DnaJ binds to ao32 much better than DnaK does. This
conclusion is consistent with the observation that, when the
amount of DnaK in the preincubation mixture was increased to 10-fold above that of o.32 and DnaJ, the formation of the DnaJ-or32-DnaK complex was readily seen. However, as expected, the bulk of DnaK sedimented in a position characteristic of that of a DnaK monomer (results not shown).
A surprising observation made during the course of this work was that the presence of ATP greatly stimulated the quantitative formation of DnaJ-cr32-DnaK complex even when the molar ratio of the three proteins was 1:1:1 (Fig. 2). For the efficient formation of this complex, the presence of ATP is absolutely required; i.e., when ATP was replaced either by its nonhydrolyzable analogs adenosine 5'-l,3, imido]triphosphate and adenosine 5'-[y-thioltriphosphate or by ADP, the DnaJ-or32-DnaK complex did not form. The DnaJ-cr32-DnaK complex must be fairly stable, since it is seen after a 24-hr centrifugation and persists at any concentration of ATP used in the gradient (ranging from 0 to 1 mM ATP; results not shown). In a control experiment, we were unable to demonstrate a direct physical interaction between DnaK and DnaJ under any of our experimental conditions.
When the third heat shock protein, GrpE, was included in the reaction mixture the extent of formation of the DnaJo'32-DnaK complex in the presence of ATP was essentially the same as that seen without GrpE. Furthermore, the GrpE protein was never seen to associate with the DnaJ-or32-DnaK complex (results not shown).
To further confi-m the validity of the results obtained by sedimentation analysis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments as well. Using anti-DnaK antibodies, we were able to efficiently co-immunoprecipitate o,32 with DnaK protein only when either DnaJ and ATP was present or DnaJ

DnaK and DnaJ proteins in equimolar amounts with a32, in
the absence of ATP, did not result in the efficient co-

DnaJ-c732-DnaK complex was demonstrated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, as well as sizing column chromatography (results not shown).
eo Does Not Form a Stable Complex with DnaJ and DnaK. To determine whether the DnaJ-0.32-DnaK complex is specific for 0.32 we performed a series of experiments with the canonical E. coli a factor, 0.70. No evidence for a DnaJ-070, DnaK-o.70, or DnaJ-a070-DnaK complex could be seen after a 10-min preincubation at 37°C and glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4). Furthermore, in a competition experiment we established that the presence of a70 did not appreciably interfere with the formation of the DnaJ-0.32-DnaK complex
(Fig. 4).
DnaK and DnaJ Compete with RNA Polymerase for Binding to J32. To better understand the mechanism of heat shock autoregulation, we then asked whether the DnaJ and DnaK proteins can compete with the RNA polymerase core for a032 binding. In all cases examined (DnaK, DnaJ, and ATP or

DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and ATP), 0.32 was preferentially associated with the RNA polymerase core rather than with DnaK or DnaJ-i.e., after glycerol gradient centrifugation, less than 20% of o.32 was found to be in the DnaJ-a32-DnaK complex, whereas the rest cosedimented with the RNA polymerase
core (results not shown).
In vivo, other o factors may compete with 0,32 for binding to the RNA polymerase core. Therefore, we included 0.70 in our experiments to determine whether its presence can influence the fraction of o.32 that partitions with either RNA polymerase core or DnaK/DnaJ. In a control experiment when only o.70, (732, and RNA polymerase core were present,
approximately 90% of a32 was associated with RNA polymerase (Fig. 5). The remaining o.32 sedimented as a free monomer near the top of the gradient. However, when DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and ATP were also included in the preincubation mixture, the majority of o.32 was detected in the DnaJ-a32-DnaK complex (Fig. 5). The formation of this
complex did not depend on the order of protein additioni.e., when RNA polymerase core was preincubated with 0.32
and 0.70 and then DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE were added, the DnaJ-0.32-DnaK complex formed equally efficiently.
In all such experiments the combined presence of DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and ATP resulted in the removal of more than 50% of 0.32 from the RNA polymerase core. Although the
precise role, if any, that GrpE plays in this 0.32 release/
sequestration reaction is not known, it was nevertheless included, because its presence resulted in a more quantitative

To confirm the results obtained by the glycerol gradient centrifugation method, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-DnaK antibodies. When DnaK and (732 were the only proteins present in the reaction mixture only a limited amount of o,32 co-immunoprecipitated with DnaK (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the addition of RNA polymerase core with or without o70 abolished the DnaK-o32 interaction as judged by the fact that no detectable (732 was co-immunoprecipitated. However, it was possible to restore efficient co-immunoprecipitation of o-32 with DnaK by adding either DnaJ (partial restoration; notice that DnaK and DnaJ are used in molar excess) or both DnaJ and ATP (Fig. 6). The presence of GrpE protein in the reaction mixture did not affect the extent of co-immunoprecipitation of a32 with DnaK
(Fig. 6).
DISCUSSION
The heat shock response in E. coli is known to be under the positive transcriptional regulation of the (732 transcription factor (reviewed in refs. 2 and 8). It is known that three heat shock proteins-DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE-autoregulate the heat shock responses, since mutations in their corresponding genes often lead to the overproduction of heat shock proteins. This is probably due to the fact that the normally extremely short half-life of o(32 ('-60 sec) is dramatically stabilized in dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE mutant backgrounds, and the levels of o32 correlate with the extent of heat shock gene expression, at least at 42°C (2, 6-9).
It was previously shown that the DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperone proteins act together in many biological processes as well (6, 23). In this paper we report on the formation of a complex of DnaJ, (732, and DnaK, which is capable of the sequestration of the (732 transcription factor from RNA polymerase. Recently, Hoffmann et al. (28) reported the formation of an analogous complex of A P, DnaK, and DnaJ
in the presence of ATP. Also, Langer et al. (32) reported that the presence of Mg2+ATP and DnaJ alters the manner by which DnaK interacts with unfolded rhodanese protein. However, in contrast to the results of both Hoffmann et al. (28) and Langer et al. (32), in our system the GrpE protein neither interferes with nor disrupts a preexisting DnaJsubstrate-DnaK complex. If anything, in the presence of GrpE, the sequestration of (732 from RNA polymerase by

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 (1993)
DnaK and DnaJ is more effective. In agreement with this differential role of GrpE in our system, it has been recently shown that in the presence of GrpE, DnaK exhibits a much higher affinity for the DnaJ-A P complex than for A P alone (27). A similar mechanism may be operating in our system as well-i.e., in the presence of GrpE, DnaK may exhibit a much higher affinity for the o-32-DnaJ complex than for any other protein present in the reaction mixture. A likely possibility is that GrpE interacts with DnaK, thus changing its conformation and enabling it to efficiently bind to the DnaJv.32 complex, as in the case of A P protein (27). Consistent with such a potential role ofGrpE, mutations in the grpEgene result in a constitutive induction of the heat shock response in E. coli (6).
Normally, DnaK protein binds to one of its substrates, such as A P, A 0, human p53, or unfolded bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and releases them after ATP hydrolysis. However, in the case of the DnaJ-o-32-DnaK complex, the DnaJ protein, which is part of the complex, must also change the manner by which DnaK interacts with oa32, since in the absence of DnaJ the interaction between o-32 and DnaK is disrupted in the presence ofATP (11, 14). The DnaJ-o32-DnaK complex, once formed in the presence of ATP, is stable and can be isolated after sedimentation in the absence or presence of ATP. When a 10-fold excess of DnaK was used in the absence of ATP, a DnaJ-o-32-DnaK complex was readily seen. This result can be explained in two different ways: (i) there is no change in the affinity of DnaK for the DnaJ-or32 complex, and the observed result is simply due to a mass effect, and (ii) there exists a minor DnaK form (perhaps due to the hydrolysis of contaminating traces of ATP) with a high affinity for the DnaJ-o32 complex. Our results do not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities. ATP hydrolysis is not always needed to stabilize a DnaJ-substrate-DnaK complex, as the case of the P1 bacteriophage RepA protein exemplifies. Wickner et al. (26) have shown that the DnaJ-RepA complex is acted upon by DnaK in the presence of ATP, resulting not only in its disruption but in the actual monomerization of RepA. However, a stable DnaJ-RepA-DnaK complex is never observed (26).
Recently, Sherman and Goldberg (33) showed that DnaK protein is associated at high temperature with a rapidly degraded mutant alkaline phosphatase protein, PhoA61, and that various mutations in dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE differentially affect its degradation rate. Perhaps the binding of o32 to the DnaJ and DnaK proteins makes it a better substrate for proteases (2, 8). It is possible that in vivo GrpE protein acts at this step, by allowing the transfer of o32 to a protease system(s) analogous to its function in the transfer of unfolded rhodanese from DnaK/DnaJ to the GroEL/GroES chaperonin system (32).
Our work with purified proteins has confirmed and extended our previous findings (11), as well as those of Gamer et al. (14). The major conclusion of our work is that DnaK and DnaJ proteins form a very stable complex with (32 transcription factor, especially in the presence of ATP. The DnaK and DnaJ proteins in the presence of ATP have been shown to interfere with the efficient binding of oa32 to RNA polymerase core and to actively disrupt a preexisting o-32-RNA polymerase complex. This finding correlates with the observation made in vivo by Straus et al. (34), namely that the activity of (732 protein is reduced under conditions where there is an excess of heat shock proteins. Our work supports the previously suggested model of regulation of the heat shock response (8, 35) and helps explain why mutations in either dnaK or dnaJ lead to high constitutive levels of heat shock
gene expression (6, 7).
