The J-domain is a highly conserved domain found in all members of the DnaJ family of molecular chaperones. The three-dimensional structure of a recombinant, uniformly 15N-labeled 77-residue polypeptide containing the complete J-domain from human Hsp40 (HDJ-1) has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in solution. On the basis of 876 upper distance constraints derived from nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) and 173 dihedral angle constraints, a group of 20 conformers representing the solution structure of the HDJ-1 J-domain was computed with the program DIANA and energy-minimized with the program OPAL. The average of the pairwise root-mean-square deviations of the individual NMR conformers relative to the mean coordinates for the backbone atoms N, Ca and C' of residues 4 to 54 and 4 to 66 is 0.88 and 0.99 Å respectively. The molecular architecture includes four helices composed of residues 5 to 9, 15 to 28, 40 to 54 and 60 to 66. A turn composed of residues 10 to 14 links helices I and II, and a loop composed of residues 29 to 39 containing a highly conserved tripeptide HPD (residues 31 to 33) connects the antiparallel helices II and III. The tertiary fold formed by helix Iturn-helix II-loop-helix III forms a closed structural core; the less deﬁned helix IV stands away from the core of the domain. The side-chains of the tripeptide HPD extend out from the core of the structure in the opposite direction from helix IV. The structure supports the hypothesis that the highly conserved tripeptide could play a key role in the interaction of Hsp40 with the molecular chaperone, Hsp70.

Introduction
Molecular chaperones of the DnaJ (Hsp40) family are found ubiquitously in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and play diverse roles in many cellular processes such as translation, translocation and protein folding (reviewed by Cyr et al., 1994). In addition to its intrinsic chaperone activity, DnaJ is able to interact directly with and stimulate the ATPase activity of the Escherichia coli Hsp70 homologue DnaK (Liberek et al., 1991; Langer et al., 1992; Szabo et al., 1994). DnaJ thus cooperates with DnaK in protein folding and also in mediating assembly and disassembly of macromolecule complexes. Three human DnaJ homologues have been identiﬁed, Hsp40 (HDJ-1) (Ohtsuka, 1993), HDJ2 (Chellaiah et al., 1993; Oh et al., 1993) and

HSJ-1 (Cheetham et al., 1992) of which HDJ-1 has been the most extensively characterized. Like DnaJ itself, HDJ-1 interacts with Hsp70 and can stimulate its ATPase activity (Freeman et al., 1995; Ho¨ hfeld et al., 1995). HDJ-1 cooperates with the constitutively expressed Hsp70 homologue Hsc70 to mediate efﬁcient refolding of ﬁreﬂy luciferase in an ATP-dependent reaction (Freeman et al., 1995). Studies using in vitro translation systems have shown that HDJ-1 is associated with a high molecular weight complex that contains translating nascent polypeptide chains, Hsc70 and the Hsp60 homologue TriC (Frydman et al., 1994). Immunedepletion of this chaperone from the translation lysate markedly decreases the efﬁciency of folding of newly translated luciferase. Furthermore, HDJ-1 stimulates the association between Hsc70 and the newly discovered co-chaperone and ATPase regulator, Hip, in a reaction which is dependent on the presence of Mg-ATP (Ho¨ hfeld et al., 1995). Thus, HDJ-1 plays an important role in protein translation and folding in eukaryotes as well as in the regulation of Hsp70 function.
DnaJ homologues are highly diverse at the primary sequence level but tend to share various combinations of at least three domains (Cyr et al., 1994). These three domains appear to correlate with various biochemical functions of the protein (Szabo et al., 1995). The most highly conserved domain, the J-domain, is present in all members of the DnaJ family and consists of approximately 70 residues. The other two domains, a glycine/phenylalaninerich sequence and a cysteine-rich sequence with homology to zinc-ﬁnger domains (Szabo et al., 1995) are less well conserved. Mutagenesis of a highly-conserved tripeptide (His-Pro-Asp) within the J-domain completely abolishes the ability of E. coli DnaJ to stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK and abrogates its ability to cooperate with DnaK in both refolding and assembly reactions (Wall et al., 1994). Thus, it has been proposed that

the J-domain plays a critical role in DnaJ-DnaK protein-protein interactions and presumably also in the interaction between HDJ-1 and Hsc70. The backbone fold of the J-domain of E. coli DnaJ has been reported (Szyperski et al., 1994; Hill et al., 1995). We present here the ﬁrst three-dimensional structure of the J-domain of a eukaryotic DnaJ (Hsp40) family member, HDJ-1. The critical HPD tripeptide is present on a loop of the structure. Intriguingly, in a group of 20 conformers, the side-chains of the histidine and aspartate residues are always oriented away from the structural core of the domain. The implications of this side-chain orientation with respect to interactions with Hsc70 are discussed.
Results and Discussion
Resonance assignments and identiﬁcation of secondary structure
Nearly complete sequence-speciﬁc 1H resonance assignments for the HDJ-1 J-domain (Figure 1) were obtained from the 2D homonuclear spectra using the unlabeled sample following the conventional strategy of a combination of through-bond (2QF-COSY and clean-TOCSY) and through-space (NOESY) connectivities (Billeter et al., 1982; Wagner & Wu¨ thrich, 1982; Wider et al., 1982; Wu¨ thrich, 1986). However, for Leu10 and Ala11, Ala22 and Tyr23, Ile47 and Ala48, Tyr51 and Asp52, the amide proton resonances of the two neighboring amino acid residues had virtually identical chemical shifts which generated ambiguities in the assignments. Similarly, assignment ambiguities arose for Tyr4 due to the degenerate chemical shifts of its amide proton and d-proton. The 3D 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY and the gradient-enhanced 2D [15N, 1H] HSQC spectrum using the subsequently prepared uniformly 15N-labeled domain resolved

Filled squares above the sequence identify the locations of amide protons that exchange sufﬁciently slowly to be observed in a TOCSY spectrum recorded immediately after dissolving the lyophilized protein in 2H2O. For the sequential NOE connectivities daN (dad for Xxx-Pro dipeptide segments), dbN and dNN, thick and thin bars indicate strong and weak NOE intensities, respectively; medium-range NOEs are indicated by lines connecting the two residues related by the NOE.

these ambiguities by additional dispersion of the nitrogen-attached protons based on the 15N chemical shifts. The strip plot taken from the 3D 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY (Figure 2) shows the unambiguous sequential connectivities obtained for residues Phe44 through Val53.
Overall, the proton-bearing backbone 15N chemical shifts were obtained for all residues with the sole exception of the amino-terminal residue Met0. The side-chain 15N chemical shifts were identiﬁed for all Asn and Gln residues, and for the e nitrogen atoms of Arg12 and Arg60. For proton resonances, assignments of the non-labile protons in the HDJ-1 J-domain were complete, with the exception of Met0, Pro32, Phe44 and side-chain protons of Arg and Lys residues. Among the labile protons, individual assignments were obtained for all side-chain-NH2 groups of Asn and Gln residues. Only part of the labile side-chain protons of Arg and Lys residues could be observed. The sequential and intermediate range NOE correlation data observed for backbone NH, aH and bH protons and

the secondary structural elements for the HDJ-1 J-domain are summarized in Figure 1.
Two parallel sets of chemical shifts were observed for Asp3, Phe63, Arg65, Tyr66, Glu68, Glu69, and Gly70. In most cases the chemical shift differences between the two sets of lines were within 0.05 ppm with the exception of the amide proton of Glu69 where the difference was 0.43 ppm. A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the presence of multiple disulﬁde bonds formed between the C-terminal residue Cys76, which was introduced during the cloning process, and the reducing agent DTT.
Collection of structural constraints and structure calculation
NOE upper distance constraints were collected mainly from two homonuclear NOESY spectra recorded in H2O or 2H2O and supplemented by the heteronuclear 3D 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY in H2O to evaluate the overlapped peaks in the

homonuclear spectra. All three spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 80 ms (see Materials and Methods for details). The NOE cross-peak volumes determined with the program XEASY (Bartels et al., 1995) were calibrated to establish the corresponding proton-proton distance constraints (Gu¨ ntert et al., 1991b). The program ASNO was used to check constraints with consistent violations in the preliminary structures for possibly incorrect NOESY cross-peak assignments or integrations (Gu¨ ntert et al., 1993). In total, 1187 NOEs were assigned in the three NOESY spectra. In addition, 65 3JHNa coupling constants were measured by inverse Fourier transformation of the in-phase multiplets in the gradient enhanced 2D [15N, 1H] HSQC spectrum (Szyperski et al., 1992), and 38 3Jab coupling constants representing unique rotamer states (Nagayama & Wu¨ thrich, 1981) were measured from an E. COSY spectrum recorded in 2H2O. After the initial processing with HABAS (Gu¨ ntert et al., 1989) and DIANA (Gu¨ ntert et al., 1991a), the input data for the DIANA structure calculations consisted of 876 relevant NOE upper distance limits on proton-proton distances and 173 constraints on the dihedral angles f, c and x1. Stereospeciﬁc assignments for 32 non-degenerate bCH2, gCH2 and dCH2 proton pairs, and two pairs of isopropyl methyl groups (Table 1) were obtained with the programs HABAS and GLOMSA (Gu¨ ntert et al., 1991a,b). For all three NH2 groups of Gln and Asn residues individual assignments were deter-

mined from the relative intensity of the NOEs to the nearest CH2 group in the covalent structure. The sequence and range distributions of the NOE distance constraints are shown in Figure 3. The substantial number of medium-range and longrange NOE distance constraints indicated that the structure of the HDJ-1 J-domain would be well determined by NMR data. The lack of NOE distance constraints for the N-terminal and the C-terminal segments (Figure 3) indicated that the conformation of the two chain termini would not be well determined after the structure calculation.
The ﬁnal DIANA calculations were started with 50 randomized conformers. One REDAC cycle (Gu¨ ntert & Wu¨ thrich, 1991) was applied, followed by a computation at the maximum target level using only the original 173 dihedral angle constraints obtained with HABAS. Among the 50 computed conformers, the best 20 solutions had values of the DIANA target function in the range 0.94 to 2.11 A˚ 2 (Table 1). For each of these 20 DIANA conformers, restrained energy-minimization with the program OPAL yielded a low-energy conformation with further reduced maximum constraint violations and only a small increase in the sum of constraint violations (Table 1). The pairwise r.m.s.d. values of the 20 conformers relative to their mean before and after energy minimization were virtually unchanged, independent of the atoms selected for the r.m.s.d. calculation (Table 1).

(a) Number of NOE distance constraints per residue, n, versus the amino acid sequence. The constraints are speciﬁed as follows: black, intra-residual; crosshatched, constraints between protons in sequentially neighboring residues; vertically hatched, mediumrange constraints between protons located in residues separated by two to ﬁve positions along the sequence; white, all longer-range constraints. (b) Number of NOE constrains, n, as a function of the separation along the amino acid sequence of the residues containing the hydrogen atoms between which the NOE is observed. Black, intra-residual; crosshatched, sequential NOEs (since these plots would go off-scale, the number of intra-residual and sequential NOEs are indicated at the top of the Figure); vertically hatched, medium-range NOEs (two to ﬁve residues separation); white, long-range NOEs (>ﬁve residues separation).
The NMR solution structure of the HDJ-1 J-domain
Figure 4 shows a superposition for the polypeptide backbone of the 20 DIANA conformers of the HDJ-1 J-domain after restrained energy minimization. The two terminal residues were unstructured as expected due to the lack of NMR data. The deﬁned part of the domain contains residues 4 to 66 which comprise four helices composed of residues 5 to 9, 15 to 28, 40 to 54 and 60 to 66. Helix I from residues 5 to 9 is a 310-helix since O'-HN hydrogen bonds between residues 5 to 8 and 6 to 9 were observed. The other three are a-helical helices. A

pentapeptide (residues 10 to 14) forms a turn

linking helix I to helix II. The axis of helix I forms

an angle of about 45° with respect to the axis of

helix II and crosses the axis of helix II at a point

between the second and third turn. Helix II is

connected by a loop composed of residues 29 to 39

leading to helix III, and the two helices are oriented

in an anti-parallel fashion with respect to one

another. The tertiary fold helix I-turn-helix II-loop-

helix III forms the structural core of the HDJ-1

J-domain. The less well-deﬁned helix IV is

connected to helix III by a turn composed of

residues 55 to 59 and is oriented approximately

orthogonal to helix III, facing away from the core of

the domain (Figure 4).

A characterization of the local features of the

NMR structure of the HDJ-1 J-domain is presented

in Figure 5 which shows the global displacements

between the mean atom coordinates and the

individual conformers. The backbone atoms of

helices I, II and III are deﬁned precisely whereas the

turn linking helix I to helix II and the loop

connecting helix II and helix III are less well-

characterized. The fourth helix is apparently more

disordered. A further assessment of the precision of

different segments is provided by the global

r.m.s.d. values (Table 1). The value of the average

r.m.s.d. calculated for the backbone atoms N, Ca

and C' of helix I (residues 5 to 9), helix II (residues

15 to 28) and helix III (residues 40 to 54) is

0.56(20.12) A˚ representative of a high-quality

NMR structure determination. A nearly identical

value is obtained when the 15 best-deﬁned

side-chains (listed in Table 1; for these residues the

global

side-chain

displacement,

D , sc glob

is

less

than

1.47 A˚ ) are also considered. The r.m.s.d value of

0.88 A˚ for the backbone atoms of residues 4 to 54

indicates that the turn (linking helix to helix 2) and

the loop (connecting helix II to helix III) are

less-deﬁned. Addition of residues 55 to 66 results

in an increased r.m.s.d. value of 1.01 A˚ for the

backbone atoms of residues 4 to 66, highlighting the

thermally dynamic state of helix IV.

A direct visualization of the molecular core of the

HDJ-1 J-domain is presented in Figure 6, represent-

ing a superposition of 20 conformers containing the

entire backbone from residues 4 to 54 and includ-

ing the 15 well-deﬁned side-chains located in the

interior of the domain. As is generally observed in

globular proteins in solution, the surface side-

chains (Figure 5(b)) are distinctly less well-deﬁned

by the NMR data, which is also manifested in a

signiﬁcant increase of the global r.m.s.d. value

calculated for all heavy atoms (Table 1).

Functional implications of the HDJ-1 J-domain structure
The structural features of the HDJ-1 J-domain are very similar to that of the previously reported backbone fold of the homologous domain from E. coli DnaJ (Szyperski et al., 1994; Hill et al., 1995) with slight differences in the helix termini. The

orientation of helix IV relative to the core of the HDJ-1 J-domain formed by helix I to helix III more closely resembles that of Hill et al. (residues 1 to 78) than that of Szyperski et al. (residues 2 to 108). The substantial number of long-range NOEs from helix IV (Figure 3(a)) to helices I, II and III resulted in the

unique orientation of helix IV relative to the core of the domain as shown by the ribbon drawing (Figure 7). Among these inter-helical NOEs, Arg60 makes ﬁve NOEs to Ile19 (helix II), three NOEs to Val53 (III) and eight NOEs to Leu54 (III); Phe63 makes two NOEs to Asp3 (I), seven NOEs to Tyr4 (I), ﬁve NOEs to Tyr5 (I), three NOEs to Val53 (III) and three NOEs to Leu54 (III) and Asp64 makes one NOE to Tyr5 (I).
The J-domains of E. coli DnaJ and HDJ-1 share approximately 50% sequence identity. A sequence alignment of 14 J-domains from numerous species is shown in Figure 8. It is of interest to note that many highly conserved residues are associated with the structural core of the J-domain. These include Ala14, Ile19, Ala27, Phe44, Ala50, Tyr51 and Leu54, which were well-deﬁned in the structure of the HDJ-1 J-domain (Table 1, Figure 6). Thr7, Ala22, Ile47 and Val53 are also involved in stabilizing the structural core of the HDJ-1 J-domain and although not absolutely conserved, appear to tolerate only conservative substitutions. Several charged residues are highly conserved or tolerate only conservative substitutions (positions 20, 21, 24, 43, 46, 56, 59 and 64) and are likely candidates for interactions with Hsp70. Other less well conserved residue positions (corresponding to Glu17 in helix II and Lys45 in helix III) have been implicated in playing a role in determining the speciﬁcity of the interaction of Hsp70 with DnaJ/HDJ-1 homologues (Schlenstedt et al., 1995). The HDJ-1 J-domain structure also provides some insight into the nature of a mutant of the yeast DnaJ homologue Sec63 which fails to interact with Kar2p, the endoplasmic reticulum Hsp70 homologue (Lyman & Schekman, 1995). This mutant, A181T, corresponds to the highly conserved Ala50

The polypeptide backbone and heavy atoms of the 15 best-deﬁned side-chains (residues 4, 7, 10, 14, 15, 19, 22, 27, 44, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53 and 54) and of the highly conserved tripeptide His31-Pro32-Asp33 are shown. The color codes are as in Figure 6 with the exception of the side-chains of the tripeptide which are shown in orange. Some sequence positions are identiﬁed with numbers.

in HDJ-1 which is located within the hydrophobic core of the domain and makes extensive long-range NOEs with Tyr4 and Thr7 on helix I. Substitution of this residue probably destabilizes both interactions between the N-terminal end of helix I and the C-terminal end of helix III as well as disrupting the antiparallel packing of helix II and helix III.
The most striking feature of the HDJ-1 J-domain structure is the location of the absolutely conserved tripeptide His31-Pro32-Asp33 on the surface of the loop connecting helix II and helix III. The r.m.s.d. value for the backbone atoms of this loop, composed of residues 29 to 39, is 0.72 A˚ , and it increases only slightly to 0.88 A˚ when the heavy atoms of the three side-chains of His31-Pro32Asp33 are included. This indicates that the loop is well-deﬁned locally. It is interesting to see that the side-chains of the conserved tripeptide His31Pro32-Asp33 are facing away from the core of the J-domain (Figures 6, 7). The orientation of these residues is due to observed NOEs between their side-chain protons and the protons of neighboring residues (e.g. His31 Hb-Leu28 Ha, His31 Hd-Leu28 Ha, Pro32 Hg-His31 Ha and Asp33 Hb-His31 He). Thus we propose that this tripeptide may be involved in mediating the interaction between HDJ-1 and Hsp70. Although HDJ-1 has not been the subject of mutational analysis, the position and orientation of the HPD tripeptide in the J-domain of HDJ-1 would explain several mutants which have been described in DnaJ and in the DnaJ

homologue Sec63. One such mutant, DnaJ259, is a point mutant that contains a H33Q substitution (corresponding to His31 of HDJ-1; Wall et al., 1994). This mutant cannot stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK, the Hsp70 homologue of E. coli, nor can it alter the conformation of DnaK in the presence of ATP. In Sec63, P157N and D158A substitutions (corresponding to Pro32 and Asp33 in HDJ-1) result in a translocation stalling defect (Feldheim et al., 1992). These mutations probably inhibit the interaction of Kar2p with Sec63, which is necessary for the completion of polypeptide translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum.
The sequences following the HPD tripeptide and forming the remainder of the loop are highly variable among the HDJ-1 homologues (Figure 8) with the exception of residues 34 and 35 which are well conserved. Whether such variation plays a role in determining the speciﬁcity of Hsp40/Hsp70 interactions or simply represents mutations in a functionally neutral sequence remains to be clariﬁed. The conserved proximity of the HPD tripeptide to the C-terminal end of helix II and the highly charged nature of this helix suggests the possibility that these two regions form a charged binding interface between HDJ-1 and Hsp70. Intriguingly, the mitochondrial protein MIM44, which interacts with mitochondrial Hsp70 in translocating polypeptide chains through the mitochondrial membranes, has a very short region of homology to the J-domain corresponding only to

Helices I to IV are shown in cyan, the loop and turns connecting the helices are shown in orange. The HPD tripeptide is indicated by the residues in red (His31), green (Pro32) and blue (Asp33).

helix II and the HPD motif (although the sequence in MIM44 is NED; Rassow et al., 1994). This suggests that the combination of helix II and the

HPD tripeptide may be the minimal sequence required for binding to Hsp70 proteins. Other regions of the J-domain may also be involved in interactions with Hsp70. Helix IV is less ordered compared to the other three helices in the J-domain. Asp64 in helix IV is highly conserved and may play a role in the J-domain/Hsp70 interaction. We noted that in 9 out of 20 conformers, a potential 310-helix may exist from residues 67 to 71 as O' -HN hydrogen bonds were observed between residues 67 to 70 and 68 to 71. Whether this potential 310-helix becomes an extension of helix IV in the HDJ-1/Hsp70 complex or simply represents a transient conformer remains to be clariﬁed.
Other interactions between chaperones may also be mediated by exposed loop structures. In the E. coli system, a small surface-exposed loop on the ATPase domain of DnaK has been proposed to be critical for the interaction of DnaK with its nucleotide exchange factor, GrpE (Buchberger et al., 1994). The sequence of this loop structure is relatively well conserved in eukaryotic homologues of DnaK but no direct homologue of GrpE has been identiﬁed in eukaryotes. Hip, an ATPase regulator and co-chaperone of mammalian Hsc70 does bind to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 (Ho¨ hfeld et al., 1995), but the role of the conserved loop, if any, in this interaction remains to be established.
J-domains have also been identiﬁed in several proteins other than molecular chaperones. These include auxilin, a cofactor in the Hsc70-dependent uncoating reaction of clathrin-coated vesicles (Ungewickell et al., 1995); the SV40 and polyoma virus T antigens which bind Hsp70 and are involved in viral replication (Kelly & Landry, 1994), and cysteine string proteins which function in synaptic vesicle transmission (Zinsmaier et al., 1994). Thus the J-domain may be a generalized module for concentrating Hsp70 at sites where its ability to bind and release polypeptide is utilized in a variety of cellular processes.

Materials and Methods
Cloning and over-expression of the HDJ-1 J-domain
The nucleotide sequence of the HDJ-1 J-domain (residues 1 to 76) was ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Saiki et al., 1988) using 1 ng of a full length HDJ-1 clone in the vector pQE9 as template DNA (Y. Minami, K. Ohtsuka, and F. U. Hartl, unpublished). The oligonucleotide primers 403 (5'-GAGTCACATATGGGTAAAGACTACTAC-3') and 404 (5'-GATTATGGATCCCTTTAGGCCTTCCTC-3') were used to prime the template DNA. The resulting 243 bp PCR product was puriﬁed on 1.5% (w/v) low melting point (LMP) agarose (NuSieve GTG, FMC), digested with the restriction endonucleases NdeI and BamHI (Boehringer), and ligated into the expression vector pET3a (Novagen). HDJ-1 J-domain clones in pET3a were transformed into E. coli TG1 cells and grown on 2 × YT agar containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was prepared from several of the resulting transformants using TIP-20 columns (Qiagen). Nucleotide sequencing of the resulting clones was performed using standard protocols (USB Chemicals) and conﬁrmed that the ampliﬁed sequence corresponded to the published HDJ-1 nucleotide sequence (Ohtsuka, 1993). A cysteine codon was introduced at the 3' end of the HDJ-1 J-domain as a result of the cloning process. One of the resulting clones, 40J-6 was transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 pLysE cells (Novagen). Individual transformants were grown overnight at 37°C in 2 × YT medium containing 150 mg/ml ampicillin and 50 mg/ml chloramphenicol, then diluted 1:100 and grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2. Expression of the HDJ-1 J-domain was induced by addition of IPTG to the cultures at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM followed by a further incubation at 37°C for four hours.
Puriﬁcation of unlabeled and uniformly 15N-labeled HDJ-1 J-domain
Cells expressing the HDJ-1 J-domain were subjected to centrifugation at 6000 g (Sorvall GS3 rotor). Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% sucrose, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 7.5 mg/ml DNase I) at a ﬁnal suspension of 1 g cells/ml buffer A. Cells were lysed by incubation at 4°C for one hour with mixing followed by sonication. The lysate was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 70,000 g at 4°C for one hour (Beckmann Ti45 rotor), the supernatant harvested, and subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation at 60% saturation. The precipitate was subjected to ultracentrifugation as above and the supernatant containing the soluble HDJ-1 J-domain collected and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 10.0, 10 mM DTT) at 4°C for 24 hours. The dialyzed supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) anion exchange column. The column was washed with ﬁve column volumes of buffer B and the ﬂow-through fractions containing the HDJ-1 J-domain were collected. These fractions were pooled and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC (Rainin HPXL) on a C4 column (Vydac, 1.0 cm × 25 cm) with an initial gradient of 2% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA/min from 5% to 95% acetonitrile. Fractions containing the HDJ-1 J-domain were collected, lyophilized, resuspended in buffer B and subjected to a second puriﬁcation step by RP-HPLC using a gradient of 1% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA/min from 0% to 60% acetonitrile. The resulting HDJ-1 J-domain was

lyophilized and resuspended in buffer B. The protein concentration was estimated by measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm (extinction coefﬁcient, 8914 M−1 cm−1). The HDJ-1 J-domain was concentrated to at least 1 mM in a volume of 0.6 ml by buffer exchange over a YM3 membrane (Amicon).
Uniformly 15N-labeled HDJ-1 J-domain was prepared by growth of BL21 DE3 pLysE 40J-6 cells overnight in 2 × YT as described above, followed by transfer into minimal labeling medium for induction. One liter labeling medium contained KH2PO4, 13 g; K2HPO4, 10 g; Na2HPO4, 9 g; K2SO4, 2.4 g; 14NH4Cl or 15NH4Cl, 1 g; ampicillin 150 mg/ml, chloramphenicol, 50 mg/ml, 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) thiamine-HCl and 5 ml trace element solution (100 ml stock solution: CaCl2·2H2O, 0.6 g; FeSO4·7H2O, 0.6 g; MnCl2·4H2O, 0.12 g, CoC12·6H2O, 80 mg; ZnSO4·7H2O, 70 mg; CuCl2·2H2O, 30 mg, H3BO3, 2 mg; (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 25 mg; EDTA, 0.5 g). Cells were ﬁrst ‘‘starved’’ for 1.5 hours in medium containing 14NH4Cl, harvested by centrifugation as above and transferred to 15NH4Cl-containing labeling medium. Following addition of IPTG each one liter culture was supplemented with 25 ml of 20% glucose at 1.5 hour intervals over a six hour time course of induction. Cells were harvested as above and puriﬁcation of the 15N-labeled HDJ-1 J-domain was performed as above.
NMR measurements
NMR measurements were performed on Varian Unity Plus 600 spectrometers equipped with a self-shielded z-gradient probe. Two NMR samples, a uniformly 15N-labeled and an unlabeled HDJ-1 J-domain, were prepared in the same solution conditions: 01.6 mM protein, 25 mM sodium phosphate, 8 mM perdeuterated dithiothreitol, 90% H2O/10% 2H2O at pH 5.8 and 30°C. The following 2D homonuclear experiments were recorded in both H2O and 2H2O solution: 2QF-CO-SY, clean-TOCSY (Griesinger et al., 1988) with a mixing time of 80 ms, and NOESY (Anil-Kumar et al., 1980) with a mixing time of 80 ms. In addition, an E. COSY spectrum (Griesinger et al., 1985) was recorded in 2H2O. Typical data sizes were 400 × 1024 complex points in t1 and t2, respectively. Two heteronuclear spectra were recorded with the uniformly 15N-labeled sample: a 3D 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY (Fesik & Zuiderweg, 1988) with a mixing time of 80 ms, data size of 170 × 40 × 512 complex points and a total recording time of 85 hours, and a gradient-enhanced 2D [15N, 1H] HSQC spectrum (Kay et al., 1992) with a data size of 128 × 2048 complex data points. For both the homonuclear and heteronuclear experiments, the States-TPPI method (Marion et al., 1989) was used for obtaining the phase-sensitive mode in the indirectly detected dimension. For the experiments in H2O, the water signal was suppressed by selective saturation (Wider et al., 1983). Data were processed with the VNMR software, version 5.1 (Varian Associates). Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data were multiplied with a shifted Gaussian bell ﬁlter in the directly detected dimension and with a shifted sine bell ﬁlter in the indirectly detected dimensions. Baseline distortions were corrected using the program FLATT (Gu¨ ntert & Wu¨ thrich, 1992).
Slowly exchanging amide protons were identiﬁed in a homonuclear TOCSY spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 80 ms, where the lyophilized protein was dissolved in 2H2O immediately before starting the NMR measurement. The program XEASY (Bartels et al., 1995)

was used for peak picking, and for the integration of the cross peaks in the homonuclear and heteronuclear NOESY spectra. Vicinal scalar coupling constants 3JHNa were extracted by inverse Fourier transformation of in-phase multiplets (Szyperski et al., 1992) from the gradient-enhanced 2D [15N, 1H] HSQC spectrum. 3Jab scalar coupling constants were measured in the E. COSY spectrum that was zero-ﬁlled to 4096 data points in t2 prior to Fourier transformation.
Determination of the three-dimensional structure
The structure calculations were performed with the program DIANA (Gu¨ ntert et al., 1991a). One REDAC cycle (Gu¨ ntert & Wu¨ thrich, 1991) was used for improved convergence. Upper distance constraints were obtained from cross-peak volumes measured in the aforementioned three NOESY spectra (2D homonuclear NOESY spectra in H2O and 2H2O, and the 3D 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY) using the program CALIBA (Gu¨ ntert et al., 1991a). No hydrogen bond constraints were used during the structure calculations. Dihedral angle constraints and stereospeciﬁc assignments for b-methylene groups were determined from the spin-spin coupling constraints and assignments for b-methylene groups were determined from the spin-spin coupling constraints and the intraresidual and sequential NOEs using the program HABAS (Gu¨ ntert et al., 1989). Further stereospeciﬁc assignments of bCH2 and of other pairs of diastereotopic substituents were obtained with the program GLOMSA (Gu¨ ntert et al., 1991a,b). Restrained energy-minimization was performed in a water shell for 1500 conjugate gradient steps using the program OPAL (P. Luginbu¨ hl, P. Gu¨ ntert, M. Billeter & K. Wu¨ thrich, unpublished), which employs the AMBER 94 force ﬁeld (Weiner et al., 1986) and further includes pseudo-energy terms for distance constraints and dihedral angle constraints (Billeter et al., 1989). The pseudo-energy was proportional to the the power of the distance constraint violations, and it was adjusted such that violations of 0.1 A˚ for distance constraints and 2.5° for dihedral angle constraints corresponded to kBT/2 at room temperature. There was no cutoff used for non-bonded interactions during restrained energy minimization. The structural analysis was performed with the program XAM (Xia 1992).
