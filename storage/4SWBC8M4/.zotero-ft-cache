Mechanics of Hsp70 chaperones enables differential interaction with client proteins
Rainer Schlecht1,3, Annette H Erbse1–3, Bernd Bukau1 & Matthias P Mayer1

Hsp70 chaperones interact with a wide spectrum of substrates ranging from unfolded to natively folded and aggregated proteins. Structural evidence suggests that bound substrates are entirely enclosed in a b-sheet cavity covered by a helical lid, which requires structural rearrangements including lid opening to allow substrate access. We analyzed the mechanics of the lid movement of bacterial DnaK by disulfide fixation of lid elements to the b-sheet and by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy using spin labels in the lid and b-sheet. Our results indicate that the lid-forming helix B adopts at least three conformational states and, notably, does not close over bound proteins, implying that DnaK does not only bind to extended peptide stretches of protein substrates but can also accommodate regions with substantial tertiary structure. This flexible binding mechanism provides a basis for the broad spectrum of substrate conformers of Hsp70s.

Hsp70 chaperones play a dominant role in the cellular system that controls conformational states of proteins. A major feature attribut­ ing to this role is the ability of Hsp70s to function in regulated inter­ actions with a large spectrum of protein clients that have conformers ranging from extended nascent polypeptides to fully assembled pro­ tein oligomers and aggregates1,2. This broad spectrum of client con­ formers is, however, difficult to reconcile with the mode of substrate interaction that is considered to be fairly simple and invariant.
Client binding occurs through the transient association of short hydrophobic segments with the C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD)1–5. This interaction is allosterically regulated by the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), whereby the conformation of the SBD changes between at least two states in a nucleotide-dependent manner6. Substrate trapping in a complex with Hsp70 requires ATP hydrolysis in a process that is synergistically stimulated by substrate binding and the activity of J-domain–containing cochaperones, which have a dual function to target substrates to Hsp70 and to stimulate ATP hydrolysis7–9.
The crystal structure of the SBD of the Escherichia coli Hsp70 homolog DnaK (residues 389–607) in complex with a heptamer substrate peptide10 revealed a unique assembly of two subdomains (Fig. 1). The first is a two-layer twisted β sandwich (residues 389– 507) with four upward protruding loops that enclose the substrate peptide. The second is an α-helical subdomain (residues 508–607), which packs (through helix A and the proximal part of helix B) against the inner loops (L1,2 and L4,5) of the β-sheet subdomain and forms a lid-like structure over the substrate-binding cleft. The cocrystal­ lized peptide is tightly encased by the substrate-binding pocket in an extended conformation. The helical lid seals in the substrate by forming a latch of a salt bridge and two hydrogen bonds to the outer

loops (L3,4 and L5,6) (Fig. 1a). Subsequent NMR and crystal structures of SBDs from different Hsp70s showed essentially the same confor­ mation emphasizing evolutionary conservation of the structure11–16. These structures, however, did not clarify whether in the absence of a peptide substrate the lid is tightly closed and how it opens to bind a substrate molecule. Most notable is the tight enclosure of the substrate peptide (Fig. 1b). Because of the size of the lid and the β-sheet sub­ domain, a folded protein would have to undergo extensive unfolding to accommodate a similar binding geometry in the Hsp70 substratebinding cavity as the cocrystallized peptide10. Such a complete local unfolding of the DnaK-interacting substrates resulting in a minimal distance to the remainder of the protein of ≥10 Å is difficult to rec­ oncile with the fact that the preferred binding sites for Hsp70s are stretches of hydrophobic residues, which are entropically disfavored in an aqueous environment.
To address these open questions, we introduced cysteine residues into the E. coli DnaK SBD such that possible opening movements were restricted. In addition, we used site-directed spin labeling combined with EPR spectroscopy, which enabled us to observe dynamic changes in the distance between the β subdomain and the helical lid when peptide or protein substrates were bound to the chaperone.
RESULTS
Probing the mechanics of SBD movements by disulfide bonds
Four models have been proposed for the ATP-induced opening of the substrate binding pocket of Hsp70 proteins: (i) unfolding of the middle part of helix B and kinking of its distal part, retaining close contacts between the β-sheet subdomain and helix A and the proximal part of helix B10 (Fig. 1c, left); (ii) complete detachment of helix B and upward rotation6 (Fig. 1c, middle left); (iii) sideward movement

To test these hypotheses, we introduced two pairs of cysteines into the substrate-binding domain of E. coli DnaK such that disulfide bond formation restricted the mobility of helix A or B (Fig. 1a). In a first variant, helix A can be linked to the β subdomain (E444C A519C; DnaK-HA), which should prevent any rotation around helix A and which prevents a complete detachment of the helical subdomain, as in the Hsp110 structure. In a second variant, the proximal part of helix B can be linked to the β subdomain (K446C D526C; DnaK-HB), which additionally prevents the upward rotation of the helical lid around a hinge between helices A and B (Fig. 1c, middle left). We then purified and oxidized the resulting mutant proteins. We confirmed quantitative disulfide bond formation by mass spectrometric analysis after modification of free cysteine side chains with sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) (Supplementary Fig. 1). DnaK-HA, once oxidized, could not be reduced by any reducing conditions tested. Therefore, we purified it in the presence of 20 mM DTT, and we performed all experiments in the presence of this high concentration of reducing agents to ensure the preservation of the reduced state. To verify structural integrity, we subjected oxidized and reduced proteins to thermal denaturation. We detected no structural defects by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Supplementary Table 1) and Fourier transform infrared spectro­ scopy (Supplementary Fig. 2), and the mutant variants were as stable as wild-type DnaK.
Lid fixation does not inhibit substrate binding
To evaluate whether the restriction of conformational flexibility of the helical subdomain influences interaction with substrates, we first ana­ lyzed binding of a fluorescent peptide to oxidized and reduced DnaK double-cysteine mutants. In the absence of ATP, peptide substrate bound to both oxidized DnaK variants, DnaK-HA and DnaK-HB, as evidenced by fluorescence increase (data not shown). Peptide ­dissociation kinetics for both oxidized DnaK variants were similar to those for wild-type DnaK, demonstrating that the disulfide bridges do not prevent the opening of the substrate-binding pocket in the high-affinity state (Fig. 2 and Table 1). In the reduced state, however,

dissociation occurred more rapidly, with a 2- and 30-fold increased rate for DnaK-HA and DnaK-HB, respectively. The dramatic effect observed for DnaK-HB is most likely caused by the disruption of a network of ionic interactions stabilizing the interface between helices A and B and the β subdomain by the introduction of cysteine resi­ dues18 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Upon disulfide bond formation, the interaction of the lid with the β subdomain may be stabilized, similar to the ionic interactions in the wild-type protein.
In the absence of ATP, peptide substrates associate to wild-type DnaK in a biphasic process because of a conformational equilibrium of the SBD of DnaK19–21. Reduced and oxidized DnaK-HA bound a peptide substrate with very similar kinetics as the wild-type protein (Table 1). In contrast, for reduced DnaK-HB, we observed a higher peptide association rate. Notably, for oxidized DnaK-HB, peptide association rates were similar to the wild-type protein; however, more peptide associated with the faster rate, arguing for an influ­ ence of the mutations on the conformation of the β subdomain of the DnaK SBD.
In vivo, the main substrates for DnaK are not peptides but rather partially folded and misfolded proteins. DnaK even binds some pro­ teins in their native state, as, for example, the E. coli heat shock tran­ scription factor σ32, which was shown to be regulated by DnaK22–24 and serves as a chaperone substrate in vitro25–29. Therefore, we ana­ lyzed the kinetic parameters of the interaction of wild-type DnaK and double-cysteine variants with radiolabeled 3H-σ32 under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. We determined dissociation equi­ librium and rate constants by gel filtration experiments, and these results are summarized in Table 1. Notably, the affinity for σ32 was very similar for all DnaK variants tested under both oxidizing and reducing conditions (Fig. 2 and Table 1). To show that the DnaK variants bound substrates specifically in the substrate-binding pocket, we combined the double-cysteine replacements with an amino acid exchange in the substrate-binding pocket demonstrated previously to block substrate binding (DnaK-V436F30; Supplementary Fig. 4). The V436F alteration reduced substrate binding to wild-type DnaK and double-cysteine variants alike, confirming that the interaction observed is a bona fide chaperone-substrate interaction. The deter­ mined dissociation rates and calculated association rates, however, were lower for both oxidized DnaK variants as compared to wild-type

(Fig. 4a). Only synergistic stimulation was 2.5-fold lower than for wild-type DnaK, which could be due to a defect in the locking in of substrates into the binding pocket. Although reduced DnaK-HA behaves like wild-type protein, the disulfide-linked form shows a com­ pletely different behavior. The basal ATP hydrolysis rate is increased about ten times compared to wild-type DnaK but does not change at all upon addition of substrate and/or DnaJ.
To investigate the communication between the NBD and SBD fur­ ther, we determined peptide dissociation rates in the presence of ATP (Fig. 4b). In wild-type DnaK, ATP binding leads to an opening of the substrate binding site, which increases the dissociation rate for the pep­ tide substrate by three orders of magnitude20,30. Although both reduced double-cysteine mutants showed a slightly higher ATP-­stimulated release rate, and oxidized DnaK-HB behaved like the wild-type protein, peptide dissociation from oxidized DnaK-HA was as just as slow as in the absence of ATP (compare to Fig. 2). In addition, we analyzed the coupling status of NBD and SBD by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the single tryptophan residue located in the NBD of DnaK, which undergoes an ATP-induced blueshift when the SBD is allosteri­ cally coupled31,32. In the reduced state, both DnaK variants showed a blueshift of 3–4 nm, similar to the value obtained for wild-type protein, arguing for functional interdomain coupling (Fig. 4c). However, when the proximal part of helix B was fixed to the β subdomain by oxidation, the maximum of tryptophan ­fluorescence shifted by only about 1 nm.

This finding is consistent with the observation that the proximal part of helix B is required for the nucleotide-induced changes in fluorescence32. When helix A is fixed to the β subdomain, helix B should be free to interact with the NBD and induce a blueshift. However, we observed no changes in tryptophan fluorescence. Taken together, these findings show that mobility of the helical lid is a prerequisite for functional allo­ steric control of the Hsp70 cycle. In particular, a relocation of helix A relative to the β subdomain appears to be crucial.
The helical lid does not close over protein substrates
Although the above experiments show that the proximal part of the helical lid can stay fixed with the β subdomain even when substrates are binding to DnaK, they do not provide information on the status of the distal part of the helical lid. We therefore investigated whether the helical lid closes completely even when folded protein substrates are bound, as suggested by the crystal structure of the DnaK-SBD– ­peptide complex10. For steric reasons, it is not possible to approach this issue by disulfide bridge formation. To investigate possible transi­ tions between an open and a closed state of the distal part of helix B, we instead used EPR spectroscopy, which allowed us to monitor changes in the distance of paramagnetic centers induced by lid move­ ment33. To this end, we introduced cysteine residues into the distal part of helix B and/or the outer loop L3,4 of the β subdomain of DnaK, and we spin labeled these residues (DnaK-E430R1,R547R1′; Fig. 1a). First, we tested the effect of ATP binding on the spectrum of sin­ gle- and double-labeled DnaK. EPR spectra in the absence (Fig. 5a, left) and presence (Fig. 5a, right) of ATP showed a clear difference when overlaid with the algebraic sum of the spectra of the corre­ sponding single mutants (Supplementary Fig. 6a) normalized to the same number of spins. This sum represents the spectrum expected if the two labels were not interacting. For both spectra, we computed distance distributions33 (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 6b). The distance distribution in the absence of nucleotide shows two interact­ ing spin populations, one with an approximately 12 Å distance and one with a broader population between 16 Å and 20 Å. Only a small fraction of the label was not interacting (fraction of non-interacting spins, fNI = 0.09), which is at a distance of more than 20 Å. Upon ATP addition, the short-distance population disappeared and almost 80% of the spin labels were separated by more than 20 Å, whereas in 20% of the molecules, the distance was in a range similar to the open form of the ADP-bound state.

To determine the effect of substrate binding on the spin-spin dis­ tance distribution, we first measured spectra of the labeled DnaK variant in the presence of the high-affinity peptide σ32-M195–N207, which comprises the binding site of DnaK in native σ32 (ref. 29) (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The spectra for peptide-bound and free DnaK-E430R1,R547R1′ in the absence of ATP overlay perfectly, indicating no changes in the distance distribution between the β sandwich and helical lid upon interaction with peptide substrates. The peptide had no effect on the spin-labeled single-cysteine vari­ ants (Supplementary Fig. 7b). To ensure that the spin-labels do not prevent substrate binding, we determined binding affinities of the fluorescently labeled peptide to DnaK with and without spin labels and found a difference of less than two-fold (Supplementary Fig. 7c).
As the cocrystallized peptide is tightly enclosed by the SBD (Fig. 1b), this raises the question of whether the SBD of DnaK binds native protein substrates in the same mode or, alternatively, whether the SBD has to assume a more open conformation in order to accom­ modate folded protein substrates. For these experiments, we used two in vivo substrates, σ32 and the monomeric version of the F-plasmid replication initiator protein, RepE54 (ref. 34).
In contrast to the spectra for the peptide-bound DnaK, the spec­ tra of the double spin-labeled DnaK in complex with σ32 or RepE54 showed only little evidence of spin-spin interactions (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 8b, left panels) and had nearly identical line shapes compared to the spectrum of the ATP-bound ‘open lid’ con­ formation of the double mutant (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 8b, right panels), meaning that about 20% of the molecules were in a partially open state, and the remaining molecules showed a dis­ tance between spin labels of more than 20 Å. We took great care to exclude any contaminations with ATP in these experiments, and we checked all components for nucleotide content by HPLC. Although a protein substrate could affect the orientation of the spin labels in our EPR experiments, we could not detect changes in the spectra of the labeled single mutants upon substrate protein binding, indi­ cating that the mobility of the spin probes was not altered by the

The left panel shows the comparison of the experimental spectrum of the double mutant (blue line) with the algebraic sum of the spectra of the corresponding single mutants (gray line) in the presence of bound protein, normalized to the same number of spins. The right panel shows an overlay of the experimental EPR spectrum of the double mutant in the presence of ATP (red line) with the spectrum of the mutant in the presence of σ32 (blue line), illustrating that the spectrum of proteinsubstrate–bound DnaK is similar to the ATP bound, ‘open lid’ conformation.

presence of the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 8a,c). These results clearly indicate that binding of natively folded substrates forces the SBD of full-length DnaK to adopt an open conformation rather than to fully close and encase an extended stretch in the structure of the substrates. Although the distal part of helix B remains open when a protein substrate is bound, the disulfide bridge between the proximal part of helix B and the β subdomain can be closed even after protein binding (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Because the lid remains open when a protein substrate is bound, we wondered whether the lid adopts a position far removed from the bound substrate or whether the lid could interact with the substrate possibly as part of the chaperone function. Therefore, we attached a cross-linker to the distal part of helix B. Figure 6 shows that a bound protein substrate can be cross-linked to helix B, indicating that the lid can approach the bound protein substrate to at least 10 Å.
DISCUSSION This study reveals new insights into the complex conformational dynamics of Hsp70 chaperones that control their interactions with substrates. The allosteric regulation by the nucleotide status of Hsp70 leads to an ATP-induced docking of the NBD and SBD and

Figure 6  The distal part of helix B can be cross-linked to bound substrate. We labeled DnaK-Q424C and DnaK-R547C with the heterobifunctional, thiol-specific, UV-inducible cross-linker 4-(2-Iodoacetamido)benzophenone (BPIA) and cross-linked to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and σ32 by irradiation with UV light39. We visualized His-tagged substrates and crosslinking products by immunoblotting with a Penta-His Antibody (QIAGEN). Bands corresponding to DnaK-substrate complexes can be detected when BPIA is linked either to the β-sheet subdomain close to the substrate binding pocket (Q424C, compare to ref. 39) or to the distal part of helix B (R547C), however this is true only for the native substrate protein σ32 and not for YFP, which is not bound by DnaK in its native state.

(a) The ‘closed lid’ crystal structure is depicted

as a dark gray cartoon and the R1 side chains as

a dark gray stick model. The green translucent

helical lid illustrates a distance of the nitroxide

groups of the R1 moieties of 18 Å with a kinking

of helix B opposite the substrate-binding

pocket. The blue translucent lid visualizes a

possible wide-open structure with a distance

of 38 Å between the R1 groups. Because a

distance of 38 Å is far beyond the detection

range of dipolar spin-spin interactions with the

method used, it remains unclear whether the

lid actually opens to this extent. (b) Multiple

to allow lid closure, whereas others are rather

unlikely to do so.

the burial of the hydrophobic linker connecting these domains35,36. These conformational changes trigger an opening of the β subdomain and a relocation of the helical lid of the SBD, processes which have remained poorly understood despite their decisive importance for Hsp70 function in protein folding. In the present study, we show that (i) no movement of the proximal part of helix B away from the inner loop L4,5 is required to allow binding of protein substrates. The C-terminal helix bundle becomes mobile presumably after the melting of helix B opposite the substrate binding cavity, as suggested by amide hydrogen exchange data36. (ii) Allosteric regulation of the nucleotidecontrolled chaperone activity requires a movement of helix A and the proximal part of helix B relative to the β subdomain. (iii) Interaction with folded protein substrates does not strictly require a closure of the helical lid. The paradigm that Hsp70-bound protein substrates interact with the chaperone through extended peptide stretches that are at least 10 Å separated from the folded portion of the substrate therefore has to be revised6,10,37.
The SBD of Hsp70 chaperones must undergo large conformational rearrangements to allow substrate entry to the binding cavity. To dif­ ferentiate between alternative possible movements, we introduced cysteine residues into DnaK based on the crystal structure of the DnaK SBD10 with the aim of restricting the mobility of the helical lid relative to the β subdomain upon disulfide bond formation. Notably, binding of peptide as well as folded protein substrates is not affected by linking helix A or the proximal part of helix B to the β-sheet sub­ domain (Fig. 2). This finding strongly suggests that a melting of helix B opposite the substrate binding cavity as suggested in a previous study10 (Fig. 1c left panel) can occur and is sufficient to allow entry of substrate molecules into the binding pocket.
Although the DnaK variants, which show a reduced mobility of the helical lid, bind to substrates similar to wild-type protein, they do not promote refolding of chemically denatured luciferase and they exhibit reduced chaperone activity toward heat-denatured MDH under oxi­ dizing conditions (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5). This indicates that a different property of the protein is impaired, most likely allo­ steric control of the chaperone cycle by a nucleotide. Indeed, our data indicate that the transitions between the ATP- and ADP-bound states require a relocation of helix A relative to the β subdomain. DnaK-HA is clearly impaired in allosteric regulation in the oxidized state, as the protein is not responsive to stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by substrate and vice versa of peptide release by ATP (Fig. 4).
Our data indicate that there is an equilibrium between a ‘lid closed’ state, which is described by crystal structure determination10 (gray structure in Fig. 7a); a ‘lid open’ state (lid between translucent green

and translucent blue in Fig. 7a), where the spin labels do not inter­ act in EPR; and an ‘intermediate-open’ conformation (translucent green in Fig. 7a), which is adopted upon binding to bulky substrates. According to our data, all three states are populated in the ADPbound form, with the closed state being the prominent species. Upon ATP binding to the NBD, we detected only the open and intermedi­ ate-open conformations.
Hsp70s have several types of substrates (Fig. 7b): nascent chains at the ribosome and translocating polypeptides present themselves as largely unfolded substrates and, similar to peptide substrates, Hsp70s may completely encase them with the lid closed. However, Hsp70s also bind to native, stress denatured and aggregated proteins, which expose hydrophobic residues at the surface but which are unlikely in a completely extended conformation. In these cases, it is hard to imagine how the lid could thread between strands of an aggregate to enclose a single strand. Notably, amyloids contain β-sheet cores, and up to now it was inconceivable that Hsp70s could bind to these core structures, which would not allow a close encasement of a single strand. Our data give new insight into the interaction of Hsp70s with such structures and, consequently, the ambiguous role of Hsp70s in amyloid formation and prion propagation38. These findings imply that the range of Hsp70 target segments within protein substrates may be larger than anticipated from the crystal structure of the SBD of DnaK, which further broadens the functional versatility of Hsp70 chaperones in protein folding.
If the lid does not close on protein substrates, the question arises of why Hsp70s have this structural element. One possible expla­ nation is that the lid contacts the substrate, as suggested by our cross-­linking experiments (Fig. 6), and that this contact between the lid and substrate causes conformational changes in the substrate which are important for the chaperone action of Hsp70s. Indeed, the lidless DnaK variant DnaK163 was unable to refold chemically denatured firefly luciferase, suggesting that the lid may play an important role in the refolding of some substrates30. The lid may also directly interact with protein substrates to modulate the affinity for the substrate. Finally, the lid may also serve as a docking site for cochaperones. Eukaryotic Hsp70s have a number of TPR-domain– containing cochaperones such as Hop, Chip and TPR2 that bind to the C-­terminal EEVD motif. Here the lid could have evolved into an interaction platform.

ONLINE METHODS Plasmids. The dnaK gene was PCR amplified from plasmid pUHE-2fd∆12(dnaK+)40 (primers: 5′-CCAGTGGGTCTCAGGTGGTATGGGTAAAATAATTGGTAT CG-3′; 5′-GGCCATCTCGAGTTATTTTTTGTCTTTGAC-3′ ), digested with BsaI and XhoI, and ligated into pCA528 (ref. 41), resulting in pCA528-dnaK. Doublecysteine mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis42.
Proteins. Wild-type and mutant DnaK were purified according to an established protocol40 or fused to a N-terminal His6-SUMO tag expressed from pCA528dnaK in cells from the BL21 strain (Invitrogen) at 30 °C. The protein was purified using Ni-IDA matrix (Protino, Macherey-Nagel) and then washing with buffer A (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl and 5 mM EDTA) and buffer A containing 5 mM ATP. Protein was eluted with 250 mM imidazole and dialyzed against buffer A after supplementation with His6-Ulp1. Disulfide bond formation was induced by diluting oxidizing solution (5 mM CuSO4 and 17.5 mM 1,10phenanthroline) ten times into a low concentration (<10 µM) protein solution and 10 min incubation at 30 °C. The catalyst was removed during nucleotide removal43, and DnaK was further purified as described40. The nucleotide content (<3–5%) in the final protein preparation was assessed by analytical ion exchange chromatography41. His6-σ32 was purified as described previously44, and His6RepE54 (RepE-R117P) was a kind gift of F. Rodriguez (Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie der Universität Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany).
Kinetic measurements. Kinetic measurements were performed at 30 °C in HKM buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl2). ATPase activities were determined under single-turnover conditions as described45.
The dissociation rates for peptides were determined according to the proce­ dure used in a previous study30 with the modification of using dansyl-labeled NRLLLTG (DNR) peptide and unlabeled NRLLLTG (NR) peptide (Peptide Specialty Laboratories GmbH). Peptide association was determined by rapidly mixing 2 µM DNR peptide with 0.5 µM DnaK.
Fluorescence spectra. Measurements of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were performed as described previously30.
Determination of dissociation constants. Dissociation equilibrium constants for DnaK variants were determined as published45. The Kd values were calculated by ­fitting a quadratic equation to the data using GraFit version 5.0 (Erithacus Software).
To determine the dissociation rate constants, 0.5 µM 3H-σ32 and 5 µM DnaK were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h in a total volume of 20 µl. After addition of 1 mM NR peptide, the amount of complex remaining at different time points was determined by gel filtration. Rate constants were calculated by fitting a single exponential decay function to the data using GraFit version 5.0.
Chaperone activity assays. Refolding of chemically denatured luciferase was performed as published46. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH, 0.1 µM) was denatured at 47 °C for 30 min in MDH buffer (200 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl and 40 mM magnesium acetate) in the presence of 0.1 µM DnaJ. Protein refolding was started by mixing MDH 1:1 with a chaperone solution (10 µM DnaK and 2 µM GrpE) at 30 °C. Enzymatic activity was measured by diluting aliquots 20 times into assay buffer (150 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.6, 0.5 mM oxaloacetate, 0.3 mM NADH and 1 mM DTT) and following the absorption of NADH in a microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech) at 340 nm for 5 min.
Modification of cysteine residues and mass spectrometry. The protein was incubated with a ten-fold excess of sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosu lfonate (MTSES) over the total amount of thiols in the reaction. To probe the success of oxidation reactions, samples were treated in the presence of at least 5 M guanidine hydrochloride to ensure accessibility. Derivatized proteins were subjected to ESI-MS analysis on a QSTAR Pulsar (Applied Biosystems) mass spec­ trometer as described36. To separate σ32 from DnaK, proteins were eluted from the trap column by a gradient from 40–75% buffer B within 35 min.
Site-directed spin labeling. DnaK single- and double-cysteine mutants were passed through a Spehadex G50 column equilibrated with buffer TKM (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl and 5 mM MgCl2) to remove the reducing agent and were immediately incubated with a ten-fold excess (over cysteine)

of 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-∆3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL) to form a new side chain designated R1 (Fig. 1a). The free label was removed by gel filtration.
EPR measurements. All spectra were recorded with a Bruker ELEXSYS 500 cw X-Band spectrometer fitted with the Bruker ultra-high-sensitivity resonator (SuperHigh-Q Cavity: ER 4122SHQE, Bruker). The spectra were recorded as 200 Gauss (G) scans in solution at room temperature (22 °C) with an incident microwave power of 2 mW and modulation amplitude of 1.2 G at 100 kHz with DnaK concentra­ tions of 50–100 µM. Spectra in the presence of ATP were recorded after addition of 2 mM ATP to the sample used to measure the spectra of nucleotide-free DnaK.
Peptide-DnaK complexes were pre-formed by incubating 50 µM spin-labeled DnaK with 300 µM peptide (σ32-M195–Q207; MAPVLYLQDKSSN) at 30 °C for 1 h. To form His6-σ32 or His6-RepE54-DnaK complexes, spin-labeled DnaK was diluted to 2 µM DnaK in buffer TKM and incubated with 10 µM substrate protein for 2 h at 30 °C. Unbound DnaK was removed by Ni2+-NTA chromatography.
Determination of interspin distances. Interspin distance distributions were derived from spectra exhibiting broadening by spin-spin interactions of close spin label as described33 using a software kindly provided by C. Altenbach using LabVIEW (National Instruments).
Modeling of the R1 side chain in the structure of the DnaK SBD. The R1 side chains were modeled into the DnaK SBD essentially as described in reference 47. The starting conformation for the R1 chains was X1 = 310° and X2 = 310° (g+g+ conformation)48–50. X3 was also assigned g+ conformation (270°). The structure was energy minimized with all backbone Cβ and disulfide atoms fixed in space, allowing only rotations of the X4 and X5 dihedrals.
Dissociation equilibrium titration. We incubated 0.1 µM σ32-Q132–Q144-C-AANS (ref. 51) with 0.05 to 5 µM wild-type DnaK and DnaK-E430R1, R547R1′ at 30 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence emission spectra (350–500 nm) were measured in a PerkinElmer LS55 Luminescence Spectrometer with a 335 nm excitation wavelength.
Cross-linking. DnaK-Q424C and DnaK-R547C were labeled with 4-(2-Iodoace tamido)benzophenone (BPIA), and cross-linking was performed as described39. Cross-linking mixtures contained 2 µM DnaK, 10 µM substrate (His6-σ32 or His6-YFP) and 2 µM ATP.
