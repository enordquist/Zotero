Abstract Cells respond to protein-damaging (proteotoxic) stress by activation of the Heat Shock Response (HSR). The HSR provides cells with an enhanced ability to endure proteotoxic insults and plays a crucial role in determining subsequent cell death or survival. The HSR is, therefore, a critical factor that influences the toxicity of protein stress. While named for its vital role in the cellular response to heat stress, various components of the HSR system and the molecular chaperone network execute essential physiological functions as well as responses to other diverse toxic insults. The effector molecules of the HSR, the Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) and Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs), are also important regulatory targets in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. Modulation of the HSR and/or its extended network have, therefore, become attractive treatment strategies for these diseases. Development of effective therapies will, however, require a detailed understanding of the HSR, important features of which continue to be uncovered and are yet to be completely understood. We review recently described and hallmark mechanistic principles of the HSR, the regulation and functions of HSPs, and contexts in which the HSR is activated and influences cell fate in response to various toxic conditions.

Introduction
The heat shock response (HSR) is mounted by cells of all kingdoms to counter damage to their proteome, or proteotoxic stress (Lindquist and Craig 1988; Richter et al. 2010). The response is observed most pronouncedly after exposure

to heat shock or exposure to proteotoxic compounds such as arsenite and heavy metals. The damage caused by proteotoxic stress can be acute and the response involves the almost immediate synthesis of HSPs that can ameliorate the toxicity (Richter et al. 2010; Bunch and Calderwood 2015). Proteins of the HSP nomenclature are dominantly enriched amongst the cohort of genes induced by heat stress in various organisms, although dramatic-fold induction by heat stress is not a property shared by all genes of the HSP gene-protein families (Finka et al. 2011). HSPs are molecular chaperones with essential roles in protein folding that were shown to underlie their homeostatic properties in the HSR (Lindquist and Craig 1988; Hartl 1996). The term ‘molecular chaperone’ was coined to describe proteins that prevent improper intraand inter- molecular interactions (Laskey et al. 1978; Ellis and Vies 1991) and are typically no longer present when the client substrate is performing its native function (Ellis and Vies 1991; Balchin et al. 2016). Molecular chaperones are key effectors in the proteostasis network (Balch et al. 2008a) and serve diverse regulatory functions upon cellular proteins. HSPs and other chaperones are essential for the

folding of almost all intracellular proteins, and they also facilitate protein transport into organelles, mediate nonnative protein degradation and aggregate disaggregation, regulate protein metabolic activities, and modulate protein complex assembly and disassembly (Fig. 1) (Lindquist and Craig 1988; Ellis 2007; Rudiger et al. 1997a; Moran Luengo et al. 2019; Hendrick and Hartl 1993). Chaperoning in the cytosol is a complex process and requires multiple proteins belonging to the small HSPs (sHsps), Hsp60(CCT), Hsp70, and Hsp90 HSP families (Rudiger et al. 1997a; Fan et al. 2020; Arrigo and Gibert 2014; Frydman et al. 1992; Schopf et al. 2017), as well as a series of essential co-factors known as co-chaperones (King et al. 2001; Calderwood 2013). The HSP families are designated by their molecular weight and shared domains, with the large Hsp110 protein being grouped as a subgroup of the Hsp70 family (Kampinga et al. 2009). There are several notable features of HSPs including the existence of ‘stress-inducible’ and ‘constitutive’ paralogous species within the same HSP families, analogous HSPs localized to distinct cellular compartments, and distinctive tissue specific expression. There is evidence for significant gene-duplication events and accumulation of pseudogenes that have occurred in many species, as well as a remarkable conservation of many HSP sequences and functions across evolution; yet divergence and specialized functions also exist between species for respective orthologues (Eguchi et al. 2018a; Brocchieri et al. 2008; McCallister et al. 2015). While the sum of proteostatic functions carried out by HSPs is acutely important for cells to survive proteotoxic stress, the constitutively expressed members from each HSP family are required to fulfill these roles under non stress

conditions. The capacity to which HSPs are able to counter proteotoxic stress is a function of the levels to which they are expressed in the cell. Unlike enzymes that act to covalently modify their substrates and promote metabolic reactions within cells, the HSPs act in a one-on-one manner with “client” proteins and in fact many individual HSP molecules may bind to single unfolded polypeptide, while the HSPsubstrate interactions may also be of an extended duration (Hartl 1996). Considering this property, with the potentially vast number of different HSP substrates exposed after a proteotoxic stress, large quantities of HSPs are needed to maintain protein folding within the cell; indeed, approximately 10% of the proteome mass is comprised of the HSPs (Finka and Goloubinoff 2013). While the abundance of individual HSP genes and proteins can vary substantially between different cell lines under standard culture conditions, the ‘core’ molecules of the HSP network, Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp60/ TRiC chaperone systems appear to more generally dominate the relative mass distribution of the chaperome, for example they were together found to constitute 8.8% of protein content in cultured HeLa cells (Finka and Goloubinoff 2013; Tang et al. 2005; Finka et al. 2015).

conserved and an extremely elegant manner (Richter et al. 2010; Subjeck et al. 1982a). This state is primarily achieved in mammalian cells by employing the sequence-specific transcription factor, Heat Shock Transcription Factor 1 (HSF1) that binds to the promoters of each of the canonical HSP genes (Wu 1995). HSF1 is a factor of remarkable potency and leads to the rapid induction of abundant levels of HSP mRNA (Bunch et al. 2015; Orosz et al. 1996). Activation of HSF1 involves its trimerization and binding to the promoters of the HSP genes, in each case at motifs close to the start site for transcription (TSS) (Orosz et al. 1996; Voellmy 1994). Each monomer of the HSF1 trimer binds to an individual “GAA” of the heat shock element (HSE) (Wu 1995; Mosser et al. 1988; Somasundaram and Bhat 2000). Thus the HSF1 trimer binds to the inverted

GAA triple repeated HSE sequence. In practice, HSE motifs often diverge somewhat from this sequence but usually contain at least two GAA and TTC repeats tandemly arrayed, and the sequences spaced as in Fig. 2 (Santoro et al. 1998). Remarkably, the three-nucleotide GAA sequence is found many “dawn” phase circadian rhythm genes, suggesting a possible association between HSF1 activity and the warming of the environment at the beginning of the day (Ray et al. 2020). Trimerization of HSF1 during stress involves an array of hydrophobic heptad repeats in the N terminal region of the sequence (known as leucine zipper 1-3, LZ1-3) and a fourth sequence (LZ4) in the C terminal region, embedded within the sequence of the trans activation domain (TAD). In resting conditions, the intrinsic, intramolecular binding of LZ1-3 to LZ4 maintains HSF1 in a transcriptionally silent

(2) HSF1 activation first involves dissociation of HSF1 from Hsp90 and/or Hsp70 followed by its trimerization and binding to the heat shock element (HSE), depicted at the bottom of the figure, located in close proximity to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of stress-inducible, HSF1 regulated HSP genes such as HSPA1A/HSPA1B, HSPB1, BAG3, and HSP90AA1. An additional feature of HSF1 activation and the HSR is the hyperphosphorylation of HSF1

monomeric form (Rabindran et al. 1993; Baler et al. 1993). During heat shock, this association is disrupted and the LZ1-3 domains now free of sequestration by LZ4 are able to self-associate in a triple-stranded hydrophobic repeat and thus lead to stable HSF1 trimerization. Such HSF1 trimer formation permits sequences in the N terminal DBD to bind with high affinity to the HSE sequences in the HSP promoters. The C-terminal TAD domains are then able to interact with the general transcriptional machinery adjacent to the TSS and activate transcription (Wisniewski et al. 1996).
There is also thought to be an additional regulatory domain (REG) within HSF1, C-terminal to the trimerization domain that independently confers stress-inducible activity (Green et al. 1995; Newton et al. 1996) (Fig. 2). This region within HSF1 exerts a repressive influence for HSP transcription in the resting state but becomes strongly trans-activating during heat shock. Studies in multiple organisms have suggested such a twofold mechanism of HSF1 regulation with separate DNA binding and regulatory steps (Nakai 2016; Voellmy 2004). An exact description of HSF1 activation by proteotoxic stress remains, however, uncertain outside of the inducible trimerization that is essential for DNA binding and activity. Roles for feedback regulation of HSF1 by Hsp70, TRiC/CCT, and Hsp90 have been proposed in eukaryotic cells (Zou et al. 1998a; Kijima et al. 2018; Krakowiak et al. 2018; Guettouche et al. 2005; Kmiecik et al. 2020; Zheng et al. 2016; Masser et al. 2019; Neef et al. 2014). In addition, multiple posttranslational modifications by phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination and acetylation have been described, many of which are within the REG domain and may each play roles in HSF1 regulation in some scenarios (Chu et al. 1998; Wang et al. 2006; Westerheide et al. 2009; Anckar et al. 2006; Chou et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2011; Zheng et al. 2018). Phosphorylation in the REG domain by the ERK and GSK3 protein kinases appears to be involved in repression of HSF1 while modifications by PKA and mTORC1 appear to be activating events (Chou et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2003). However, a definitive hypothesis for the mechanism of coordination between the trimerization, DNA binding and regulatory domain has not been coherently developed. This difficulty may reflect the structural flexibility of much of the HSF1 sequence outside of the DNA-binding and trimerization domains, which has led to uncertainties in defining three-dimensional structures and critical residues in HSF1 mediated transcription for many regions of the protein, reviewed in (Prince et al. 2020).
HSF1 may be important in regulating both transcriptional initiation and elongation of HSP genes on binding to HSE in the promoter. Drosophila hsp70 was the first gene shown to be regulated by a process known as posttranscriptional pausing (Adelman and Lis 2012). In this process, transcriptional initiation actually occurs prior to the induction stimulus, and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) then pauses 25–50 base

pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site, attached to a small nascent transcript (Adelman and Lis 2012; Park et al. 2001). The HSP genes are thus poised for immediate activation upon HSF1 induction. Activated HSF1 initiates the relaxation of Pol II pausing and the re-start of transcriptional elongation by a mechanism involving the recruitment of the mediator complex and transcriptional elongation factor pTEFb that can reactivate mRNA transcription of pause HSP gene by Pol II (Lis et al. 2000). Posttranscriptional pausing has subsequently been shown to play roles in regulation of many other genes and is an important component of fast and efficient transcriptional regulation although its regulation is not currently understood in full detail (Adelman and Lis 2012; Bunch et al. 2014). Of interest, TRIM28 was identified to participate in transcriptional pausing of HSPA1B and was also recently found to be one of the most down-regulated proteins after heat-shock (Finka et al. 2015; Bunch et al. 2014).
In addition to ready-to-go transcriptional activation, several other features of HSP gene expression and translation facilitate rapid and robust increases in HSP levels in response to stress. For example, the inducible HSPA1A/ HSPA1B possesses no introns, which reduces the length of the complete transcript and limits the need for mRNA processing. Hsp70-encoding mRNA was also found to be excluded from stress granules, consistent with its continued translation under stress conditions (Kedersha and Anderson 2002). Although codon usage in principle facilitates rates of mRNA translation, the translation of Hsp70 (HSPA1A) mRNA was not found to be favored under heat shock conditions when compared to HSPA8, despite the high GC content of HSPA1A (92%) in the third-codon position to that of HSPA8 (46%) (Kudla et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2021). It may nevertheless still be an important factor considering the reduction in ribosome availability following heat shock. In the case of an acute heat shock, cells utilize HSF1 to initiate dramatic (10- to 50-fold) increased production of stress inducible mRNAs such as the HSPA1A/HSPA1B, HSPB1, HSP90AA1, HSPD1, and DNAJB1 genes that can be readily observed within 3 h of recovery or during an extended 4-h febrile temperature heat shock (Tang et al. 2005; Finka et al. 2015). While substantial increases in the copy numbers of HSPA8 and HSP90AB1 mRNAs can also be observed upon heat shock, the fold change is less dramatic due to the high constitutive expression of these genes (Finka et al. 2015). Increased levels of HSPs in response to stress are further boosted by downstream mechanisms including the stabilization of chaperone mRNAs during stress, a process that greatly extends the lifetimes of these molecules, permitting prolonged expression of HSPs and amplified levels of the chaperones. Indeed, heat shock led to a tenfold increase in stability of Hsp70 mRNA (Tranter et al. 2011; Theodorakis and Morimoto 1987). Stabilization of HSP mRNA is also

accompanied by an increase in lifetime of the HSP proteins themselves through a mechanism involving a block to their degradation by the proteasome and to the ubiquitin ligase CHIP (Qian et al. 2006). HSP levels can, through these multiple mechanisms remain amplified for 72–96 h after stress, leading to pronounced and prolonged thermotolerance (Carper et al. 1987). It is, therefore, clear that the components of the HSR that occur within the cell (cell intrinsic HSR) are eminently adapted to providing a large and prolonged boost in the chaperone cohort that is required for refolding of proteins damaged during proteotoxic stress. It may be significant that Hsp70 and Hsp27 are both powerful inhibitors of programmed cell death and their induction thus may delay stress-induced apoptosis until the proteome has been re-folded under conditions in which high levels of molecular chaperones are maintained and in balance with the chaperoning needs of the cell (Volloch et al. 2000; Garrido et al. 2006). In addition, other modifying mechanisms may be involved in HSP regulation such as miRNA induced reduction in translation (Tranter et al. 2011). Multiple HSP pseudogenes have also been found, molecules that could potentially function as transcriptional regulators if transcribed, and could act as long non-coding RNAs, although the roles of such processes in the heat shock response are currently not clear (Brocchieri et al. 2008; Johnsson et al. 2013).
Other transcription factors besides HSF1 also induce the expression of HSPs and co-chaperones. HSF2 influences neural development and synergizes with HSF1 to increase HSP expression, although this factor does not effectively induce HSP gene transcription on its own (Chang et al. 2006; He et al. 2003). Remarkably, HSF2 protein levels are increased by proteasome and N-terminal HSP90 inhibitors (Prince et al. 2018; Mathew et al. 1998; Kawazoe et al. 1998), suggesting a mechanism by which cancer cells may overcome proteotoxic stress. Moreover, expression of stressinducible Hsp90α has been found to be promoted by the factors STAT5 and NF-kB (Ammirante et al. 2008; Perotti et al. 2008). Myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF1) has recently been shown to increase the expression of Cdc37 in prostate cancer cells, while SCAND1 prevents this induction through direct interaction with MZF1 (Eguchi et al. 2019).
Protein form and function: a matter of life
that is challenged by proteotoxic conditions
The tertiary structure of proteins is key to their function and activity, and collectively across the proteome operable levels of protein conformations are critical to cell viability. Yet achieving and maintaining functional protein structures pose formidable and constant challenges for cells. For example, the means by which nascent polypeptides are able to reach their functional states in a matter of seconds despite

the impossibly large-scale of alternatives, as highlighted by Levinthal’s paradox, is both remarkable and yet to be fully understood (Levinthal 1969, 1968; Zwanzig et al. 1992). Current models describe the acquisition of native functional conformations to be favored across a ‘funnel-shaped’ energy landscape of possible arrangements that is defined by the amino acid sequence and influenced by the folding environment (Balchin et al. 2016; Anfinsen 1973; Smock and Gierasch 2009). Studies that have indicated an energy bias towards certain residue–residue arrangements and evidence to suggest that proteins fold in segments of ‘foldon’ units of approximately 20 amino acids have provided possible foundations by which proteins can fold to functional forms on the observed timescales (Zwanzig et al. 1992; Englander and Mayne 2014; Bai et al. 1995). Protein structures are dynamic and various energetically favored conformations are continuously ‘sampled’. The spectrum of conformational states populated by a protein, termed an ‘ensemble’, and the relative distributions of which are occupied across time are key to a respective protein’s function and activity (Smock and Gierasch 2009; Motlagh et al. 2014). Despite the proficiency in which cells manage protein folding, maintaining cellular proteins within their native ensemble of functional forms is a constant challenge. The high concentration of biomolecules within the cell makes non-canonical interactions with other molecules that may divert a protein from its native ensemble almost inevitable (Braselmann et al. 2013; Dill et al. 2011). In addition, the cell can experience physical, chemical, and biological conditions that interfere with protein folding, alter the ensemble of already folded proteins, and also lead to non-canonical protein interactions and activities. For example, changes in temperature have an acute effect upon protein folding. The energy landscape upon which a folding polypeptide chain falls is governed by the relative entropy and enthalpy transfers associated with the positioning of the amino acids with respect to adjacent amino acids within the same chain, and interaction with surrounding amino-acids, biomolecules, ions, and water molecules. These events are by their nature dependent upon the temperature of the cellular system. For example, the local order of intracellular water alters with temperature such that the energetic favoring of relative arrangements of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues alters as temperatures increase or decrease (Rhee et al. 2004) (Brandts and Hunt 1966). A significant and acute increase in temperature, a ‘heat shock’, is predicted to dramatically alter the energetic landscape of protein folding within the cell and lead to massive protein aggregation. For human cells, heat shock above 40 °C is toxic if maintained for an extended period, and cell death increases with increasing temperature (Dickson and Calderwood 1976). The mechanisms involved in heat-induced cell toxicity were not originally clear, until the thermodynamic studies of Dewey et al. identified protein structure

1 3

as the target of heat shock and protein denaturation as the proximal toxicity of the thermal stress (Dewey et al. 1994). These findings related to the temperature range 40–48 °C (Dewey et al. 1994), although targets in addition to proteins seemed to be present at higher temperature ranges. Studies since then have further established that cells can tolerate increases in temperature up until a ‘catastrophic’ collapse in the structural integrity of the proteome (Dill et al. 2011). Taken together, cellular life is dependent upon protein form and function, maintenance of which is both facilitated and challenged by intracellular conditions, and subject to extracellular factors such as temperature.
Early studies that examined the toxic effects of high temperature also identified another phenomenon—heat-induced thermal resistance or thermotolerance that was observed in all cell types examined (Gerner and Schneider 1975; Li et al. 1982; Delaney 1990). A molecular basis for this phenomenon was made when acquisition of thermotolerance was shown to be mediated by the induced expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and a key role for HSPs in the heat shock response (HSR) became accepted (Subjeck et al. 1982a). Studies that found induction of the HSR by heat to also protect cells against other forms of stress indicated the general cytoprotective features of HSPs (Lindquist and Craig 1988). The induced expression of HSPs is now an established component of cellular stress responses (CSR) to various chemical, biological, and physical conditions and thus these molecular chaperones play roles in broad areas of toxicology (Finka et al. 2011; Gupta et al. 2010). Here we review the physiological functions of HSPs and their roles in cellular responses to cytotoxic conditions. We also highlight aspects of the HSR that are yet to be fully understood.
HSPs co‑operate to maintain and regulate protein
form and function.
The principle property, shared by the molecular chaperones of different families, is the ability to recognize and bind to exposed hydrophobic residues in client proteins (Gething 1996). The exposure of such regions of hydrophobic polypeptide sequence to an aqueous and polar solvent, such as the intracellular fluid, is highly destabilizing to protein structure and can lead to aggregation of the polypeptides. This event can be toxic for the cell either through the loss of essential protein functions, or the gain of toxic, non-canonical oligomer or aggregate activities (Salomons et al. 2009; Zhang and Calderwood 2011) (Ross and Poirier 2005). Hydrophobic residues are typically internalized into the core of native tertiary conformations of globular proteins where they have limited potential to initiate aggregation or other non-canonical interactions (Clerico et al. 2015; Kalinowska et al. 2017). Non-internalized hydrophobic residues that are accessible for binding can, therefore, be indicative

of non-native folding states and are rapidly occupied by molecular chaperones for ‘holding’ or further processing. While the native protein structure is energetically favored, polypeptides can become ‘kinetically trapped’ at stages of the native ‘on’ folding pathway or proceed down a nonnative ‘off’ folding pathway (Varela et al. 2019). Molecular chaperones co-operate to direct proteins in such non-native states to a series of ATP-dependent chaperone systems that include Hsp70, and Hsp90 and the TRiC complex, that each possess refolding activity and can return proteins to a native ‘on’ folding pathway, as discussed below. By occupying hydrophobic residues, molecular chaperones further facilitate the folding process by ‘guarding’ against non-specific interactions with other cellular proteins in the concentrated lumen of cellular compartments, and thereby protect the native folding pathway from diverting forces. Hydrophobic interfaces can also mediate functional protein events such as complex assembly, oligomerization, or ligand binding. Prior to such events occurring, the hydrophobic interfaces are frequently ‘held’ or ‘chaperoned’ by HSPs until the HSPsubstrate association is outcompeted by the native ligand or binding event. An example of such a scenario is the constitutive association of steroid receptors with Hsp90, in which the receptor dissociates from Hsp90 upon binding of the hydrophobic steroid ligand (Renoir et al. 1986; Sanchez et al. 1986).
The functions and regulation of the major HSP groups
The Small HSPs in protein chaperoning
Individual molecular chaperones carry out unique, specialized functions to maintain proteostasis and these are coordinated within the broader protein folding network. The sHsps such as Hsp27 act as “holdases” and stably bind to exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of non-native conformers, thereby preventing the formation of tight protein aggregates that would restrict salvation of individual polypeptides (Arrigo and Gibert 2012; Cox et al. 2018; Ungelenk et al. 2016). Hsp27 itself is strongly induced by heat shock while other sHSP members of the family appear to play minimal roles in the HSR (Tang et al. 2005). The sHsps exist as monomers, dimers, and higher molecular weight oligomers, the transition between which are key to their chaperone functions and the level of oligomerization is regulated by redox conditions and phosphorylation (Alderson et al. 2019; Carra et al. 2019; Ehrnsperger et al. 1997; Haslbeck and Vierling 2015; Ecroyd et al. 2007). Binding of sHsps to non-native substrates was recently found to occur early in the unfolding process at a near-native state, an interaction that prevents further unfolding and thereby facilitates the likelihood that the substrate can return to its native ensemble upon resumption

of normal conditions (Ungelenk et al. 2016; Ehrnsperger et al. 1997). Of note, the monomeric form of Hsp27 exhibits an enhanced ability to restrict aggregate formation and was found to be favored under reducing conditions, although also having potential to self-aggregate (Alderson et al. 2019). In this sense Hsp27 oligomers were proposed to be steady-state reservoirs of Hsp27 monomers; they were envisaged as harboring the monomers in a form that avoids self-aggregation but that is also readily available to be released for association with non-native proteins (Alderson et al. 2019). In addition to protecting against aggregation, some sHsps mediate the formation of large complexes of non-native intermediates termed ‘sequestromes’ and can themselves become incorporated into protein aggregates, an event which alters the properties of the aggregate and facilitates its later disaggregation (Mogk et al. 2018). For example, Ungelenk et al., found the eukaryotic Hsp42, to actively promote the formation of aggregates under stress conditions, where it was found to be incorporated into the aggregate and prime for subsequent solubilization (Ungelenk et al. 2016). Recent work has highlighted that at least some forms of heat-induced protein aggregation are more regulated and to even possess beneficial functions. Thus sequestration of cellular proteins into chaperone-associated aggregates transiently protects against accumulating irreversible levels of denaturation or unsalvageable aggregate arrangements (Cabrera et al. 2020). The chaperoning activities of the sHsps are achieved in an ATPindependent manner and they do not possess the capacity to readily release themselves from their clients. The chaperone and chaperoned ‘client’ protein must therefore be rescued by members of the ATP hydrolyzing Hsp70 family proteins (Ehrnsperger et al. 1997; Rauch et al. 2017).
The Hsp70 complex in protein chaperoning.
The powerfully stress-induced Hsp70 proteins bind client proteins via a substrate/client binding domain with two possible polypeptide binding sites (Li et al. 2020). The most rigorously characterized polypeptide binding site shows preference for heptapeptide sequences with a core of two to five aliphatic residues bordered by positively charged residues such as the known Hsp70 ligand NRLLLTG (Clerico et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 1996; Swain et al. 2007; Rudiger et al. 1997b). Structural and peptide binding studies have indicated that leucine, the amino acid with the most hydrophobic side chain, is the most chemically compatible with occupation of the Hsp70 substrate binding cleft (Zhu et al. 1996; Rudiger et al. 1997b). Leucine is featured amongst sequences identified by algorithms designed to predict Hsp70 substrates (Rudiger et al. 1997b; Gutierres et al. 2020; Durme et al. 2009), although Hsp70 can also bind a large variety of heptapeptide amino sequences (Gutierres et al. 2020). Acidic residues are disfavored from the Hsp70 heptapeptide

binding motif (Rudiger et al. 1997b; Durme et al. 2009), and were also recently shown to be the least likely to mediate protein aggregation, and also less likely to be incorporated into the hydrophobic core of globular proteins (Koopman and Rudiger 2020; Houben et al. 2020). During co-translational folding, Hsp70, therefore, binds regions of the nascent polypeptide that are destined to be internalized into the hydrophobic core of the native protein form, which are the regions that are also at most risk for aggregation (Koopman and Rudiger 2020; Houben et al. 2020). Amino acid sequences recognized by the prokaryotic Hsp70 ortholog DnaK across a cohort of peptides derived from various origins were found to occur statistically every 36 residues with more ideal heptapeptide motifs occurring every 84 residues (Rudiger et al. 1997b). Thus Hsp70 molecules which participate as a part of the co-translational machinery can bind hydrophobic domains in polypeptides emerging from the ribosome at regular and frequent intervals. Consistent with this property, Hsp70 has a large interactome and multiple Hsp70 molecules can bind a single client simultaneously (Willmund et al. 2013). While a minority of proteins appear to be able to fold without assistance from chaperones, a predominant subset of eukaryotic proteins require Hsp70 for co-translational folding (Willmund et al. 2013). The exact mechanism by which Hsp70 is able to catalyze substrate folding/refolding is subject to ongoing study, although evidence to date indicates that binding of Hsp70 pauses progression of the folding sequence as a stage where the protein exists at an immature structural form (Moran Luengo et al. 2018), or that Hsp70 binding partially ‘unfolds’ and retains mature client substrate proteins in a repressed state to regulate the temporal-spatial activity of the client protein (Sharma and P. De los Rios, P. Christen, A. Lustig, and P. Goloubinoff, 2010; Kirschke et al. 2014). In order for the protein to reach the functional state, the hydrophobic amino acids bound to Hsp70 are required to be positioned into the interior of the protein’s native tertiary conformation. This can only occur upon Hsp70 dissociation, which allows the Anfinsen folding sequence to continue, either unaided or facilitated further by Hsp90 or the TRiC complex (Balchin et al. 2016; Moran Luengo et al. 2019, 2018). However, if a non-native form becomes adopted or further re-modeling is required, Hsp70 is proposed to re-bind and at least partially unfold the malfolded substrate. This mechanism would afford another opportunity to assume the native state upon re-release (Moran Luengo et al. 2019; Sharma and P. De los Rios, P. Christen, A. Lustig, and P. Goloubinoff, 2010). Proteins that are post-translationally translocated to the ER or mitochondria are also dependent upon association with multiple Hsp70 paralogs to maintain a linear immature protein form. This process not only facilitates import by the respective organelle receptors and import channels but may also prevent inappropriate protein activity prior to

the protein being trafficked to its native destination (Becker et al. 1996; Deshaies et al. 1988). In addition to facilitating the formation of correct protein conformations and helping direct proteins to their appropriate cellular locations, Hsp70 proteins can also promote proteostasis by blocking inappropriate protein–protein interactions and through quality control or degradation of non-native ensembles. For example, by association of Hsp70 with aliphatic binding motifs, Hsp70 averts aggregation of its substrates with other hydrophobic entities (Rudiger et al. 1997a). Beyond blocking inappropriate protein–protein interactions, Hsp70 can further protect against aggregation by reducing the cellular population of polypeptides in a non-native, aggregation-prone tertiary state via its ability to catalyze protein refolding (Rudiger et al. 1997b). In a third Hsp70-mediated protective process against protein aggregation, Hsp70 proteins can target nonnative protein species for degradation via several means. For example, Hsc70 recognizes variations of the KFERQ consensus pentapeptide motif and directs damaged proteins for destruction via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a process that is amplified under certain stressful conditions (Kaushik and Cuervo 2018). Individual proteins presenting with serially non-native conformations are directed to proteasomal degradation by Hsp70, a process facilitated by the Hsp70 co-chaperones and ubiquitin ligases CHIP and UBQL2, or they can be destroyed via CMA (Kaushik and Cuervo 2018; Stankiewicz et al. 2010; Hjerpe et al. 2016). Hsp70 also provides a rescue mechanism undertaken when aggregates do form; Hsp70 can extract polypeptides incorporated into protein aggregates, thereby acting to inhibit aggregate formation and expansion, or alternatively, may facilitate aggregate destruction by chaperone assisted selective autophagy (CASA) (Mogk et al. 2018; Arndt et al. 2010). Therefore, through its ability to bind hydrophobic amino sequences, Hsp70 functionally connects key components of the proteostasis network and performs several major processes ascribed to molecular chaperones; protein folding and refolding, protein transport, complex assembly/disassembly, protection against aggregate formation, de-aggregation, aggregate degradation, and degradation of proteins with non-native tertiary structures.
It remains to be determined how exactly Hsp70 is able to mechanically ‘unfold’ client substrates to permit refolding. Early studies suggested that the Hsp70 substrate binding domain (SBD) encapsulated the client in a linearized form which would demand physical separation of the bound amino motif from the adjacent polypeptide chain structure. However, studies that followed found that Hsp70 may also bind substrates in a manner not requiring such linearization of the client (Rudiger et al. 1997a; Zhu et al. 1996; Schlecht et al. 2011). Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in understanding the key events that regulate the Hsp70 functional cycle (Morgner et al. 2015; Sarbeng et al.

2015; Takakuwa et al. 2019; Trcka et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2020a; Kityk et al. 2015). Exposed hydrophobic residues are bound by Hsp70 via the hydrophobic cleft formed by a series of beta-strands of the SBDβ subdomain and stabilized by several alpha helicies (subdomain SBDα) that form a ‘lid’ structure over the cleft (Fig. 3) (Bertelsen et al. 2009). Structural studies have shown Hsp70 to be a highly dynamic molecule that undergoes significant allosteric changes between substrate-bound and unbound states that are coupled with a cycle of ADP and ATP nucleotide exchange (Swain et al. 2007; Bertelsen et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2020b; Meng et al. 2018). The most distinct allosteric states of Hsp70 relate to the relative positions of the NBD and SBD, and of the SBDα to the SBDβ subdomain (Fig. 3). The SBD transitions between being bound to or ‘docked’ upon the NBD and ‘undocked’ in a more linearly extended form. The SBD undocked conformation is most associated with the ADP-bound state as this mode is most populated by ADP-bound homologs of Hsp70, including DnaK, BiP, and Ssc1, although the ATP-bound human Hsp70s can also exist in the SBD undocked conformation (Bertelsen et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2020b; Meng et al. 2018). Similarly, human ADP-bound Hsc70 and Hsp70 were also found to exist in both SBD docked and undocked conformations (Meng et al. 2018). The SBD ‘open’ conformation exposes the hydrophobic substrate binding cleft and exhibits fast on/ off client binding and is often associated with the ‘docked’ ATP-bound conformation (Fig. 3). The SBD ‘closed’ conformation is typical of ADP-bound DnaK and many Hsp70 orthologs, although it was recently found that the human Hsp70 SBD can also be closed when ATP-bound, in a proposed ATPase-stimulated state (Wu et al. 2020b). Wu et al. recently described a model where Hsp70 sequentially transitions through a series of heterogeneous conformational states in its ATP-fueled chaperone cycle, the progression of which is facilitated by association with an Hsp40 co-chaperone and substrate binding (Wu et al. 2020b). Furthermore, the model proposes that Hsp40 arranges the formation of ATP-bound Hsp70 into anti-parallel dimers which then promotes ‘undocking’ of the SBD and conversion to the ADPand substrate-bound state with a ‘closed’ SBD (Wu et al. 2020b). The formation of anti-parallel dimers has also been described for other Hsp70 species such as DnaK, BiP and Hsc70. However, the distribution of conformational states which they populate appear to be distinct between these proteins (Morgner et al. 2015; Trcka et al. 2019; Meng et al. 2018). For example, human inducible Hsp70 was found to preferentially exist as a dimer in the presence of ATP (Wu et al. 2020b), although, ADP-bound Hsp70 can also exist as a dimer in heterocomplex with substrate protein, Hsp40 and Hsp90 (Morgner et al. 2015). The Hsp70 chaperone cycle is also regulated by nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) that include HSP110, HspBP1, and BAG family proteins that

Fig. 3  Hsp70 ATPase cycle. Hsp70 binds to hydrophobic residues of substrate clients, an event that is facilitated by proteins of the Hsp40/ DnaJ family. Hsp40 and substrate binding catalyze an allosteric change in Hsp70 and its ATPase activity, where Hsp70 then adopts a high-affinity, ADP-bound state with low on/off substrate turnover. This state is stabilized by HIP and is associated with the SBDβ domain adopting a closed conformation. Nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) including BAG3, BAG1, Hsp110, and HspBP1 catalyze the

release of ADP and of the client substrate, upon which time the folding of client substrate can continue. The cycle continues with Hsp70 next adopting an ATP-bound state associated with high substrate client on/off binding and release. In this form, the SBDβ domain populates an open conformation and the SBDα ‘lid’ is ‘docked’ to the N-terminal ATPase domain. The cartoons of Hsp70 shown here are derived from the Hsp70 ortholog DnaK structures 2KHO and 4B9Q (Bertelsen et al. 2009; Kityk et al. 2012)

catalyze ADP exchange for ATP and release of the client protein from Hsp70 (Rauch and Gestwicki 2014; Raviol et al. 2006; Dragovic et al. 2006; Rauch et al. 2016; Kabani et al. 2002; Shomura et al. 2005). Of note, the BAG family member Bag3 may confer other properties when associated with Hsp70. BAG3 interacts with a range of signaling pathways through its PxxP, IPV, and WW motifs (Colvin et al. 2014). In contrast, the co-chaperone Hsp70 Interacting Protein, HIP (ST13) stabilizes the Hsp70-ADP client bound state and can act as a tumor suppressor (Li et al. 2013a;

Nollen et al. 2001; Sossey-Alaoui et al. 2002). Together these interactions support a model where Hsp70 dimers (1) bind heptameric amino sequences within the client of single peptides ~ 86 amino acids apart, (2) release from the client with the heptamers still in close proximity to each other and, (3) thus allow the hydrophobic residues to properly associate and nucleate mediating structural maturation of the tertiary structure. In this scenario, the Hsp70-cochaperones would be required to do the following: recruit clients to Hsp70, arrange the structure of the co-chaperone-bound complex,

1 3

and coordinate the ATP-fueled chaperone cycle in a temporal and spatial manner allowing for optimal protein folding.
After undergoing chaperoning by Hsp70 the client, depending on its folding state, may be released into the cytosol as a functional protein or may be handed off to other chaperone machines, such as Hsp90 and TRiC/CCT. However, if the client cannot be effectively folded due to mutation, truncation, post-translational modification or lack of chaperone activity the client is next ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase CHIP (STUB1) and directed for proteasomal degradation (Seo et al. 2019). Such quality control pathways ensure that misfolded proteins that could interfere with critical biological processes are removed from the proteome. The transfer of clients from Hsp70 to the Hsp90 chaperone machine is organized by the co-chaperone HOP (STIP1) (Hernandez et al. 2002; Scheufler et al. 2000; Alvira et al. 2014). Both CHIP and HOP possess tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that bind to C-terminal EEVD motifs found in both Hsp70 and Hsp90. These competing interactions, mediated through the EEVD motifs create a checkpoint in which the fate of the client protein is determined: ubiquitination and destruction via CHIP or further folding mediated by Hsp90 through Hsp70 binding to HOP. It is believed that client proteins shared by both Hsp70 and Hsp90 are delivered to Hsp90 through a mechanisms involving simultaneous binding of EEVD motifs in the C-terminal tails of both HSPs by HOP. Such handoff of client proteins from Hsp70 to Hsp90 is generally believed to be unidirectional, although the mechanism is not completely confirmed.
The Hsp90 chaperone machine
The Hsp90 machine consists of an Hsp90 dimer surrounded by a coterie of co-chaperones that facilitates its ATP-fueled chaperone activity in a similar manner to Hsp70 (Biebl and Buchner 2019). However, for Hsp90 the ‘closed’ slow on/ off client binding conformation is associated with ATPbinding, while the ‘open’ fast on/off client release conformation is associated with the ADP-binding (Fig. 4) (Prince et al. 2015). This mechanism thus runs counter to the Hsp70 ATPase client binding cycle and suggests that the opposing ATPase cycles may help coordinate chaperone activity as suggested by recent evidence that Hsp90 can facilitate Hsp70 nucleotide exchange and client release (Kirschke et al. 2020).
Hsp90 folds and maintains a large population of information processing protein clients and is often referred to as the signal transduction chaperone (Kamal et al. 2003; Calderwood and Neckers 2016). In humans around 60% of protein kinases, 30% of E3-ligases and 7% of transcription factors are known to be Hsp90 clients (Taipale et al. 2012). Currently, the most studied client proteins are the steroid hormone receptors and both Hsp70 and Hsp90 regulate their

activity. Biophysical characterization of the glucocorticoid receptor ligand binding domain (GR-LBD) has shown that Hsp70 binds and maintains GR-LBDs in a repressed/infantilized state until it can be handed to Hsp90 via HOP and thus activated (Kirschke et al. 2014; Noddings et al. 2020). Hsp90 functions as a dimer held together by its C-terminal domains (CDs), which allow the middle client-binding domains (MDs) and N-terminal ATP-binding domains (NDs) considerable flexibility. On association with the GRLBD, Hsp90 occupies an ‘open’ v-shaped conformation that allows an extended peptide of the client to occupy a cleft created by the joining MDs (Noddings et al. 2020). This Hsp90 client-binding space is less hydrophobic than the Hsp70 client-binding domain (Moran Luengo et al. 2018). Hsp90 may bind ATP in this client-loading conformation, and once ATP and GR-LBD are bound the NDs dimerize as beta-sheets from each ND are swapped placing Hsp90 into a ‘closed’ circle conformation. This interaction is followed by further compaction of the Hsp90 dimer into a ‘clamped’ Figure 8-shaped conformation (Fig. 4) (Prodromou et al. 2000; Hessling et al. 2009; Cunningham et al. 2012; Ali et al. 2006). This ATPase component client-binding ‘locked’ conformation is stabilized by the association of the co-chaperone, p23 (PTGES3) (Ali et al. 2006), which directly interacts with the GR-LBD (Noddings et al. 2020). Ironically, p23 also assists in the production of prostaglandins indicating a role in both anti- and pro-inflammatory processes (Tanioka et al. 2003). Steroid ligand binding by GR is activated when HOP and Hsp70 are displaced from the Hsp90 dimer by other TPR-containing co-chaperones such as PP5, CYP40, FKBP51 and FKBP52 (Riggs et al. 2004; Conde et al. 2005). These co-chaperones assist in client maturation by removing post-translational modifications and peptidyl-prolyl isomerization (Biebl and Buchner 2019; Riggs et al. 2004). FKBP52 also directs trafficking of the Hsp90-GR complex to the nucleus through its interaction with microtubule-associated dynein/dynactin motors (Galigniana et al. 2010; Zgajnar et al. 2019). Hsp90 ND dimerization and hydrolysis of ATP is driven by the co-chaperone Aha1 in a sequential manner (Retzlaff et al. 2010). Aha1 affects the dwell time that each Hsp90 protomer remains in its ‘closed’ client-binding conformation (Koulov et al. 2010). This process results in asymmetric conformations of the Hsp90 dimer as it folds the client protein. When both molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed to ADP and each phosphate is released the NDs of Hsp90 “undimerize” and transition into the ‘open’ v-shaped client release conformation (Biebl and Buchner 2019). The folded/mature client protein or ligand bound GR is then free to carry out its biological functions. Hsp90 is now ‘open’ and may load a new client protein and repeat the folding cycle of further reducing nonspecific hydrophobic interaction, allowing proper arrangement of tertiary and quaternary protein structures. Inhibitors that target the ND ATP-binding

Fig. 4  Hsp90 ATPase cycle. Hsp90 client substrates can be transferred from Hsp70 via HOP or may be recruited independently of the Hsp70 complex by co-chaperones such as Cdc37. Hsp90 functions as a dimer that exhibits a twisted ‘figure-8’ structure with high affinity for its client substrate when in an ATP-bound state. The formation of this structure is facilitated by the Hsp90 co-chaperone Aha1 and is stabilized by p23. Aha1 catalyzes Hsp90 ATPase activity which even-

tually promotes adoption of the open dimer form shown at the bottom of the cycle. This open conformation has low client affinity thereby permitting release of the client. The cartoons of Hsp90 shown here are derived from the E. coli Hsp90 ortholog HTPG structure 2IOQ and S. cerevisiae Hsp90 structure 2CG9 (Ali et al. 2006; Shiau et al. 2006)

cleft lock Hsp90 into this ‘open’ conformation, thereby prevent client folding and induce client degradation, reviewed in (Taldone et al. 2020; Fuhrmann-Stroissnigg et al. 2018; Schwartz et al. 2015; Koren and Blagg 2020).
Recruitment of other clients to Hsp90 may be directed by several co-chaperones besides Hop. Cdc37 is a co-chaperone involved in chaperoning protein kinases along with the androgen receptor (Taipale et al. 2012; Gray et al. 2008; Rao et al. 2001; Grammatikakis et al. 1999). Protein kinases use ATP as a donor to attach phosphate groups to substrate proteins a key mechanism for transducing signals that regulate progression through the cell cycle, for differentiation, for responses to cell stimuli such as stress and many more processes. Hop binds to Hsp90 in a mechanism mutually

exclusive of Cdc37 (Siligardi et al. 2002), although Hop and Hsp70 may in themselves aid kinase folding and maturation along a parallel process (Biebl et al. 2020). The conserved dual lobe ATP-binding clefts characteristic of many kinase domains are structurally unstable and require Cdc37 to load them on to Hsp90 in order to be folded (Verba et al. 2016). Cdc37 recognizes motifs on both lobes of kinase domains that bind across the inside lumen of the paired Hsp90 MDs (Prince and Matts 2004), indicating that Cdc37 is needed for aligning the kinase lobes which may contain extensive regulatory sequences between them (Gray et al. 2008). RPAP3 is another dual TPR domain protein capable of binding Hsp70 and Hsp90 (Rodriguez and Llorca 2020; Benbahouche Nel et al. 2014). A component of the R2TP complex, RPAP3

links Hsp90 to the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases and PIH1D1 (Rizzolo et al. 2017). This large chaperone machine specializes in in the assembly of multi-component complexes such as RNA polymerase II, small ribonucleoproteins and complexes containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinaserelated protein kinases (PIKKs) such as ATM, ATR, DNAPK and mTOR (Paci et al. 2012; Munoz-Hernandez et al. 2019; Gauthier et al. 2018).
The TRiC chaperone complex
Protein folding within the cytosol and nucleus also involves the T-complex protein-1 ring complex (TRiC) which is comprised of a series of eight chaperone containing T -complex protein-1 proteins (CCT1-8) (Frydman et al. 1992). The eukaryotic TRiC complex is a mega structure of ~ 1MDa arranged as two back-to-back barrel-like/ring-shaped TRiC units each containing 8 CCT proteins of the 60kda chaperonin HSP family. Substrates enter the lumen of the TRiC complex via a gap formed by the apical domains of the CCT subunits, and rearrangement of the client conformation is thus able to occur within a protected folding environment (Yam et al. 2008). Each of the CCT molecules hydrolyzes ATP, an event that is coupled with a conformational change in each subunit that ultimately alters the ‘ring’ shape (Yam et al. 2008; Cuellar et al. 2019). Upon entering the lumen of the TRiC complex, the substrate is exposed to the hydrophobic residues of the CCT molecules. Next, upon ATP hydrolysis there is a conformational change in the CCT residues facing the TRiC lumen creating a less hydrophobic and more polar/positively charged surface, compared to the ATP-associated conformation (Frydman et al. 1992). This change in the chemical surface of the TRiC lumen is proposed to be one method in which TRiC mediates ATPcoupled rearrangement of the client protein (Frydman et al. 1992; Yam et al. 2008). The process of substrate recruitment to TRiC and ATP hydrolysis is facilitated by the cochaperone prefoldin (Gestaut et al. 2019). Examination of TRiC substrates found fibrillary proteins such as tubulin and actin to be dominant, although TRiC was found to interact with approximately 6–7% of the eukaryotic proteome (Yam et al. 2008; Grantham 2020). Consistent with a key role for TRiC in actin maturation or maintenance, TRiC expression was found to have greater importance to maintaining proteostasis in the muscle cells of metazoan organisms relative to other cell types (Guisbert et al. 2013). Other client proteins of TRiC have also been identified and both the complex and individual CCT monomers are protective against various forms of aggregation-prone proteins (Grantham 2020). The TRiC complex co-operates with Hsp70 to coordinate folding of nascent polypeptides from the ribosome. A recent study by Stein et al. described an apparent hierarchical relationship whereby Hsp70 recognizes more linear hydrophobic

regions and TRiC binds preferentially to the topological hydrophobic surfaces of more mature polypeptides (Stein et al. 2019). TRiC and Hsp70 may further facilitate correct protein folding by influencing the rate of protein translation at the ribosome (Stein et al. 2019).
Mitochondrial and ER resident chaperones
Homologous counterparts of nuclear/cytosolic HSPs are localized to other cellular compartments and perform analogous chaperoning functions within the organelles they occupy. For example, the 60-kDa chaperonin Hsp60 and its co-chaperone Hsp10 are massively induced by heat shock and are localized to the mitochondria, sharing a functional relationship that parallels the prokaryotic GroEL/GroES system (Tang et al. 2005; Bukau and Horwich 1998). In addition to Hsp60 and Hsp10, other mitochondrial HSPs include the Hsp70 family protein Mortalin (encoded by HSPA9), and TRAP of the Hsp90 family. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), another distinct but related chaperone network exists, which includes the Hsp70 member BiP/Grp78 (HSPA5), Grp94 (HSP90B1), and the large HSP Grp170 (HYOU1) (Ma and Hendershot 2004). No chaperonin paralogs have been detected in the ER despite the presence of fibrous proteins such as collagens, produced by some cells. In these cases chaperoning is carried out by Hsp47 (SERPINH1) (Ito and Nagata 2017). The mitochondrial Hsp60 and ER chaperone BiP can be induced by proteotoxic stressors such as heat shock, although the heat shock response primarily manifests in the cytosol while the ER chaperones respond to the unique conditions found within that organelle and possess their own independent transcriptional regulatory mechanisms (Finka et al. 2011, 2015; Ma and Hendershot 2004). Cells, therefore, require the expression of a range of chaperones with different roles in the protein folding cascade and are specialized to different cellular compartments to ensure functional proteomes that can be maintained according to the respective conditions in each compartment (Lindquist and Craig 1988; Ma and Hendershot 2004; Ellis and Hartl 1996).
The chaperone network in stress and disease
It has become increasingly apparent that HSPs operate in a coordinated manner within the broader proteostasis and chaperome networks to achieve their chaperone functions. The natures of molecular switches that determine where a client substrate is directed along the folding cascade, such as from Hsp70 to Hsp90, or Hsp70 to proteasome are largely unknown. In the case of Hsp70 clients, the fate of the chaperoned client is likely directed by the nature of the co-chaperone that recruits the substrate to the chaperone. HSP substrate destinations may also be determined by the

1 3

1955

duration of association with the HSP complex. (Hjerpe et al. 2016). The stoichiometric ratio between the ATPhydrolyzing HSPs and their co-chaperones also appears to be a factor in determining the distribution of substrate destinations. For instance, the relative abundance of CHIP was found to be tenfold less than that of Hsp40 in cultured immortalized human cells, thus favoring the recovery/ refolding of Hsp70 substrates as opposed to their degradation (Finka and Goloubinoff 2013). Of note, it has been calculated to be 1000-fold more energetically favorable to refold a non-native protein than to destroy and re-synthesize (Sharma and P. De los Rios, P. Christen, A. Lustig, and P. Goloubinoff, 2010). Protein–protein interactions between elements of the chaperone network are further specified by differential affinities between Hsp70, Hsp90 and their respective co-chaperones, and binding of certain co-chaperones can exclude the binding of others, for example the mutual exclusivity of Aha1 and p23, or Cdc37 and HOP binding to Hsp90 (Freilich et al. 2018). Distinct combinations of co-chaperones can also have specific protein refolding and ATPase consequences (Rauch and Gestwicki 2014). Post translational modifications may also direct HSP substrates. For example, phosphorylation of the C-termini of either Hsp70 or Hsp90 was shown to favor protein folding via their association with Hop, as opposed to substrate degradation through association with CHIP (Muller et al. 2013). The relative concentrations of cooperating chaperones also appears to be an important regulatory component in HSP chaperoning activities (Kmiecik et al. 2020; Moran Luengo et al. 2018), as well as association with other chaperone molecules. For example, some HSPs including Hsp70 and Hsp110 can form heterodimers to function as disaggregase complexes, other HSPs form homodimers, oligomers, and other heterogenous complexes of various sizes that influence their chaperoning activities and may be regulated by phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Takakuwa et al. 2019). PTMs are emerging as significant regulatory modifications for both individual HSPs and the chaperome network. Indeed, the influence of PTMs upon the function of the chaperome network and individual chaperones is referred as the ‘chaperone code’ (Cloutier and Coulombe 2013). For example, the molecular chaperone properties of Hsp27 are critically regulated by its phosphorylation by the kinase MK2, catalyzing a modification that plays a key role in determining the size of Hsp27 oligomers and their protein folding ability (Arrigo and Gibert 2014, 2012). Hsp70 undergoes multiple phosphorylation events that may influence substrate and nucleotide binding and fine tune the chaperone activities of the protein (Cloutier and Coulombe 2013; Nitika and A.W. Truman 2017; Rigo et al. 2020). Likewise, multiple PTMs have been detected

in Hsp90 that appear to modify chaperoning function (Mollapour et al. 2011a, 2011b).
Molecular chaperones and co-chaperones, which together constitute the chaperome, are highly interactive components in the protein folding pathways in which they associate transiently to facilitate the gradual maturation of clients and then dissociate from each other and the client (Balch et al. 2008b). Brehme et al.showed the chaperome in neuronal cells to be comprised of many proteins in addition to the core chaperones, including over 300 proteins (Brehme et al. 2014) (Fig. 5). The chaperoning power and resistance to acute proteotoxic stress of a cell population seems a clear function of HSP levels and the acute expansion of the whole HSP cohort after heat shock renders cells extremely resistant to further bouts of proteotoxic stress (Richter et al. 2010; Carper et al. 1987; Subjeck et al. 1982b). A role for overall levels of HSPs is, by analogy, predicted to play roles in some of the diseases of aging, with expanded HSP expression fueling malignant transformation and progression and declines in HSP levels in neuronal cells permitting protein folding disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (Brehme and Voisine 2016; Calderwood and Gong 2016; Lang et al. 2019). However, the proteotoxic stress response involves multiple, sometimes competing pathways, including chaperoning and refolding of unfolded proteins and proteolysis of the malfolded polypeptides through the proteasome and autophagy pathways (Calderwood et al. 2009). Chaperones may, therefore, play differing roles in protein folding disorders as illustrated by the findings that Hsp90 may facilitate some of the pathophysiological events occurring in tauopathies by stabilizing disease related aggregates (Luo et al. 2007; Blair et al. 2013). A particularly prominent role for chaperoning, notably by Hsp70, in maintenance of neuronal cells and prevention of neurotoxicity has been described (Zhang et al. 2011; Brehme and Voisine 2016).
In contrast to most normal cells and tissues in which chaperones and co-chaperones interact transiently to fold their clients, it was found that tightly associating complexes within the chaperome, known as the epichaperome were observed in some cancers (Rodina et al. 2016) (Fig. 5). Core components of the epichaperome were Hsc70 and Hsp90, although a large array of co-chaperones and other proteins were observed in the complexes (Rodina et al. 2016). The epichaperome was thought to confer survival advantages to the malignant cells and inhibition of Hsp90 by specific Hsp90 drugs was toxic mainly to cancers in which occurrence of the epichaperome was observed (Wang et al. 2019). These findings were perhaps foreshadowed by the studies of Kamal et al. showing altered association of Hsp90 with clients in cancer (Kamal et al. 2003). In addition to participating in cancer, expression of the epichaperome increased with the progression in experimental models of Alzheimer’s disease in the Hippocampus, and inhibitors of assembly of this complex had a therapeutic

Fig. 5  Summary of the protein–protein interaction network of the chaperome genes. The network was build using the STRING database (https://​string-​db.​org) from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). In the network the nodes shows the most important protein folding genes and their interaction networks. An insular disposition of the interac-

tion network is observed on the left, while, under stressful stimulus, the nodes become tightly connected into an intricate complex named Epichaperome, a transient and dynamic multi-protein arrangement of the chaperome that enhances homeostasis and cellular survival under stressful conditions

effect in terms of cognitive function and occurrence of the epichaperome complexes that again contained Hsc70 and Hsp90 (Inda et al. 2020). Tendency to form the epichaperome was thus associated with morbidity in diverse disease states. Formation of stable epichaperome complexes in Parkinson’s disease could be mediated by perturbation of oxidative metabolism associated with the pathology of the disease as well as genetic changes that predispose to the disease (Kishinevsky et al. 2018). Under stress there was participation of the Hsp70 co-chaperones (HOP and CHIP) as well as Hsc70 and Hsp40 members in formation of the epichaperome (Kishinevsky et al. 2018). The authors of these studies emphasized that the properties of the epichaperome were largely independent of total chaperone concentrations, in contrast to the situation in normal molecular chaperone activity, in which HSP concentrations determine stress sensitivity (Sciandra and Subjeck 1984; Oh

et al. 1997). Inhibition of epichaperome stability using the Hsp90 drug PU-H71 led to loss of the increases in STAT3 and NF-kB signaling that were associated with the pathology of Parkinson’s disease (Oh et al. 1997). Thus, changes in the strength of association of members of the proteome, in a disease state-specific manner, during the stresses promoting pathophysiological change may play key roles in the underlying pathology.
Extracellular chaperones and the non‑cell intrinsic heat shock response
The proteotoxic stress response was originally thought of as a cell intrinsic reaction to polypeptide unfolding, in which abundant transcriptional activation maintained high levels of

intracellular free chaperones (Richter et al. 2010). However, recent studies have shown both cell intrinsic and extrinsic components of the response that together may constitute a coordinated chaperoning system within tissues. This idea is exemplified by considering the properties of one individual chaperone, Hsp90. Cytosolic heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in mouse and human is expressed as two orthologs, including Hsp90α, powerfully induced by proteotoxic stress and Hsp90β, a constitutive chaperone (Calderwood and Neckers 2016). The constitutive Hsp90β chaperone is involved in maintaining “housekeeping” intracellular protein folding, an essential component of cell survival and longevity. A large proportion of the cytosolic Hsp90α is secreted into the extracellular spaces where it binds to receptors on cells, undergoes endocytosis, and plays profound roles in wound healing, tumor metastasis, and the immune response (Calderwood 2018; Li et al. 2007; Tsen et al. 2013; Murshid et al. 2010, 2019). In addition to mediating cell signaling through receptors, secreted Hsp90 may also penetrate the cytosol of target cells, boosting chaperone power. The homeostatic properties of Hsp90 are thought to play a significant role in longevity. In contrast to mammalian Hsp90, in C. elegans, only one ortholog is encoded—DAF-21 but this protein likewise plays a key role in deterrence of aging (Somogyvari et al. 2018).
The chaperones may function in the intra- and extracellular spaces by initiating both transmembrane signal transduction and chaperoning of unfolded extracellular proteins. Indeed, mechanisms for chaperone secretion and target cell binding/uptake have been described (Mambula and Calderwood 2006; Asea et al. 2000, 2002; Chalmin et al. 2010; Eguchi et al. 2018b; Lancaster and Febbraio 2005; Li et al. 2013b). These data illustrate the dynamic behavior of chaperones that operate intracellularly in the folding cascade, can be secreted by donor cells and taken up by acceptor cells which may result in receptor-mediated signaling networks and increased folding power that critically depends on absolute chaperone levels. It is not clear as yet to what extent extracellular chaperone secretion may be a scheduled component of the mammalian HSR, although all the components seem to be in place for such a system to be operative (Eguchi et al. 2018b; Mambula et al. 2007; Calderwood et al. 2016; Theriault et al. 2006). For instance, in neuronal tissues, HSPs can be secreted by glia and taken up by neurons, resulting in increased cell survival of the neurons (Habtetsion et al. 2018; Tidwell et al. 2004). It is also possible that long range trafficking of HSPs between tissues occurs and, offering some support for this hypothesis, significant levels of these proteins have been observed in the circulation (Pockley et al. 2002; Pockley 2002). The stage is thus set for exploring the potential role of cell to cell or organ to organ transfer of molecular chaperones in cell survival, health, and longevity.

A remarkable property of Hsp90 ortholog DAF-21 in C. elegans is that depletion of this chaperone in one tissue such as neuronal cells leads to a reciprocal depletion in others such as gut or muscle through a process called transcellular chaperone signaling (TCS) (Oosten-Hawle et al. 2017; Oosten-Hawle and Morimoto 2014). Stimulation of the HSR or perturbation of Hsp90 levels in neuronal cells involved a complex regulatory interaction in initiating cells that was dependent on the GATA family transcription factor PQM-1 and the innate immune receptor CLEC41. These changes were then transmitted, by as yet unknown agents, to acceptor cells in distant organs that underwent increases in Hsp90 levels and were protected from protein malfolding. One complication of the signaling system was that increased levels of Hsp90 in target cells suppressed local activity of HSF1 and the HSR through its feedback repressive effects on the factor (O’Brien et al. 2018; O’Brien and Oosten-Hawle 2016). Functionally similar findings were observed in Drosophila, in which increased expression of Hsp70/Hsp40 led to protection against protein aggregation in a distant organ by exosomal transport (Takeuchi et al. 2015). These studies, therefore, indicate complex non-intrinsic intercellular components to the proteotoxic stress response that may act to protect distant tissues in which the intrinsic response is less active.
Toxicology of the Heat Shock Response; the protective properties of HSPs against toxic protein stress
Throughout this review we have considered cellular ‘stress’ as a condition that leads to sub-optimal cellular function that if not resolved over an extended time, has negative consequences for cell and/or organism physiological fitness. We have also considered acute or severe stress conditions as ‘toxic’ if they reduce cell and/or organism viability and function when not resolved. Such stress-induced toxic outcomes may manifest at the molecular level via damage to macrostructures such as the plasma membrane, damage to macromolecules such as DNA, RNA or protein, or the disruption of key proteostatic processes. Here we discuss how various forms of stress can lead to disrupted proteostasis, contexts of stress where cells respond by synthesizing HSPs, and examples of toxic stress where HSPs have been shown to promote survival.
Chemical compounds that perturb key proteostatic processes such as chaperone or proteasome function activate HSF1 and stimulate increased HSP expression (Mathew et al. 1998; Kawazoe et al. 1998; Bagatell et al. 2000). This phenomenon illustrates the concept that maintaining proteostasis within the cell is a constant process that is dependent upon multiple cellular systems, and that when disrupted,

1 3

1958

Archives of Toxicology (2021) 95:1943–1970

the cell activates the HSR to compensate. The value of this concept is further illustrated by the additive toxicity associated with simultaneous inhibition of multiple proteostatic processes, such as proteasome activity and HSP synthesis, when compared to inhibition of one of these systems alone (Wang 2011). Moreover, the toxicity associated with compounds that target elements of the proteostatic network can be mitigated by the cells activating the HSR in response to the proteostatic imbalance that ensues and genetic targeting of the HSR sensitizes cells to inhibitors of the proteostasis network (Bagatell et al. 2000; Zaarur et al. 2006).
Divalent heavy metals such as Mercury, Cadmium, and Lead, and the metalloid Arsenite induce proteotoxic stress via perturbing the native folding pathway of nascent proteins and induce activation of the HSR (Tamas et al. 2018; Wirth et al. 2002; Razo et al. 2001). Nascent polypeptides appear to be more susceptible to the proteotoxic effects of heavy metals compared to mature folded proteins, possibly due to such ions disrupting protein folding by complexing with, catalyzing the oxidation of, or substituting other ions in functional amino groups, which are more exposed in linear protein conformations, reviewed in (Tamas et al. 2014). In contrast, Chromium [Cr(VI)] was found to induce proteotoxic stress by mRNA mistranslation (Holland et al. 2007) and can have diverse effects upon the expression of HSPs, as reviewed in (Ferreira et al. 2019).
Alcohols including as ethanol, propanol, benzyl alcohol, and heptanol also activate the HSR (Balogh et al. 2005; Delmas et al. 1998; Nagy et al. 2007; Pignataro et al. 2007). One mechanism in which alcohols may promote proteotoxicity and subsequent HSR activation is by disrupting ordered solvation of hydrophobic sidechains and by stabilizing denatured protein forms at higher concentrations (Brandts and Hunt 1966). In addition, an alternative mode of HSR activation was proposed for certain alcohols such as benzyl alcohol where the compound was found to disrupt cholesterol distribution in the plasma membrane though a membrane-linked, protein-denaturing-independent HSR activation mechanism (Nagy et al. 2007). Oxidative stress associated with ethanol metabolism could also contribute to HSR activation via production of ROS and altered membrane fluidity (Toth et al. 2014; Sergent et al. 2005).
Various forms of oxidative stress activate synthesis of HSPs and HSF1 trimerization, and prior activation of the HSR confers greater tolerance to oxidative stress insults (Spitz et al. 1987; Jornot et al. 1991; Zou et al. 1998b; McDuffee et al. 1997). Key events that contribute to the toxicity of oxidative stress include DNA strand breaks, chemical modification of proteins, and lipid peroxidation; however, due to their relative abundance within the cell, proteins are considered to be the predominant targets (Dahl et al. 2015; Corcoran and Cotter 2013; Davies 2005). Oxidative stress disrupts proteostasis in multiple ways; first,

reactive oxygen species (ROS) can directly react with the peptide backbones, amino termini, or residue side chains leading to their oxidation and modified chemical properties, and subsequent altered protein stability, and/or degradation. The sulfur-containing side chains of cysteine and methionine are the most readily oxidized, which can be reversed by cellular redox systems; however, they can also become hyperoxidized to irrecoverable forms (Dahl et al. 2015; Corcoran and Cotter 2013). Other amino acids can also be subject to oxidation, as reviewed in Corcoran and Cotter (2013). Oxidative stress can also disrupt proteostasis through inactivation of key regulatory systems within the PN such as the proteasome and ubiquitin ligases (Shang and Taylor 2011). Proteotoxic stress and lipid peroxidation are proposed to be the primary methods by which oxidative stress activates the HSR, reviewed in Patinen et al. (2019). Some initiators of oxidative stress such as ­H2O2 appear to be a weaker activator of the HSR compared to heat shock or other forms of proteotoxic stress (Jornot et al. 1991; Lee and Seo 2002; Bruce et al. 1993). For example, H­ 2O2 caused a mild induction of Hsp70 synthesis in both rate and magnitude compared to an equally toxic heat shock treatment (Spitz et al. 1987). Notably, NRF2 was also found to regulate Hsp70 under oxidative stress, suggesting NRF2 and/or other TFs may be additional or alternative positive regulators of HSPs in response to oxidative stress (Hensen et al. 2013).
Other perturbations to the cellular environment have also been found to activate HSF1 trimerization and/or the synthesis of HSPs. These include mechanical stress (Xu et al. 2000), osmotic stress (Burg et al. 2007; Fiorenza et al. 2004; Shim et al. 2002), hypoxia (Baird et al. 2006; Iwaki et al. 1993), metabolic stress (Iwaki et al. 1993), and acidosis (Narasimhan et al. 1996). While HSF1 was observed to be responsive to an acute change in osmolality, the same conditions did not lead to activation of Hsp70 mRNA expression (Caruccio et al. 1997). Other studies showed a linear increase in osmolality to induce Hsp70 expression more efficiently than an immediate increase, and Hsp70 induction in response to osmotic stress to be dependent upon nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) in mammalian cells (Cai et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2002). Intracellular acidification upon heat shock was recently shown to be an important factor for heat-induced activation of the HSR in eukaryotic cells (Triandafillou et al. 2020). The authors demonstrated that while reduced intracellular pH alone was not sufficient to activate the HSR, simultaneous inhibition of cytosolic acidification and protein translation during heat shock was sufficient to block activation of the HSR, indicating that in addition to temperature, these cellular states are also important determinants of HSR activity (Triandafillou et al. 2020). Of note, intracellular acidification and altered glutathione:GSSH ratios (intracellular redox state) occur during multiple forms of cellular stress known to activate the HSR and, therefore,

1959

distinct cell stressors can disrupt multiple physio-chemical conditions within the cellular protein folding environment (Zou et al. 1998b; Triandafillou et al. 2020; Yao and Haddad 2004).
A range of physio- and pathophysiological states are also associated with activation of the HSR and various forms of protein stress. Fever, infection, and inflammation are generally synonymous with HSF1 trimerization and induction of HSP synthesis, although both increases and decreases in HSP expression have been reported to occur in various models of bacterial and viral infection (Lang et al. 2016; Singh and Hasday 2013). HSF1 DNA-binding can be observed at febrile temperature ranges of 38.5–41 °C along with modest induction of HSP synthesis that increases further with extended exposure time from 1–24 h. However, induced levels of Hsp70 mRNA and protein increase sharply upon temperatures reaching 42 °C (Tulapurkar et al. 2009). Induction of Hsp70 by febrile temperatures can be further heightened by toll-like receptor agonists including LPS or the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (Gupta et al. 2013). Hsp70 expression can also be induced in human monocytes in response to LPS alone, inactivated streptococci, and TNF (Fincato et al. 1991). Other possible signals that stimulate activation of the HSR pathway during infection may include ROS produced by activated neutrophils and macrophages and/or cytotoxic cytokines (Obrador et al. 1998). The production of HSPs in inflammatory contexts may act to promote the survival capacity of host tissues (Mehlen et al. 1995; Jaattela et al. 1992). For example, heat shock of cultured cells was shown to be protective against TNF-induced cytotoxicity, leading authors to propose that febrile temperatures may provide protection of non-virally infected cells against TNF via induction of HSPs, while virally infected cells that have reduced capacity to produce HSPs remain susceptible to TNF-induced cytolysis (Jaattela et al. 1989). HSPs have a myriad of immunological activities that include antigen uptake, antigen processing, and modulation of inflammatory responses (Murshid et al. 2019). Conversely, there are several examples of bacterial and viral pathogens that can utilize host cell HSPs to their advantage, for example host cell HSPs may facilitate various stages of viral replication cycles, reviewed in Santoro et al. (2009), and the membrane translocation or maturation of bacterial cytotoxins (Steinemann et al. 2018; Haug et al. 2003). Some bacterial HSPs have also been found to mitigate host immune responses and may thereby provide some advantage in escaping immune mediated destruction (Borges et al. 2018).
Conditions that cause proteostatic imbalance can, therefore, be expected to induce some level of HSR activation, although the sensitivity and kinetics involved appear to be distinct for different forms of stress (Alford and Brandman 2018). For many of the forms of proteotoxic stress discussed above, an increase in the abundance of HSPs can mitigate

their toxic effects (Mehlen et al. 1995; Jaattela et al. 1992; Huot et al. 1996, 1991; An et al. 2008; Amin et al. 1996). Reciprocally, decreasing HSP and/or HSF1 abundance or activity by mutation can lead to increased sensitivity to stress in eukaryotic cells (Zaarur et al. 2006; Shim et al. 2002; Jaattela et al. 1992; Xiao et al. 1999; Marber et al. 1995; Sanchez et al. 1992; Hunt et al. 2004; McMillan et al. 1998). Induced expression of HSPs upon preconditioning is also key for enhanced tolerance to subsequent stress insults including cross-tolerance between different types of stress (Shim et al. 2002; Sanchez et al. 1992; McMillan et al. 1998). The HSR pathway can, therefore, be considered a determining factor that impacts the toxicity of diverse cellular conditions. The relative abundance of HSPs can influence the cells’ capacity for survival and stress tolerance on multiple levels. First, by the mechanisms discussed above, higher levels of HSPs provide the cell enhanced ability to manage stress-induced non-native proteins and protein aggregates, and thereby increase the cells capacity to maintain a functional level of proteome integrity (Fig. 6). Second, HSPs such as Hsp70 and Hsp27 are negative regulators of cell death pathways, and via this mechanism, increases in these HSPs favor cell survival (Ravagnan et al. 2001; Paul et al. 2002; Chauhan et al. 2003; Li et al. 2000; Stankiewicz et al. 2005; Yamagishi et al. 2006). This latter effect may be best represented by HSPs protecting against types of toxic stress that are not potent inducers of HSP expression, for example ­H2O2, radiation, and certain cytotoxic agents including staurosporine (Huot et al. 1996, 1991; Hunt et al. 2004; Paul et al. 2002; Yamagishi et al. 2006; Erdos and Lee 1994; Kim et al. 1993; Sierra-Rivera et al. 1993).
In terms of what cellular changes lead to stress-induced HSF1 activation and HSP expression, it is presumed that an important activating event is an increased abundance of non-native protein conformations. However, some studies that have shown forms of stress to induce HSF1 activation at levels below comprehensive protein denaturation have suggested that other signals such as membrane fluidity, increased intracellular ­Ca2+ concentrations and associated kinase signals to be key positive regulators in the HSF1 activation cascade (Balogh et al. 2005), or that temperature itself is a signal-independent of denatured proteins (Triandafillou et al. 2020). Increases in C­ a2+ concentrations and/or altered membrane fluidity have been reported for several conditions known to activate the HSR including heat shock, ROS, and alcohol exposure, and ­Ca2+ was shown to be a key factor for HSF1 activation (Balogh et al. 2005; Price and Calderwood 1991). While the events that occur upon HSF1 activation are increasingly well defined, the mechanism by which HSF1 ‘senses’ an increase in non-native proteins remains to be fully understood. Recent studies in budding yeast have provided mechanistic evidence for Hsp70 to be titrated from HSF1 during

Fig. 6  Sequential protein folding reactions after proteotoxic stress. (1) Proteins can become unfolded, aggregated and non-functional after proteotoxic stresses, leading to loss of viability. Aggregated proteins may pose a hazard for cell vitality in themselves. Refolding leads to rescue of cells and resistance to stress. In reaction (2) denatured proteins are recognized by Hsp27 complexes that can bind exposed hydrophobic sequences and prevent aggregation. This step is followed by reaction (3) in which Hsp70 rescues the Hsp27-client complex in an ATP-dependent reaction. This reaction leads to association of the client with Hsp70 and co-chaperones such as Hsp40 and HIP (and others including HspBP1, Bag1, and Bag3 not shown in cartoon). The client—Hsp70 complex then encounters Hsp90 and

co-chaperone HOP leading to formation of a further, intermediate complex (reaction 4) mediated by HOP, which can bind both Hsp70 and Hsp90, and in which the client is directly associated with Hsp90. In a further ATP-dependent step (5), Hsp70 and co-chaperones dissociate from the complex and Hsp90, co-chaperones including Cdc37, p23 and immunophilins become associated in this folding complex. On completion of protein folding in this complex, Hsp90 and the cochaperones dissociate from the mature, functional protein which can then go on to carry out enzymatic or other roles, independently of chaperoning in the cytosol or nucleus. An essentially similar pathway is involved in the folding of nascent proteins after being exuded from ribosomes

stress-induced accumulation of non-native proteins and thereby releasing HSF1 from an inhibitory association with Hsp70 (Krakowiak et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2016; Masser et al. 2019). However, the regions within yeast HSF1 identified to be important for the HSF1-Hsp70 interaction are not conserved in mammalian HSF1 (Krakowiak et al. 2018). Despite this, Hsp70, Hsp90, and the TRiC/ CCT complex may also participate in regulating HSF1 activity by a similar titration mechanism in mammalian cells (Zou et al. 1998a; Neef et al. 2014). Neef and colleagues highlighted the possibility that HSF1 may be occupied by these different chaperone complexes under basal conditions in a cell- or tissue-specific manner (Neef et al. 2014). Of importance to the chaperone titration model for

HSF1 regulation, a recent study by Alford and Brandman indicated that different forms of stress may lead to preferential occupation of Hsp90 or Hsp70 by non-native protein intermediates by leading to subsequent HSF1 activation (Alford and Brandman 2018). This suggests the possibility that cohorts of Hsp90, Hsp70, and TRiC/CCT complexes may harbor inactive HSF1 simultaneously, the proportions of which may vary by cell/tissue type and be differentially sensitive to distinct forms of proteotoxic stress. Interestingly a similar chaperone titration mechanism by non-native proteins is proposed within the ER with the titration of BiP from the UPR effectors ATF6, IRE1, and PERK by misfolded proteins during ER stress (Cao and Kaufman 2014).

Perspective
There is increasing evidence that molecular chaperone expression and co-operation may be dysregulated in various disease conditions and in aging. Exploiting these differences for treatment would involve targeting the molecular chaperones. Progress in this area will require a detailed understanding of the heat shock response. At this stage in our knowledge the following facts are known:
(1) The cell intrinsic heat shock response in eukaryotes was originally identified as a rapid reaction to proteotoxic stresses such as heat shock, leading to swift, abundant and prolonged expression of HSPs, coordinated by HSF1, and affording profound resistance to toxicity. Upon surviving the stress, HSP levels then return to basal levels as HSF1 becomes repressed and normal transcriptional patterns resume. The functionality of the response, including both its induction and repression phases, are required for the health of cells and tissues. Unscheduled elevations in HSP expression are associated with proteotoxic conditions or malignancy while the folding disorders of aging appear to involve a decline in the heat shock response.
(2) An intact chaperome is required for healthy metabolism. Under normal conditions, chaperones and cochaperones comprising the chaperome interact transiently to mediate successive rounds of protein folding or to move chronically unfolded clients towards the pathways of proteolysis. Under the stressed conditions that accompany the degenerative diseases of aging, more stable interactions between the chaperome members are observed and these structures have been labeled as the epichaperome. The epichaperome appears to be involved in the progression of cancer, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease and when targeted resolution of the diseases is observed.
(3) There is increasing evidence to indicate that chaperones and co-chaperones can be released from cells, bind to the secreting cell or associate with target cells and then be taken up by these cells. Chaperone binding may impact the immune response, wound healing and malignancy. Long range effects of the chaperones within organisms may be possible as these proteins have been found in significant concentrations in the circulation. There is also evidence for the coordinated transcription of HSP genes in cells in distant organs— transcellular chaperone signaling, in which activation of the HSR in one cell triggers activation in distant tissues through a complex signaling interaction. This system may comprise an active component of the pro-

teotoxic stress response, permitting folding capacity to be coordinately regulated by HSPs in different organs.
Future advances
The heat shock response likely evolved early in evolution, in single cell extremophiles, permitting survival in those unstable microenvironments. Our task has been to explore the deployment of this program in multicellular organisms in which individual cells, although inhabiting a more stable milieu, live for extended lifetimes as organisms develop, mature, age and eventually die. We will attempt to predict likely advances in the next decade, keeping in mind of course that the future is largely unknowable.
– The HSR is primarily a transcriptional response and thus efforts will continue to understand the mechanisms through which HSF1 senses exposure to proteotoxic stress and becomes transcriptionally competent. Increased understanding of HSF1 ultrastructure, the nature of regulatory PTMs and understanding of the nature of triggering of trans-elongation of paused polymerase will likely advance.
– The exact mechanisms of protein folding and homeostasis by HSPs and co-chaperones are being elucidated at a rapid rate and are likely to be further elaborated in the next few years.
– It has become clear that intracellular molecular chaperones do not function solely as individual factors and understanding how HSP networks operate in the HSR is likely to further evolve. In addition, as recent studies indicate that, under pathological conditions, tangles of multiple chaperones can become enmeshed in high molecular weight complexes known as epichaperomes, and that such structures can play roles in disease phenotypes, advances in understanding how such bodies form and harm tissues are predicted.
– Studies in invertebrates indicate that the HSR may not be a wholly cell intrinsic response and may involve transcellular cooperation and signaling between distant tissues. In addition, HSPs have been increasingly shown to operate in the extracellular spaces. Future studies may reveal the scope and significance of these long-range interactions between cells and secreted HSPs.
– The massive multicellular colonies that comprise mammalian tissues and organisms encompass a range of microenvironments that form, mature and decay with lifetime. Most cells remain locked in place in tissues and decay with time, while others may escape regulation, dedifferentiate and evolve into malignant tumors. A major challenge for us will be to determine the role of
