We perform molecular dynamics simulations of water conﬁned between atomically detailed hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and heterogeneous (patchy) nanoscale plates. We study the effects of temperature 220 e T e 300 K on conﬁned water’s behavior at various pressures -0.2 e P e 0.2 GPa and plate separations 0.5 e d e 1.6 nm. Combining this with our earlier results on the same system [Giovambattista, N.; Rossky, P. J.; Debenedetti, P. G. Phys. ReV. E: Stat., Nonlinear, Soft Matter Phys. 2006, 73, 041604; Giovambattista, N.; Rossky, P. J.; Debenedetti, P. G. J. Phys. Chem. C, 2007, 11, 1323], where pressure was varied at constant temperature, allows us to compare water’s behavior in nanoscale conﬁnement, upon isobaric cooling and isothermal compression, corresponding to paths of interest in protein denaturation. At a ﬁxed temperature, water conﬁned between hydrophobic plates can form vapor, liquid, or crystal (bilayer ice) phases, depending on the values of P and d. The P-d phase diagrams at T ) 300 K and T ) 220 K show that cooling suppresses the vapor phase and stabilizes the liquid and crystal phases. The critical separation dc(P), below which vapor forms, shifts to lower values of d and P upon cooling. The density proﬁles show that, upon cooling, water approaches the hydrophobic plates. Hence, the effective hydrophobicity of the plate decreases as T decreases, consistent with the suppression of the vapor phase upon cooling. However, both the orientation of water’s molecules at the interface and the water contact angle on the hydrophobic surface show practically no temperature dependence. Simulations of water conﬁned by heterogeneous plates decorated with hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches reveal that cooling leads to appreciable blurring of the differences between water densities at hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. This observation, together with remarkable similarities in conﬁned water’s response to isobaric cooling and to isothermal compression, suggests that the invasion of hydrophobic cavities by water is an important mechanism underlying both pressure and cold denaturation of proteins.

I. Introduction
The behavior of water in nanoscale conﬁnement is relevant to many scientiﬁc ﬁelds and technological applications. For example, the selectivity and permeation of biological ion channels depend sensitively on the hydration of the ions and of the inner surface of the channel,1-3 friction between surfaces can be greatly altered by the presence of an intervening water layer which can act as a lubricant,4-6 and the capacitance of an electrical double layer can be increased by reducing the electrode pore size to the point of distorting interfacial water structure.7 Understanding the phase behavior, as well as the structural and dynamic properties of water conﬁned at the nanoscale, is a complex task in part because water’s behavior can be profoundly inﬂuenced by the chemical and geometric properties of the conﬁning surfaces. As a result, water in conﬁnement exhibits a rich behavior that can be very different from that observed in the bulk. A striking example is the observation that nanoscale conﬁned water can freeze at 300 K,8 as anticipated by simulations.9

Water plays a key role in many self-assembly processes in chemical and biological systems (e.g., refs 10-12). Nanoscale hydrophobic objects immersed in aqueous solutions may attract each other via a water-mediated interaction, referred to as “hydrophobic interaction”.13-19 Many processes, such as membrane and micelle formation20-23 and protein folding,24 are driven by such interactions. In these cases, the aggregation of hydrophobic units gives rise to complex structures.12,25-34 These selfassembly processes are manifestations of the behavior of water molecules at interfaces and in conﬁned geometries. Understanding water’s behavior under these conditions is necessary for a quantitatiVe description of hydrophobic interactions.35
Hydrophobic interactions depend sensitively on the solute36,37 and on solution properties.38,39 In particular, thermodynamic conditions can greatly affect the strength of hydrophobic interactions.40,41 For example, in addition to the well-known phenomenon of thermally induced unfolding, proteins denature upon cooling at constant pressure (cold denaturation) and upon compression at constant temperature (pressure denaturation). Figure 1 shows a schematic phase diagram associated with the typical conformational stability of the folded (native) state of globular proteins (see, e.g., ref 42). The solid line in Figure 1 separates the limited range of states where the protein has the characteristics of the native fold from the remaining regime of

The black line separates thermodynamic states of the protein in its folded (native) and unfolded (denatured) states.

non-native, unfolded states. Blue and red arrows indicate the thermodynamic paths corresponding to cold and pressure denaturation, respectively. It is believed that an important contribution to protein denaturation in these processes is the weakening of the effective attraction between buried hydrophobic residues and the associated penetration by water between hydrophobic contacts.
The weakening of (water-induced) hydrophobic interactions along the thermodynamic paths indicated in Figure 1 is a direct consequence of the effects of pressure and temperature on interfacial and conﬁned water. In previous work,43,44 we have studied the effects of pressure on the behavior of water conﬁned by nanoscale silica-based structured walls. The thermodynamic path considered in these investigations corresponds to the red arrow in Figure 1, at a temperature of T ) 300 K. In the present work, we study the effects of temperature on the behavior of water under conﬁnement. The thermodynamic path considered here corresponds to the blue arrow in Figure 1. In order to compare quantitatively how pressure and temperature affect water’s behavior in nanoscale conﬁnement, we consider the same model system and simulation techniques implemented in refs 43 and 44. Because interfacial properties are quite sensitive to the chemical and geometric characteristics of the surfaces to which water is exposed and to the details of the simulation method,45,46 studies in which the behavior of the same water model and surface representation is investigated over a broad range of thermodynamic conditions, as we do here and in ref 43, are necessary for improving fundamental understanding of the physical chemistry of water in nanoscale conﬁnement.
This work is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the simulation details. The results for hydrophobic plates are presented in Section III. This section includes a discussion of conﬁned water phase behavior and the thermal expansion coefﬁcient (Section III.A), water structure (Section III.B), and the relationship between water contact angle, surface hydrophobicity, and interfacial water structure (Section III.C). Results for water conﬁned by hydrophilic plates are reported in Section IV. The behavior of water conﬁned between heterogeneous plates is discussed in Section V. A summary of our results is presented in Section VI.
II. Simulation Details
We perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a system comprising two identical ﬁnite nanoscale plates, with a deﬁned relative geometry, immersed in water. We consider a cubic system sample of side length L > 4.7 nm and plates with

Giovambattista et al.
dimensions 3.215 × 3.217 × 0.866 nm3. The plates are immobile and are located symmetrically, with respect to the center of the box, parallel to the x-y plane. The system contains N ) 3375 water molecules, and periodic boundary conditions are applied along the three dimensions.
Simulations are performed in the NPT ensemble for plateplate separations 0.5 e d e 1.6 nm, temperatures 220 e T e 300 K, and pressures -0.2 e P e 0.2 GPa. The temperature and pressure are controlled with a Berendsen thermostat/ barostat.47 The lowest temperature simulated T ) 220 K corresponds to the estimated melting temperature of ice Ih in the model used here (SPC/E48) at P j -0.01 GPa (at -0.1 j P j 2 GPa, the stable crystal phase of the model is ice II).49 The plate-plate separation is deﬁned as the distance between the planes that contain the hydrogen atoms of the hydrophilic plates43 (see discussion below). In the case of hydrophobic plates, the same planes (where the hydrogen atoms would be hypothetically located) are used to deﬁne d. The conﬁned volume is deﬁned as Vconf ) dA, where A ) 3.215 × 3.217 nm2 is the plate area. The density in the conﬁned volume is Fconf ) mH2ONconf/Vconf, where Nconf is the number of molecules found in Vconf, and mH2O is the mass of a water molecule.
The plates are atomically detailed and are described in detail in ref 43. Brieﬂy, they are composed by SiO2 tetrahedra arranged so as to represent an idealized structure of β-cristobalite.50,51 The plates can be hydrophobic or hydrophilic. In the hydrophobic plate case, atoms have no partial charges and interact with water molecules only through short-ranged repulsive and dispersive (Lennard-Jones) interactions. Hydrophilic plates have all of the surface sites hydroxylated, with surface Si, O, and H atoms carrying partial charges (see ref 43 for details); these plate atoms interact with water molecules through both dispersive and electrostatic interactions. Electrostatic interactions are treated using the Ewald sum technique.52,53
Simulations are performed for different time intervals depending on temperature. Simulation times at T ) 300 K are given in ref 43 and are in the range 200 ps-1 ns. Simulation times at T ) 280, 260, 240, and 220 K are 1, 1.5, 2.5, and 5 ns, respectively. These simulation times appear long enough to avoid nonequilibrium artifacts in our measurements. For comparison, we note that the structural relaxation times in bulk SPC/E water at F ) 1.0 g/cm3 are τbulk ≈ 5, 17, and 125 ps at 260, 240, and 220 K, respectively,54 so that even at the lowest temperature, the simulation time is about 40τbulk. Only the last part of the simulations is used for calculations: 0.3-1 ns (T ) 280 K), 0.7-1.5 ns (T ) 260 K), 1.5-2.5 ns (T ) 240 K), and 3.0-5.0 ns (T ) 220 K). We note that, as in our earlier work,43 we cannot rule out that some of the conﬁned phases observed here may be metastable.55 We assign these states and phases in a practical sense, as determined by the simulation time scale. The accurate calculation of true phase equilibrium loci (binodal lines) in conﬁnement is the subject of ongoing work and will be reported in future publications.
III. Results: Hydrophobic Plates
In this section, we present our observations of phase behavior and thermal expansion in hydrophobic conﬁnement and analyze the consequences of varying temperature for an interfacial water structure.
A. Phase Behavior and Thermal Expansion. Figure 2 summarizes the observed phase behavior of nanoscopically conﬁned water at (a) T ) 300 K (adapted from ref 43) and (b) T ) 220 K. At both temperatures, bulk cavitation is observed at sufﬁciently low pressure, i.e., the liquid outside the conﬁned

Figure 2. Phase behavior of conﬁned water as a function of pressure and separation between nanoscale hydrophobic plates. (a) T ) 300 K (from previous work ref 43). (b) T ) 220 K. Filled circles indicate liquid-state points. Empty squares indicate vapor-state points at which capillary evaporation occurs in the conﬁned Volume (i.e., we observe no water molecule between plates). For d ≈ 0.6-0.7 nm, a bilayer crystal between the plates is formed at both temperatures, indicated by red × symbols. The continuous black line separates approximately the vapor-phase region from the liquid and ice regions and suggests a schematic phase diagram based on the simulation results. The vertical dashed line indicates the limit of stability of bulk liquid water; cavitation occurs at all values of P and d on the left of this line (diamond symbols). Lowering the temperature shifts the vapor-region boundary (black line) to lower values of P and d.

space develops vapor bubbles, consistent with instability of the bulk liquid. At T ) 300 K and P e -0.1 GPa, bulk cavitation occurs simultaneously with cavitation in the conﬁned volume. However, at P ) -0.05 GPa, cavitation in the conﬁned volume develops ﬁrst, and this induces cavitation in the bulk. The same phenomenon occurs at T ) 220 K, but at lower pressures: simultaneous cavitation, inside and outside the conﬁned space, occurs at P ) -0.15 GPa; cavitation in the conﬁned volume, followed by bulk cavitation, is observed at P ) -0.1 GPa.
Figure 2a indicates that water in the conﬁned volume at T ) 300 K can exist in the vapor, liquid, or crystal phase depending of the values of d and P. The crystal phase, a bilayer ice,43 forms over a narrow range of separations d ) 0.6-0.7 nm and P > 0.05 GPa. The black line in the ﬁgure indicates the approximate boundary between the vapor phase, at low P and d, and the liquid and crystal phases, at higher P and d. We note that water outside the conﬁned volume remains in the liquid phase (at P > -0.05 GPa; see Figure 2a) and is in coexistence with the vapor, crystal, or liquid in the conﬁned volume.43
Figure 2b summarizes the results obtained at T ) 220 K. The main differences between Figures 2a and b are the shift of the vapor-region boundary (black line) to lower values of d and P as the temperature is decreased and the broadening (lower P, larger d) of the region of stability of bilayer ice. The vaporregion boundary line closely approaches the bulk-cavitation region at T ) 220 K; only at P ) -0.05 GPa and d ) 0.5 nm a vapor forms between the plates (coexisting with bulk liquid water). The conﬁned vapor phase is restricted to increasingly smaller plate separations with cooling, leading to a nearly complete loss of the hydrophobically induced evaporation transition in the conﬁned volume. Figure 2b also shows that, for ﬁxed separation d, the domains of stability of both the liquid and bilayer ice expand to lower pressures upon cooling.
Figure 3 shows the density of water conﬁned between hydrophobic plates at different temperatures and ﬁxed pressure P ) -0.05 GPa. We also include results for water conﬁned between hydrophilic plates as well as for bulk water.54,56,57 The density in both conﬁned systems increases upon cooling. The density of water conﬁned by hydrophilic surfaces is larger than in hydrophobic conﬁnement, but still smaller than that of bulk water at the same thermodynamic conditions. The difference in density between water in hydrophilic and hydrophobic conﬁnement becomes substantially smaller upon cooling, consistent with a gradual blurring of differences between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity at low temperatures (see also

Figure 3. Average density, F, as a function of temperature in the conﬁned volume. Results for water conﬁned by hydrophobic and hydrophilic plates are shown. The separation between plates is d ) 1.6 nm and the external pressure is P ) -0.05 GPa. For comparison, results for bulk water are also included (data adapted from refs 54, 56, and 57). Lines are a guide to the eye and are obtained by ﬁtting the data using second-order polynomials.
Section V). We observe no density maximum in water under hydrophobic or hydrophilic conﬁnement at P ) -0.05 GPa, while bulk simulations using the SPC/E water model do show a density anomaly over the range of pressures -0.125 j P j 0.15 GPa.56 At P ) -0.05 GPa, we see that the density is a weak function of temperature, and a bulk density anomaly, which is only marginally within the error bars, is barely observable (see Figure 3).
Figure 3 suggests that, for the present surface model, the effect of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic conﬁnement is to shift the maximum of F(T) to lower temperatures T < 220 K. The shift in temperature appears more pronounced in the hydrophobic case. Consistent with these observations, a shift of the density anomaly to lower temperatures has been reported in simulations using the TIP5P water model conﬁned between parallel, smooth, hydrophobic inﬁnite walls.58,59
From the slope of F(T) in Figure 3 we obtain the thermal expansion coefﬁcient, RP(T) ≡ -F(T)-1(∂F(T)/∂T)P. Figure 3 suggests that, compared to the bulk, RP(T) increases upon hydrophilic conﬁnement and is still larger in hydrophobic conﬁnement. The values of RP(T) at T ) 280 K obtained from Figure 3 are RP(T) ) 0.539, 1.14, and 2.93 × 10- 3 K- 1 for bulk, hydrophilically conﬁned, and hydrophobically conﬁned water, respectively. Our results are consistent with experiments and computer simulations for water conﬁned in silica nanopores, which also show an anomalously high RP(T)60-62 relative to the

13726 J. Phys. Chem. B, Vol. 113, No. 42, 2009
bulk. Computer simulations in ref 62 indicate that the high RP(T) of water conﬁned in silica pores is associated with the compression and structure of water within ≈0.6 nm of the silica surface.
In ref 43 (see Figure 7 in that work), it was observed that water is more compressible when conﬁned by hydrophobic surfaces than it is in hydrophilic conﬁnement. Similarly, Figure 3 implies that water is more expansible upon heating when conﬁned by hydrophobic, as opposed to hydrophilic, surfaces. Thus, the similarity in the behavior of interfacial water observed upon isobaric cooling and isothermal compression is reﬂected in the analogous behavior of the response functions (thermal expansion coefﬁcient and isothermal compressibility) associated with these processes.
B. Water Structure. In this section, we describe the structure of liquid water at the interface with the plates. We consider the case P ) -0.05 GPa and d ) 1.6 nm since at these conditions no crystal or vapor forms between the plates (Figure 2). To characterize water structure in the conﬁned volume, we follow the discussion of Section I.B of our previous work in ref 43. The same properties described in that section, studied there at T ) 300 K for different pressures, are presented here at P ) -0.05 GPa for different temperatures. This allows us to directly compare the effects of isothermal compression to those of isobaric cooling on the conﬁned water structure, one of the important goals of this work.
Figure 4a shows the density proﬁle F(z) of water at different temperatures. F(z) is the density in a slab parallel to the plates located at z; the slab area being equal to the plate area (in this work we use slabs of thickness 0.0411 nm). At T ) 300 K, F(z) is characterized by four maxima, indicating that there are four water layers between the plates. As temperature decreases, the extrema of F(z) become sharper, indicating an enhancement of water structure upon cooling. The increase in density in the layer immediately adjacent to each plate is striking. The maxima of F(z) corresponding to these water layers, at z ≈ ( 0.55 nm, increase by 30% from ≈1.0 g/cm3, at T ) 300 K, to ≈1.3 g/cm3, at T ) 240 K. Further cooling to T ) 220 K (corresponding approximately to the bulk ice Ih melting temperature of the SPC/E model at this pressure49) does not cause further increase of the density next to the plates. The peak of F(z) closest to each plate also broadens asymmetrically, in the direction toward the plate, upon cooling, indicating that water molecules move closer to the plates (see Figure 4a). These observations demonstrate that, as the temperature decreases, the plates become more “attractive” to water and, correspondingly, the effective hydrophobicity of the plates decreases. The weakening of the surface hydrophobicity is consistent with the unfolding of proteins upon cooling (cold denaturation) with the exposure of hydrophobic surface.12,63-65 Cold unfolding is believed to be driven by energetically favorable interactions between water and hydrophobic residues, coupled with the reduction at lower temperature of the entropic cost associated with water structuring near the (partially) unfolded protein.12
Next, we compare the changes of the density proﬁles along the following thermodynamic paths: (i) isobaric cooling at P ) -0.05 GPa (this work) and (ii) isothermal compression at T ) 300 K (ref 43). Figures 4a (this work) and 8a of ref 43 indicate that the two processes have very similar effects on the density proﬁle. In both cases, the ﬁrst peak of F(z) increases and becomes wider, approaching the plate. The changes in the ﬁrst peak of F(z) upon compression from P ) -0.05 GPa to P ) 0.2 GPa at T ) 300 K and upon cooling from T ) 300 K to T ) 220 K at P ) -0.05 GPa are quantitatiVely similar. For

Plates are hydrophobic and P ) -0.05 GPa. Arrows indicate the direction of decreasing temperatures. example, the height of this peak increases from ≈1.0 g/cm3 to ≈1.4 g/cm3 with the cited pressure change (Figure 8a of ref 43) and from ≈1.0 g/cm3 to ≈1.3 g/cm3 with the cited temperature reduction in Figure 4a. A subtle difference in F(z) does occur between thermodynamic paths i and ii. Upon isobaric compression at the present value of d, a weak (ﬁfth) water layer develops;43 while Figure 4a shows that there are four water layers at all temperatures upon isobaric cooling at P ) -0.05 GPa.
To further analyze water structure at the molecular level, we ﬁrst consider the coordination number. We calculate the average

oxygen coordination number, CN(z), around each water molecule located in slabs centered at positions z (we use slabs of thickness 0.0411 nm).66 The CN(z) proﬁles at P ) -0.05 GPa and different temperatures are shown in Figure 4b. Upon cooling, CN(z) increases, consistent with the increase of both F(z) (Figure 4a) and total conﬁned water density (Figure 3), as temperature decreases. As is the case with F(z), the changes in CN(z) upon isobaric cooling (Figure 4b) are quantitatiVely similar to those observed upon isothermal compression (Figure 8b of ref 43). For example, isobaric cooling at P ) -0.05 GPa (Figure 4b) results in an increment of CN(z ) 0) from ≈3.6, at T ) 300 K, to ≈3.9, at T ) 220 K. Isothermal compression at T ) 300 K (Figure 8b of ref 43) results in the same increment of CN(z ) 0) from ≈3.6, at P ) -0.05 GPa, to ≈3.9, at P ) 0.2 GPa. We note that Figures 4b (this work) and 8b (of ref 43) indicate similar changes in CN(z) along thermodynamic paths i and ii for all z, and not only in the region next to the surfaces.
In order to characterize the relative angular distribution of water molecules, we calculate the local tetrahedral order parameter q.67 For a given molecule, q quantiﬁes how close the arrangement of its four nearest-neighbors is to perfect tetrahedrality.68 For example in ice Ih, molecules are arranged in perfect tetrahedra and q reaches it maximum value q ) 1. For a set of noninteracting molecules whose nearest-neighbors are randomly oriented, the average value of q is 0.
Figure 4c shows q(z),43 the average local tetrahedral order parameter of molecules located in a slab centered at z. As temperature decreases, q(z) increases for all values of z, indicating that the water local structure becomes more ice-like in this respect. In addition, the central maximum of q(z) becomes wider, i.e., tetrahedral order increases in regions progressively closer to the plates with decreasing temperature. The values of q(z) in the central region of the conﬁned volume (z ≈ 0) are consistent with the values reported in bulk SPC/E water simulations at similar conditions. For example, Figure 4a shows that the density of water at z ≈ 0 is 0.9-1 g/cm3 for T ) 220-300 K. At these densities, the values of q in bulk SPC/E water67 are q ≈ 0.64, at T ) 300 K, and q ≈ 0.77, at T ) 220 K. These values are very close to the values of q(z ) 0) (Figure 4c), i.e., q(z ) 0) ≈ 0.64, at T ) 300 K, and q ≈ 0.78, at T ) 220 K. Thus, water approximately 0.8 nm away from the plates has a tetrahedral arrangement similar to that of bulk water at comparable thermodynamic conditions.
In distinct contrast to what we have seen for both the density and coordination number, a comparison of Figure 4c (this work) to Figure 8c (of ref 43) shows a different evolution of q(z) upon isobaric cooling and isothermal compression. Although isothermal compression does result in a wider q(z) proﬁle, the amplitude of q(z) remains practically constant along this path (Figure 8c of ref 43). Therefore, while the local coordination number and density evolve similarly upon isobaric cooling and isothermal compression, the degree of tetrahedrality q(z) is notably enhanced by cooling, while it is nearly unperturbed by compression.
In order to fully characterize the water structure at the interface, we have also calculated the oxygen (O) radial distribution function (RDF) relative to the oxygen atoms (O′) at the surface gOO′(r). Figure 5 shows gOO′(r) at P ) -0.05 GPa and different temperatures. This ﬁgure can be compared with Figure 10 (of ref 43) that shows the effect of compression at T ) 300 K on gOO′(r). Once again, the similarities between these ﬁgures show analogous behavior of interfacial water upon isobaric cooling and isothermal compression. The ﬁrst maximum

of gOO′(r) (located at r ≈ 0.27 nm) increases from ≈1.25 up to ≈2.4 in Figure 10 (of ref 43) and from ≈1.25 up to ≈2.0 in Figure 5. As discussed in detail in refs 43 and 69-71, water molecules in the ﬁrst layer next to the plates arrange in hexagonal structures that are templated by the surfaces.
C. Water Contact Angle, Surface Hydrophobicity, and Water Orientation at the Interface. A macroscopic property that quantiﬁes the hydrophobicity of a surface is its water contact angle. By deﬁnition, hydrophobic surfaces have a contact angle larger than 90°. The concept of contact angle can be extended to nanoscale systems. Water droplets consisting of O(103) molecules in contact with surfaces can be simulated.72-76 The results from the previous section and, in particular, the suppression of the vapor-phase region at low temperature (Figure 2) indicate that the effective hydrophobicity of the model surface decreases upon cooling. Therefore, one would expect that the contact angle of the present surface model would also decrease upon cooling. Furthermore, since for the present surface model water’s contact angle is in one-to-one correspondence with water’s molecular orientational distribution at the interface,74 one would also expect the molecular orientation to be a function of temperature. In this section, we study the evolution of both water contact angle and molecular orientation at the interface upon isobaric cooling (P ) -0.05 GPa) and show that, contrary to expectations, these properties show a very weak change upon cooling.
To allow a calculation of the contact angle, we consider a water droplet in contact with an “inﬁnite”77 hydrophobic surface. The surface differs from the ﬁnite plates considered above only in extent and has the same composition and structure. The simulation details and the procedure used to calculate the average drop proﬁle are given in ref 74. Figure 6 shows the average drop proﬁles obtained from 5.6-5.8 ns simulations performed at different temperatures. Only data for t g 3 ns are used in the calculations. The drop proﬁles are, for all practical purposes, overlapping at all temperatures. From these proﬁles, we obtain the contact angles74 θc ) 105, 107, 105, 105, and 101° for T ) 300, 280, 260, 240, and 220 K, respectively. The insensitivity of θc to changes in temperature indicates that the (nanoscale) water contact angle does not provide a satisfactory measure of the surface hydrophobicity.
To characterize the orientation of water molecules at the interface, we follow refs 74 and 78 and deﬁne four hydrogen bond (HB) Vectors for each water molecule. These vectors point to the corners of an imaginary tetrahedron centered at the oxygen atom of the given molecule. The tetrahedron is oriented such that two of the HB vectors point along the directions deﬁned by the molecule’s OH covalent bonds (HB-OH vectors); the

remaining two HB vectors (HB-Oe vectors) point along the directions associated with the molecule’s hypothetical lone-pair electrons. We deﬁne θhb as the angle formed by any of the molecule’s HB vectors, and the unit vector normal to the surface and pointing into the conﬁned liquid volume nˇ. Similarly, the angles θhb-OH and θhb-Oe are deﬁned as the angles formed by nˇ and the HB-OH and HB-Oe vectors, respectively.
Figure 7a-c shows the probability distributions P(θhb), P(θhb-OH), and P(θhb-Oe) calculated for molecules within a distance e0.2 nm from either of the conﬁning surfaces. Figure 7a shows P(θhb) at P ) -0.05 GPa for different temperatures. P(θhb) has a local maximum at θhb ≈ 70° and also increases as θhbf180°. As discussed in refs 43, 74, and 78, this indicates that water molecules next to the surface have, on average, one HB vector pointing into the surface and the remaining HB vectors forming an angle of ≈70° with nˇ. A scheme showing a molecule with this average molecular orientation next to the surface is indicated in Figure 7d. Figure 7b and c shows that both P(θhb-Oe) and P(θhb-OH) have a maximum at ≈70°. However, only P(θhb-OH) increases sharply as θhb-OHf180°. Therefore, the HB vector pointing into the wall in Figure 7d is mainly a HB-OH vector.74 This picture is consistent with the calculation of the angle θµ formed between nˇ and interfacial water molecule’s dipole moment, bµ. The distribution for θµ shows a wide single maximum centered at θµ ≈ 120°. As discussed in ref 74, the extreme asymmetric behavior of water molecule orientation at the interface is a manifestation of the asymmetry of the water potential, which is much less directional along the HB-Oe than HB-OH vectors.
The angle distributions in Figure 7 change weakly upon cooling. The extrema of these distributions become sharper as the temperature decreases. In particular, P(θhb-Oe) and P(θhb-OH) increase at ≈180° upon cooling. This indicates that the scheme in Figure 7d becomes a progressively more representative depiction of the molecules at the interface as the temperature decreases. A comparison of Figure 7a with Figure 9 (of ref 43) shows that the changes observed in Figure 7a upon isobaric cooling are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in ref 43 (see Figure 9 in that work) upon isothermal compression.
In summary, for the hydrophobic plates, water’s (nanoscale) contact angle is practically constant, and the interfacial orientation of water molecules changes only slightly upon isobaric cooling. In contrast, the changes in F(z) (Figure 4) and in the phase behavior (Figure 2), which point toward a decrease of surface hydrophobicity upon cooling, are large. Therefore, for the present surface model, neither water contact angle nor molecular orientation at the interface can be used to capture

Giovambattista et al.
the T dependence of surface hydrophobicity, as it is reﬂected in local water density or the propensity for water cavitation. Correspondingly, we ﬁnd that the nanoscale wettability of such a conﬁned surface, implicated in protein denaturation via pressure,79 cannot be simply understood using measured nanoscale contact angles and the macroscopic relationship to interfacial tension.
IV. Results: Hydrophilic Plates
For the hydrophilic plates case, we perform simulations over the temperature range 220 e T e 300 K, and we ﬁx d ) 1.6 nm and P ) -0.05 GPa. At these conditions, conﬁned water remains in the liquid phase with no sign of crystallization. Simulations of water conﬁned between the present hydrophilic surfaces at T ) 300 K indicate that water remains in the liquid phase, even at the thermodynamic conditions where bulk water cavitates.43 Figure 3 shows that the density of water conﬁned between hydrophilic plates increases upon isobaric cooling. Therefore, isobaric cooling suppresses the vapor phase formation, further stabilizing the liquid phase. As was pointed out in Section III.A, hydrophilic conﬁnement suppresses the density anomaly and causes a modest increase of water’s thermal expansion coefﬁcient.
A. Water Structure. In this section we discuss brieﬂy the effects of isobaric cooling on the structural properties of water conﬁned between hydrophilic plates. The corresponding F(z), CN(z), and q(z) proﬁles are shown in Figure 8; this ﬁgure is the hydrophilic counterpart of Figure 4.
Figure 8a shows F(z) at different temperatures. F(z) exhibits two large peaks next to each surface, indicating the presence of two water layers next to the plates. The peaks of F(z) do not shift location, and their magnitude increases slightly upon cooling. The effects of cooling on F(z) are noticeably weaker than those observed in Figure 4 for the hydrophobic case. For example, the ﬁrst peaks of F(z) in Figure 8a increase from ≈1.6 to ≈1.8 g/cm3 (≈12.5%), while in Figure 4a they increase from ≈1.0 to ≈1.3 g/cm3 (≈30.0%). Small oscillations in F(z) are present for -0.3 e z e 0.3 nm, indicating that water is weakly structured in the cental region.
The CN(z) proﬁle (Figure 8b) is mainly constant across the conﬁned volume, i.e., water molecules next to the surface have the same number of neighboring oxygen atoms as those located at the central region between the plates.68 For molecules next to the plates, some of the neighboring oxygen atoms are provided by surface silanol groups, which are included in CN. As temperature decreases, CN(z) increases uniformly from ≈3.4, at T ≈ 300 K, to ≈ 3.8, at T ) 220 K. This increment of 0.4 is the same as that found in the hydrophobic case (Figure 4b). This is in agreement with the view that the increment in CN is inherent to the cooling process and not due to the conﬁnement.
Figure 8c shows q(z) at different temperatures. As in the case of CN(z), the q(z) proﬁle is mainly ﬂat at T ) 300 K; water molecules next to the surface silanol groups have an environment similar to that of water molecules far from the plates, surrounded by other water molecules.68 As temperature decreases, q(z) increases uniformly for |z| < 0.6 nm. The increment of q(z) is much smaller very close to the surface (|z| > 0.6 nm); the smaller average tetrahedrality in this region being due to the presence of the plate silanol groups. q(z ≈ 0) increases from ≈0.58, at T ) 300 K, to ≈0.75, at T ) 220 K.
Next, we compare the evolution of F(z), CN(z), and q(z) upon isobaric cooling (Figure 8) and isothermal compression (Figure 12 of ref 43). As found in the hydrophobic conﬁnement case, we ﬁnd quantitatiVely similar changes in both F(z) and CN(z) proﬁles upon

cooling, from 300 down to 220 K at P ) -0.05 GPa, and upon compression, from -0.05 to 0.2 GPa at T ) 300 K. For example, the height of the ﬁrst peak of F(z) is ≈1.6 g/cm3 at T ) 300 K and P ) -0.05 GPa. It increases to 1.85 g/cm3 upon isobaric cooling to T ) 220 K (P ) -0.05 GPa) and to ≈1.90 g/cm3 upon isothermal compression to T ) 300 K (P ) 0.2 GPa). Along both thermodynamic paths, CN(z ) 0) increases from ≈3.5 up to 4.0.80
When comparing the effect of compression and cooling on q(z), the situation is, once again, similar to the hydrophobic case; the two paths give very different responses for q(z). While q(z) does not change upon isothermal compression (Figure 12c of ref 43), isobaric cooling results in an increase of tetrahedrality (Figure 8c). This is not surprising, since water becomes more ice-like upon cooling, but not upon compression.
In order to characterize water structure at the interface, we calculate the water oxygen RDF relative to the surface hydrogenbonding silanol oxygen (O′) and hydrogen (H′) atoms gO′O(r) and gH′O(r), respectively. gO′O(r) and gH′O(r) are shown in Figure 9. The location of the extrema of both RDFs does not shift upon cooling, although these peaks do become slightly sharper. The same sharpening of the surface RDFs occurs in the hydrophobic case (Figure 5), although the changes in that case are much larger, in correspondence with the large changes observed in F(z).
Summarizing, the effects of isobaric cooling on the coordination number and tetrahedrality proﬁles are qualitatively similar in hydrophobic vs hydrophilic conﬁnement (Figures 4b vs 8b and 4c vs 8c). The density proﬁles, on the other hand, are appreciably more sensitive to cooling in hydrophobic than in hydrophilic conﬁnement (Figures 4a vs 8a and 5 vs 9a). Isobaric cooling (300 g T g 220 K at P ) -0.05 GPa) and isothermal compression (-0.05 e P e 0.2 GPa at T ) 300 K; ref 43) produce quantitatively similar changes in the density and coordination number proﬁles under hydrophobic and hydrophilic conﬁnement [Figures 4a (this work) vs 8a (ref 43), and 8a (this

work) vs 12a (ref 43); 44b (this work) vs 8b (ref 43) and 8b (this work) vs 12b (ref 43)].
B. Water Orientation at the Interface. The angle distributions P(θhb), P(θhb-OH), and P(θhb-Oe) for water conﬁned between hydrophilic plates are shown in Figure 10a-c. P(θhb) (Figure 10a) has a peak at θhb ≈ 110° and increases as θhbf0°. As explained in refs 43, 74, and 81, these characteristics in the angle distributions follow from the fact that a water molecule next to the plate has, on average, one HB vector pointing into the conﬁned volume, perpendicular to the surface (see Figure 10d). The remaining three HB vectors point toward the surface (forming an angle of ≈110° with nˇ) and participate in hydrogen bonds with the surface. Comparison of Figure 10b and c shows that most of the time HB-Oe vectors are parallel to nˇ (i.e., θhb-Oe ≈ 0°). Instead, HB-OH vectors point preferentially toward the surface, forming an angle of θhb-OH ≈ 110° with nˇ. Therefore, the HB vector in Figure 10d that points away from the plate is a HB-Oe vector. Inspection of water dipole moment orientation at the interface (not shown) supports the scheme shown in Figure 10d. The distribution of the angle θµ, formed between water molecule dipole moments and nˇ, is bimodal with maxima at θµ ≈ 60 and 120°. However, the maximum at θµ ≈ 120° is much larger than the maximum at θµ ≈ 60°, indicating that water dipole moment points, on average, toward the surface (θµ ≈ 120°). For the present hydrophilic surfaces, the asymmetric role played by the HB-OH and HB-Oe vectors of water molecules at the interface is induced by the presence of surface silanol groups, which have more H-acceptor than H-donor sites.
The main result of Figure 10 is the weak dependence of the angle distributions on temperature. A comparison of Figures 7 and 10 shows that the changes in these distributions are of the same order of magnitude in the hydrophobic and hydrophilic case. In ref 43, we showed that angle distributions, for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic conﬁnement, are also practically invariant under isothermal compression (Figures 9 and 13 in

Figure 8. F(z), CN(z), and q(z) as in Figure 4 but for the case of hydrophilic plates. Arrows indicate the direction of decreasing temperatures. ref 43). Therefore, the orientation of water molecules at the interface, for the present model, is largely a function of the surface polarity74 and is very weakly dependent on temperature and pressure. V. Results: Heterogeneous Plates
In the previous sections, we studied the effect of temperature on water conﬁned between hydrophobic and hydrophilic homogeneous surfaces. However, in practical cases, conﬁning surfaces are expected to be chemically heterogeneous, showing patches of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. In this section,

Giovambattista et al.

we study the effects of temperature on water conﬁned between heterogeneous plates, focusing on the local density next to the plates. We ﬁnd a local response corresponding to that observed for the relevant type of homogeneous surface. That is, cooling results in an increase of water density next to the hydrophobic regions of the heterogeneous plates; in contrast, water density next to the hydrophilic regions remains practically constant upon cooling. At T ) 220 K and P ) -0.05 GPa, the resulting differences in the local solvent density adjacent to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of the heterogeneous plates are quite small. The changes in water density upon isobaric cooling are also found to be remarkably similar to those observed upon isothermal compression.43
We consider plates separated by a distance d ) 1.6 nm at P ) -0.05 GPa and analyze water local density next to the plates. We follow ref 44 and calculate the density contour map, nw(x,y). Brieﬂy, we divide the plate surface into Nx × Ny ) 13 × 15 computational cells of area 0.247 × 0.214 nm2. For each cell i, we calculate the time-averaged number of molecules in the cell, Nw,i (i ) 1,..., 195); only molecules within a distance 0.266 nm from the surface are considered in the statistics. To obtain a continuous density contour map from the set {Nw,i}, we deﬁne

Nx×Ny

∑ nw(x, y) ≡ C

Nw,i exp(-(x - xi)2/2σx2) ×

i)1

exp(-(y - yi)2/2σy2) (1)

In eq 1, (xi,yi) are the coordinates of the center of computational cell i. σx and σy are constants given in ref 44. Hence, nw(xi,yi) is proportional to the average local water density at point (xi,yi) within a slab of thickness 0.266 nm next to the plates. We set C ) 1, and present un-normalized density distributions graphically to illustrate water spatial distributions in the form of contour plots.
We discuss ﬁrst the reference case of homogeneous plates. Figure 11 shows nw(x,y) for water conﬁned between hydrophilic (left column) and hydrophobic (right column) plates for temperatures 220 e T e 280 K. The corresponding cases at T ) 300 K are shown in Figure 2 of ref 44. At T ) 280 K, the interfacial surface density map for water close to hydrophobic plates (upper right panel of Figure 11) indicates that the surface is virtually dry. As the temperature decreases (top to bottom panels in the right-hand column of Figure 11), the contour map color shifts, indicating that water molecules approach the surface and that the average total number of water molecules Nw(T) next to the surface increases82 (see Table 1) from 69 at T ) 300 K to 128 at T ) 220 K. The corresponding surface density values are nw ) 6.7 and 12.4 molecules/nm2, which represents an increase of 85.5% in interfacial water density. This increase in nw(T) upon cooling is consistent with the shift of the ﬁrst peak of F(z) toward the surface (top panel of Figure 4). In the hydrophilic conﬁnement case, the average interfacial water density is practically constant nw ) 14.8 molecules/nm2 (see Table 1 and Figure 11, left-hand column).
Figure 12 shows the effect of temperature on the interfacial water densities next to heterogeneous surfaces. We consider two surfaces characterized by (a) a hydrophilic patch surrounded by a hydrophobic border (Figure 12a) and (b) a hydrophobic patch surrounded by a hydrophilic border (Figure 12b). The patch and border area are 4.296 and 6.039 nm2, respectively (see also ref 44). Figures 12c and e show nw(x,y) for the hydrophilic-patch plate at T ) 300 K and T ) 220 K, respectively. The corresponding contour maps for the hydrophobic-patch plate are shown in Figure 12d and f, respectively.

In all cases, P ) -0.05 GPa. Figure 12c-f clearly shows the manner in which isobaric cooling blurs the difference between interfacial water densities next to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of both heterogeneous surfaces. While at T ) 300 K, the density contour map clearly resembles the hydrophilicity pattern of the surface, only weak traces of the surface pattern can be identiﬁed at T ) 220 K.
Table 2 gives the time-averaged number of interfacial water molecules next to heterogeneous plates and the corresponding surface densities. Comparison with Table 1 allows an assessment of the effects of heterogeneity on interfacial water density, and the manner in which it is affected by temperature. The presence of a hydrophilic border induces wetting of a hydrophobic patch: at T ) 300 K, the water density on the hydrophobic patch is 10.5 molecules/nm2, whereas the interfacial density on the same area of the homogeneous hydrophobic plate is 6.3 molecules/ nm2. This remarkable weakening of nanoscale hydrophobicity due to chemical patchiness was ﬁrst reported in ref 44. An analogous effect can be seen upon comparing water density on the hydrophobic border of the hydrophilic patch plate (8.8 molecules/nm2) and on the corresponding area of the homoge-

neous hydrophobic plate (6.9 molecules/nm2). The converse effect is absent: water density on a hydrophilic patch surrounded by a hydrophobic border (15.4 molecules/nm2) is very similar to the density on the corresponding region of a homogeneous hydrophilic plate (15.8 molecules/nm2).
Water surface density on a hydrophobic substrate, whether this be a chemically homogeneous hydrophobic surface or a hydrophobic patch on a chemically heterogeneous surface, increases markedly upon cooling, whereas it is quite insensitive to temperature near hydrophilic substrates (see Tables 1 and 2). Accordingly, cooling causes a progressive blurring of differences between interfacial water densities manifested at hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Analogous behavior upon isothermal compression was reported in ref 44 [see, e.g., Figure 6 of that work and Figure 11 (this work)].

tions. Hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and heterogeneous surfaces (i.e., surfaces with hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches) were considered. Comparison of the present isobaric cooling simulations with our previous investigation of isothermal compression,43 using identical systems and simulation technique, is especially valuable in the context of nanoscale conﬁnement studies, in light of the extreme sensitivity of conﬁned phase behavior to very subtle changes in the nature of the surfaces (e.g., ref 83) or the strength of their interactions with water (e.g., ref 46). An important motivation behind this work and ref 43 is the important role of conﬁned and interfacial water in biology.11,84 We note that the thermodynamic paths investigated

Giovambattista et al.
here and in ref 43 correspond to those followed in the processes of cold- and pressure-induced protein denaturation, respectively.
A key observation from this work is that lowering the temperature reduces the effective hydrophobicity of nanoscale domains. This is consistent with the increase in the solubility of hydrophobic solutes in water upon cooling (e.g., refs 85 and 86). At T ) 220 K and P ) -0.05 GPa, close to the bulk crystallization temperature of the water model, the local water densities next to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains become very similar. It is striking that quantitatively similar effects on interfacial water density next to chemically identical plates are observed when the system is compressed to ≈0.2 GPa at T ) 300 K.43 The decrease in hydrophobicity upon isobaric cooling and isothermal compression is entirely consistent with the wellknown cold- and pressure-induced protein denaturation processes (see Figure 1) and suggests that the penetration by water of hydrophobic cavities is an important mechanism involved in both these phenomena.
The weakening of hydrophobicity upon cooling has important consequences for conﬁned water thermodynamics. We calculated the P-d phase diagram of water conﬁned by hydrophobic plates at T ) 300 and 220 K. At 300 K, the phase diagram includes crystal (bilayer ice), liquid, and vapor regions. At T ) 220 K, when the walls are more “attractive” to water, the vaporphase region practically disappears, while the crystal- and liquidphase regions increase correspondingly.
A macroscopic quantity commonly used to measure the hydrophobicity of a surface is its water contact angle, θc. Water contact angles have been measured in simulations using nanodroplets composed of O(1000) molecules. We ﬁnd that θc is insensitive to temperature between 220 and 300 K. This result contrasts with the weakening of hydrophobicity inferred from the calculated interfacial density and phase behavior of conﬁned water. The insensitivity of θc to changes in temperature indicates that this quantity, at least at the nanoscale, may not provide an adequate quantiﬁcation of the surface hydrophobicity.
We studied the effect of temperature on the thermal expansion of water conﬁned between hydrophobic and hydrophilic plates at constant pressure and “large” separations (d ) 1.6 nm). At these conditions, conﬁned water is found only in the liquid state. We ﬁnd that in both cases, water density increases upon cooling. At the pressure considered here P ) -0.05 GPa, bulk SPC/E water shows a density anomaly. However, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic conﬁnement shift the density anomaly to lower temperature. Even at the lowest temperature simulated (T ) 220 K), no density anomaly is observed under conﬁnement. From the density calculations we also obtained the thermal expansion coefﬁcient, RP(T). RP(T) is smallest in the bulk, increases upon hydrophilic conﬁnement, and is larger upon hydrophobic conﬁnement.
We also studied the structural properties of the conﬁned liquid. We calculated the density, coordination number, and tetrahedral order parameter. The effect of isobaric cooling in both hydrophobic and hydrophilic conﬁnement is remarkably similar to that reported in ref 43 under isothermal compression. In hydrophobic conﬁnement, water density increases throughout the conﬁned space upon cooling and molecules also move toward the surface. This is indicative of a weakening of hydrophobicity as T decreases. Under hydrophilic conﬁnement, water density increases throughout the conﬁned space. However, no increase in local density next to the surface occurs: the hydrophilicity of the surface is practically insensitive to temperature. The tetrahedrality proﬁle shows an increase in order upon cooling for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic conﬁnement.

The orientation of water molecules at the interface is very different next to hydrophobic and hydrophilic plates. Next to hydrophobic plates, molecules have one H atom preferentially pointing perpendicularly toward the plate (Figure 7d). Instead, molecules next to hydrophilic plates have one hydrogen bond direction, corresponding predominantly to a lone-electron pair, pointing perpendicularly away from the plate. Interestingly, in both cases, the orientation of the molecules is largely insensitive to changes in temperature. In ref 74, we observed that water molecular orientation at the interface is also P independent. These results indicate that the molecular orientation at the interface is mainly determined by the plate surface polarity (chemistry)74 and not by the thermodynamic conditions.
We also studied the effect of heterogeneity on the interfacial water density. We considered plates consisting of a hydrophobic (hydrophilic) patch surrounded by a hydrophilic (hydrophobic) border. Simulations show that, for the present model surfaces,

the local density next to hydrophobic regions is enhanced by neighboring hydrophilic domains (see ref 44). Since hydrophobic surfaces become more “attractive” to water upon cooling, this hydrophilicity-induced wetting of hydrophobic regions is less pronounced as T decreases.
In light of the demonstrated sensitivity of interfacial water properties to details of the conﬁning surface’s chemistry (e.g., refs 83 and 87), it would be interesting to perform studies similar to ours, and in particular comparisons along different paths, for water conﬁned by, e.g., biological or amorphous solid surfaces characterized by realistic heterogeneous chemistry.

(57) For a better comparison with our results, the values of P taken from refs 54 and 56 have been corrected so Lennard-Jones corrections are eliminated (see footnote 86 in ref. 57). Therefore, the data shown in Figure 3 for the bulk case correspond to data at P ) -0.1 GPa in refs 54 and 56 Our conclusions hold even if one considers the bulk densities at P ) -0 GPa from these works.

(66) We deﬁne the coordination number of a given water molecule as the number of neighboring oxygen atoms within a distance 0.32 nm from the molecule’s oxygen atom. The neighboring oxygen atoms can belong to neighboring water molecules or to the plates. (67) Errington, J. R.; Debenedetti, P. G. Nature 2001, 409, 318. (68) In both hydrophobic and hydrophilic cases, molecules adjacent to the plates can have oxygen nearest-neighbors belonging to the surface. These surface oxygen atoms are also included in the calculations of water molecule tetrahedral order (q) and coordination number (CN).

(77) To calculate the contact angle of the hydrophobic surface, we use a cubic system with sides of length L ) 13.86 nm. A square wall of dimenesions L × L is located on one side of the system box, parallel to the x-y plane. The atomic-scale wall structure is the same as the hydrophobic plates used in Section III. We use periodic boundary conditions along the x and y axes. Therefore, the wall is effectively “inﬁnite” along these directions. (78) Lee, C. Y.; McCammon, J. A.; Rossky, P. J. J. Chem.

(80) We note that the there is a mistake in the labels of Figure 12b of ref 43. In that ﬁgure, the labels P ) -0.05 GPa and P ) 0.2 GPa should be exchanged. (81) Lee, C. Y.; Rossky, P. J. J. Chem. Phys. 1994, 100, 3334. (82) We note that in all panels of Figures 11 and 12 there are ﬁxed blue regions periodically distributed over the contour map. The underlying structure of the plates (β-cristobalite) is characterized by SiO4 tetrahedra that alternate, pointing into and out from the surface. As explained in ref 44, the blue regions in the contour map correspond to the location of SiO4 tetrahedra that point into the conﬁned volume. (83) Hua, L.; Huang, X.; Liu, P.; Zhou, R.; Berne, B. J.
