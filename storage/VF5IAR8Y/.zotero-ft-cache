Abstract

Cells respond to stress by blocking translation, rewiring metabolism and forming transient messenger ribonucleoprotein assemblies called stress granules (SGs). After stress release, re-establishing homeostasis and disassembling SGs requires ATP-consuming processes. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby cells restore ATP production and disassemble SGs after stress remain poorly understood. Here we show that upon stress, the ATP-producing enzyme Cdc19 forms inactive amyloids, and that their rapid re-solubilization is essential to restore ATP production and disassemble SGs in glucose-containing media. Cdc19 re-solubilization is initiated by the glycolytic metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which directly binds Cdc19 amyloids, allowing Hsp104 and Ssa2 chaperone recruitment and aggregate re-solubilization. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate then promotes Cdc19 tetramerization, which boosts its activity to further enhance ATP production and SG disassembly. Together, these results describe a molecular mechanism that is critical for stress recovery and directly couples cellular metabolism with SG dynamics via the regulation of reversible Cdc19 amyloids.

Main

To maintain homeostasis, cells need to rapidly sense stress conditions, such as heat stress and nutrient starvation, and orchestrate the appropriate protective responses, including the formation of stress granules (SGs) 1 . Stress granules are reversible, membrane-less messenger ribonucleoprotein organelles that form in the cytoplasm in response to metabolic stress and are thought to store and protect messenger RNA and proteins from stress-induced degradation 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . The formation of persistent SGs due to chronic stress or mutations and the consequent metabolic changes have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease 7 , 8 . Thus, SGs must be tightly controlled and efficiently disassembled. However, despite their patho-physiological importance, the mechanisms regulating SG dynamics remain poorly understood.

Most SG proteins contain intrinsically disordered low-complexity regions (LCRs) that can condense by liquid-liquid phase separation 9 , 10 . This process, together with low-affinity RNA–RNA interactions, is thought to underlie SG formation 11 , 12 . In contrast, SG disassembly mechanisms are less well understood. ATP plays a crucial role in disassembly, as artificial ATP depletion reduces SG dynamics and results in persistent SGs 3 , 9 , 13 , whereas the addition of ATP to stressed cells triggers aggregate disassembly 14 . The ATP-dependent activities of the disaggregase Hsp104 and the Hsp70 chaperones Ssa1 and Ssa2 as well as the kinases Sky1 (ref. 15 ) and ULK1/2 (ref. 16 ) have been implicated in efficient SG disassembly and growth restart after stress 14 , 17 . ATP itself was also proposed to act as a biological hydrotrope, modulating cytoplasmic diffusion and further facilitating aggregate re-solubilization 18 . However, ATP reserves are rapidly depleted in stressed cells 14 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , raising the question of how energy production is restored for efficient post-stress SG disassembly.

Yeast cells mainly produce ATP by fermenting glucose through glycolysis 23 , 24 , in which the conserved enzyme pyruvate kinase (Cdc19) catalyses the ATP-producing and irreversible final step—that is the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP into pyruvate and ATP. Cdc19 activity is modulated by its allosteric regulator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which promotes Cdc19 oligomerization into more active tetramers 4 , 22 , 25 , 26 . Moreover, glycolytic flux is altered by trehalose metabolism, which regulates glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) availability and hexokinase activity 27 , 28 , 29 . We previously demonstrated that Cdc19 reversibly aggregates via its LCR and localizes to SGs in response to glucose starvation and heat stress 4 , 30 . The formation and disassembly of Cdc19 aggregates modulate SG dynamics and ensure stress survival. In particular, failure to timely re-solubilize Cdc19 aggregates results in persistent SGs and no cell-cycle restart after stress release. However, how physiological Cdc19 aggregates are re-solubilized and how they regulate SG disassembly is unclear.

To address these questions, we combined in vitro and in vivo approaches and exploited a Cdc19 mutant (Cdc19 irrev ) that is unable to disassemble Cdc19 aggregates after stress 4 . We found that reversible Cdc19 aggregates assume an enzymatically inactive amyloid structure in vivo. Their post-stress re-solubilization is necessary to restore ATP production and re-solubilize SGs on fermentable carbon sources. We propose a molecular mechanism in which direct FBP binding to functional Cdc19 aggregates initiates their re-solubilization and subsequent SG disassembly by promoting the recruitment of the molecular chaperones Hsp104 and Ssa2. Together, our results not only provide a mechanism for re-solubilizing functional amyloids in vivo but also show how metabolism and energy production are coupled to SG dynamics and cell growth.

SG disassembly depends on the re-solubilization of Cdc19 amyloids

The formation of reversible Cdc19 aggregates following stress and their timely re-solubilization after stress release is required to ensure cell survival 4 . Cells expressing an irreversibly aggregating mutant of Cdc19 (Cdc19 irrev ) are unable to restart growth after stress. This Cdc19 irrev mutant, called Cdc19 4D in previous work, bears four phosphomimicking mutations in the aggregation-prone Cdc19 LCR ( cdc19-T372D , T376D , S377D and S385D ; Extended Data Fig. 1a ). The Cdc19 irrev protein is active and cdc19 irrev cells grow similarly to the wild-type in conditions without stress. However following stress, Cdc19 irrev forms irreversible aggregates and causes persistent SGs (Fig. 1a, b ).

To understand how Cdc19 regulates SG disassembly and the mechanisms underlying Cdc19 aggregate re-solubilization, we investigated the properties of wild-type (Cdc19 WT ) and Cdc19 irrev aggregates as well as potential differences in vitro and in vivo. We examined biophysical characteristics of Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev aggregates to understand whether irreversibility was caused by an aberrant aggregate structure. Recombinant Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev proteins were produced from Escherichia coli and their aggregation was triggered in vitro by heat shock. Both proteins formed needle-like filaments, which were indistinguishable in negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig. 1c,d ). Also in circular dichroism spectroscopy, the wild-type and mutant aggregates revealed similar β-sheet-rich structures (Fig. 1e,f ), and both aggregates bound the amyloid dyes Thioflavin T and Congo red 31 (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c ), suggesting that Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev form similar amyloids in vitro. To test whether the Cdc19 aggregates also exhibit amyloid structures in vivo, we heat shocked and lysed yeast cells and stained both Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev aggregates with Congo red. Both cellular Cdc19 aggregates bound the amyloid dye (Extended Data Fig. 1d ). Background staining by Congo red is probably due to its ability to also bind cellular structures other than amyloids (for example, cell wall) 32 . To further confirm the amyloid nature of Cdc19 aggregates in vivo, we applied limited proteolysis (LiP) coupled to mass spectrometry (LiP-MS; Extended Data Fig. 1e ). This technique allows probing of subtle conformational changes both in vitro and in complex cell lysates and offers more precise structural information compared with conventional methods for detecting amyloids 33 , 34 . Cdc19 aggregation was induced in vitro by heat shocking purified Cdc19 and in vivo by subjecting cells to starvation stress to achieve full Cdc19 aggregation. The LiP-MS analysis revealed that diagnostic Cdc19 LiP-MS peptides characteristic of the amyloid conformation in vitro resemble the structures observed in vivo. Moreover, conformation-sensitive LiP peptides were mostly similar in the Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev assemblies, suggesting that their different re-solubilization behaviour is not due to radically different structures (Extended Data Fig. 1e ). Interestingly, LiP-MS also identified subtle structural alterations in the aggregated catalytic domain of Cdc19. Thus, Cdc19 aggregation and re-solubilization could affect Cdc19 activity and constitute a potential difference between Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev .
Cdc19 amyloid re-solubilization is crucial for ATP production

The comparison of the enzymatic activity of soluble and aggregated Cdc19 using an established lactate dehydrogenase-coupled pyruvate kinase activity assay revealed that Cdc19 amyloids are enzymatically inactive (Fig. 2a ). Given the large conformational changes required for amyloid fibril formation, the loss of catalytic activity is not surprising. In agreement with this, the cellular energy levels—represented by the ATP/ADP ratio—rapidly dropped in cells exposed to heat stress or glucose starvation, whereas the Cdc19 substrate PEP accumulated under these conditions 14 , 20 , 21 , 22 (Fig. 2c ). Thus, Cdc19 amyloids need to be re-solubilized to reactivate Cdc19 and resume energy production. Given that ATP is essential to disassemble SGs, persistent SGs in cdc19 irrev cells could be due to impaired ATP production. In contrast to wild-type controls, cdc19 irrev cells could not metabolise the accumulated PEP and hence failed to restore high ATP levels during stress recovery (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 1f ). We conclude that wild-type and cdc19 irrev cells differ primarily in their ability to restore energy production after stress.

During stress, Cdc19 (represented in green) forms inactive aggregates, which co-localize with SGs. Energy levels (ATP/ADP ratio) rapidly decrease under these conditions, whereas PEP accumulates. Following stress release, Cdc19 re-solubilizes, is reactivated and consumes PEP to produce ATP, concomitant with SG disassembly. d , Serial dilutions of exponentially growing cells of the indicated genotype were spotted on agar plates before and after heat shock at 42 °C for 30 min and imaged after 3 d at 30 °C ( n  = 3 independent experiments). e , f , ATP production using Cdc19-independent pathways allows Cdc19 irrev aggregate and SG re-solubilization after stress release.

To test whether an increase in ATP levels was sufficient to disassemble SGs, we restored ATP metabolism in heat-stressed cdc19 irrev cells by two Cdc19-independent means. First, we artificially overexpressed Pyk2, a pyruvate kinase isoform expressed at low levels in glucose-rich conditions that like Cdc19 uses PEP to produce ATP 35 . Consistent with our hypothesis, Pyk2 overexpression re-solubilized Cdc19 irrev aggregates and SGs, and restored growth of heat-shocked cdc19 irrev cells (Fig. 2d,e ). Second, we cultured cdc19 irrev cells with 2% ethanol instead of glucose. Under these conditions, ATP production occurs mainly via oxidative phosphorylation 36 . This also allowed Cdc19 irrev aggregate and SG re-solubilization (Fig. 2f ). We conclude that under physiological conditions, when yeast cells undergo fermentative growth, re-solubilizing Cdc19 amyloids is critical to resume post-stress ATP production, which is probably required to power ATP-dependent processes critical for SG dissolution and growth restart.
Disassembly of Cdc19 amyloids in vivo is triggered by FBP

To better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating Cdc19 amyloid disassembly, we isolated rare spontaneous suppressors that restore growth of stressed cdc19 irrev cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a ). After deleting PYK2 in the isolated mutants to exclude suppression by upregulated Pyk2 activity, we backcrossed them to wild-type cells to confirm Mendelian segregation of the phenotype. Using whole genome sequencing, we identified a single point mutation in trehalose synthase 3 (Tps3; tps3-G386D ), a protein involved in trehalose biosynthesis, as the probable cause for the Cdc19 irrev suppressor phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c ). Trehalose is a disaccharide synthesized in a two-step process (Fig. 3a ). Tps1 catalyses the conversion of G6P into trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), and Tps2 then converts T6P into trehalose. Tps3 acts as cofactor, facilitating trehalose production. Deletion of TPS1 , TPS2 or TPS3 to compromise trehalose synthesis (Extended Data Fig. 2e ; ref. 37 ) did not alter growth compared with the wild-type (Extended Data Fig. 2d ) but allowed cdc19 irrev cells to partially restore growth after stress release (Fig. 3b ), suggesting that decreased trehalose metabolism favours Cdc19 re-solubilization. As Tps1 catalyses the first reaction in trehalose synthesis and TPS1 deletion resulted in the strongest rescue (Fig. 3b ), we focussed on this mutant. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that growth restart correlated with Cdc19 irrev amyloid re-solubilization and SG disassembly in the tps1Δ cells (Fig. 3c ). Metabolomic data showed that Cdc19 re-solubilization coincided with restored cellular energy levels after stress. Whereas cdc19 irrev cells failed to increase their ATP/ADP ratio and maintained high intracellular PEP levels after stress, cdc19 irrev tps1Δ cells consumed PEP and increased their ATP/ADP ratio and ATP levels (Fig. 3d ). As TPS1 deletion could also restore growth and Cdc19 irrev aggregate disassembly in the presence of the respiration inhibitor antimycin A, we conclude that the restoration of energy metabolism depends mainly on reactivation of glycolysis, while oxidative phosphorylation plays a minor role (Extended Data Fig. 2f,g ). Next, we investigated how TPS1 deletion mediates this rescue. We reasoned that Tps1 activity decreases glycolytic flux by diverting G6P from glycolysis into trehalose synthesis generating T6P, which inhibits hexokinase (Fig. 3a ; refs. 27 , 28 , 29 ). Thus, tps1Δ cells contain virtually no trehalose and have enhanced flux through glycolysis, which results in increased levels of the glycolytic intermediate FBP 29 . The levels of FBP tightly correlate with glycolytic flux and cell growth, with low FBP levels reflecting low glycolysis and stressed, quiescent cells, whereas high FBP levels denote high glycolytic flux and favourable growth conditions 38 , 39 . Interestingly, besides being a ‘glycolytic flux sensor’, FBP is also a known allosteric regulator of Cdc19 (ref. 22 ). Thus, increased FBP levels in tps1Δ cells may directly or indirectly play a role in Cdc19 aggregate disassembly. A comparison of intracellular trehalose and FBP levels in heat-shocked cdc19 irrev and cdc19 irrev tps1Δ cells revealed that a lack of Tps1 abrogated trehalose production (Fig. 3e ). Moreover, similar to glucose starvation 29 , heat stress induced a rapid decrease in FBP, however during stress recovery, FBP accumulated to significantly higher levels in cdc19 irrev tps1Δ cells compared with the cdc19 irrev controls (Fig. 3f ). To genetically test whether increased FBP levels mediate the observed rescue of stressed cdc19 irrev cells by tps1Δ , we impaired FBP production by deleting Pfk2 ( pfk2Δ ), the main FBP-producing enzyme 29 . In contrast to the cdc19 irrev tps1Δ cells, the cdc19 irrev tps1Δ pfk2Δ mutants were unable to recover from heat stress, whereas pfk2Δ alone neither significantly reduced the growth rates nor impaired survival to stress (Fig. 3g ). Moreover, the cdc19 irrev tps1Δ pfk2Δ cells were also unable to dissolve Cdc19 irrev aggregates and SGs (Fig. 3h ). Importantly, the levels of Cdc19 were not altered in any of the mutants (Extended Data Fig. 2h ). We conclude that high FBP levels contribute to efficient stress recovery, and Cdc19 amyloid and SG disassembly.

Altered trehalose levels might also influence Cdc19 re-solubilization by other means, as trehalose affects SG dynamics by tuning the cytoplasmic viscosity 40 . Deletion of TPS2 also rescued the aggregate dissolution defects observed in the cdc19 irrev cells (Extended Data Fig. 2i ), although this effect was weaker compared with tps1Δ cells (Fig. 3b ). Although both strains were impaired in trehalose synthesis, only the deletion of TPS1 (and not TPS2 ) resulted in increased post-stress FBP levels in the cdc19 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2j ). We conclude that FBP-dependent and -independent mechanisms cooperate to achieve efficient Cdc19 amyloid disassembly after stress, but increased cytoplasmic viscosity via trehalose breakdown plays a minor role compared with increased FBP levels.
FBP binding regulates Cdc19 amyloid assembly and disassembly

Mechanistically, direct binding of FBP to Cdc19 could reduce aggregation by promoting Cdc19 tetramerization (Fig. 4a (i)), as Cdc19 tetramers are less aggregation-prone than monomers 4 . Alternatively, FBP could directly bind to Cdc19 amyloids and facilitate Cdc19 aggregate and SG disassembly (Fig. 4a (ii)). These two action modes are not mutually exclusive and could cooperate to ensure rapid Cdc19 re-solubilization. A centrifugation assay revealed that incubation of purified Cdc19 WT with 5 mM FBP, but not with its structurally related precursor fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), interfered with aggregate formation (Fig. 4b ). In the presence of FBP, a significant portion of Cdc19 WT indeed remained soluble, with a corresponding decrease in the aggregated pellet fraction. Conversely, the addition of 5 mM ATP, PEP or trehalose did not influence Cdc19 aggregation (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c ). To confirm that FBP reduces Cdc19 aggregation by direct binding, we measured the aggregation behaviour of a Cdc19 point mutant ( cdc19- T403E ) that is unable to bind FBP (Cdc19 ΔFBP ) 41 . Addition of FBP did not interfere with heat shock-induced Cdc19 ΔFBP aggregation (Fig. 4c ). Thus, direct FBP binding to Cdc19 monomers partially prevents amyloid formation by promoting the formation of Cdc19 tetramers (Fig. 4a (i)). However, FBP did not affect Cdc19 irrev aggregate formation (Fig. 4d ), suggesting that this mutant might have a reduced ability to bind FBP and/or to tetramerize. Size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that Cdc19 irrev is fully monomeric both in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 4e,f ). These results imply that the FBP-mediated rescue of Cdc19 irrev in vivo cannot simply be explained by increased tetramerization (Fig. 4a (i)), but FBP must also promote aggregate disassembly (Fig. 4a (ii)). To confirm that direct FBP binding to Cdc19 amyloids is required for their disassembly, we compared the aggregation dynamics of Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 ΔFBP in vivo (Fig. 4g ). Interestingly, Cdc19 ΔFBP was soluble under favourable growth conditions but rapidly formed irreversible aggregates following heat shock, which could not be disassembled after stress recovery. In contrast to Cdc19 irrev , the Cdc19 ΔFBP aggregates could not be rescued by increasing the FBP levels through TPS1 deletion, implying that direct FBP binding to Cdc19 is essential to disassemble Cdc19 amyloids in vivo.

Next, we examined whether FBP is sufficient to disassemble pre-formed Cdc19 amyloids in vitro. We induced fibril formation of purified Cdc19 WT by heat shock and incubated the obtained amyloids with varying FBP concentrations. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the soluble and insoluble fractions after centrifugation revealed no noticeable Cdc19 re-solubilization even upon incubation with FBP in excess (20 mM), thereby indicating that FBP binding is not sufficient to disassemble Cdc19 amyloids in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 3d ). However, FBP bound directly to Cdc19 amyloids and altered their appearance in negative staining TEM. Incubation of pre-formed Cdc19 WT aggregates with FBP (4 mM) resulted in fibrils that were consistently positively stained (of dark colour; Fig. 4h , +FBP) in contrast to the negatively stained fibrils (white) in the absence of FBP. This change from negative (white fibrils) to positive (black fibrils) staining results from acidic FBP molecules bound to fibrils attracting the positively charged uranyl stain. In contrast, incubation of pre-formed Cdc19 WT amyloids with buffer (Fig. 4h , buffer) or F6P (Fig. 4h , +F6P) did not cause any visible changes, so the Cdc19 WT amyloids appeared as negatively stained, needle-like fibrils characterized by smooth edges. Cdc19 ΔFBP amyloid fibrils incubated with FBP also retained their straight, smooth morphology with negative staining even at high concentrations of FBP (8 mM), validating that the observed alterations are induced by direct FBP binding to Cdc19 (Fig. 4h , lower panels). Interestingly, Cdc19 irrev showed intermediate signs of fibril curvature, uneven borders and positive staining compared with Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 ΔFBP , and these changes were apparent only at high FBP concentrations (8 mM), confirming reduced FBP binding by Cdc19 irrev . We conclude that although FBP directly binds to Cdc19 fibrils, binding is not sufficient to trigger Cdc19 amyloid re-solubilization in vitro. However, FBP may facilitate morphological changes and/or factor recruitment that promotes efficient amyloid disassembly observed in vivo.
Chaperones contribute to Cdc19 amyloid re-solubilization

Chaperones such as Hsp104 and Ssa2 have been implicated in remodelling protein assemblies and SGs, and cells lacking HSP104 or SSA1 / 2 are slightly delayed in SG disassembly 17 , 42 , 43 . Thus, we tested whether these chaperones are also involved in Cdc19 disaggregation. We observed that Gdn-HCl-mediated inhibition of Hsp104 activity delayed dissolution of both Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev aggregates in tps1Δ cells (Fig. 5a,b ). Conversely, overexpression of Hsp104 was sufficient to partially restore growth of heat-stressed cdc19 irrev cells (Fig. 5c ), which was further enhanced by a simultaneous increase in Ssa2 levels (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b ). Moreover, Hsp104 overexpression slightly improved the growth of cdc19 irrev tps1Δ mutants after heat stress, indicating that increased FBP and chaperone levels have an additive effect (Fig. 5d ). Increasing the FBP levels by TPS1 deletion allowed rapid growth restart after stress, whereas Hsp104 overexpression seemed to facilitate growth in a later phase, suggesting that high FBP may be particularly important in the initial steps of Cdc19 amyloid disassembly (Extended Data Fig. 4c ). Together, these results imply that FBP binding to Cdc19 initiates aggregate re-solubilization and cooperates with Hsp104 and Ssa2 to disassemble SG in vivo.

FBP binding to Cdc19 amyloids promotes chaperone recruitment

Next, we compared the localization of Cdc19, tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and Hsp104–mCherry or Ssa2–mCherry in wild-type, cdc19 irrev and cdc19 irrev tps1Δ cells. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that Hsp104–mCherry and Ssa2–mCherry co-localized with heat shock-induced Cdc19–GFP aggregates in the majority of wild-type cells (Fig. 6a,b ). However, Hsp104 and Ssa2 were surprisingly not recruited to irreversible Cdc19 irrev aggregates but remained dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Co-localization was restored following TPS1 deletion, consistent with the idea that increased FBP levels and FBP binding to Cdc19 allow chaperone recruitment to SGs (Fig. 6a,b ) to promote Cdc19 and SG re-solubilization (Extended Data Fig. 4d ). To corroborate these results, we examined the co-localization of Hsp104–mCherry with GFP-tagged Cdc19 ΔFBP . As expected, the Cdc19 ΔFBP amyloids failed to recruit Hsp104–mCherry and co-localization could not be restored by TPS1 deletion, confirming that FBP binding to Cdc19 is essential for chaperone recruitment (Fig. 6c ). In this background, Hsp104–mCherry showed a punctate pattern by binding to heat-induced aggregates, but these foci did not co-localize with irreversible Cdc19 ΔFBP amyloids (Fig. 6c ). We thus conclude that FBP binding to Cdc19 aggregates promotes chaperone binding and allows their recruitment to SGs, which is essential for Cdc19 amyloid re-solubilization, restoration of ATP production and SG disassembly.

Wild-type and tps1Δ cells co-expressing mCherry-tagged Hsp104 ( a , c ) or Ssa2 ( b ) and either GFP-tagged Cdc19 WT , Cdc19 irrev or Cdc19 ΔFBP were subjected to heat stress for 30 min at 42 °C and imaged by fluorescence microscopy.

During cell growth, the metabolite FBP is produced through glycolysis and its binding to Cdc19 promotes the formation of active non-aggregation-prone Cdc19 tetramers. During stress, the FBP levels drop rapidly, leading to tetramer disassembly and the accumulation of Cdc19 monomers. In this state, Cdc19 exposes its aggregation-prone LCR and is primed to form Cdc19 amyloids, which are inactive and accumulate in SGs. After stress release, the FBP levels rise and FBP directly binds to Cdc19 amyloids, thereby facilitating the recruitment of Hsp104 and Ssa2 to the aggregates. These chaperones allow re-solubilization of Cdc19 amyloids and the release of Cdc19 monomers. Re-solubilized, active Cdc19 in turn uses PEP to produce ATP, which is required to activate chaperones to further solubilize Cdc19 and increase energy production. This positive feedback loop fuels the disassembly of Cdc19 amyloids and other SG components. Concomitant breakdown of trehalose liberates glucose moieties for glycolysis and modulates cytoplasmic diffusion. Orchestrated disassembly of SGs then releases several mRNAs and metabolic enzymes, and allows full resumption of cell growth and cell-cycle progression.

Discussion

Cell survival under stress conditions requires rapid and reversible implementation of protective measures, including the timely formation and disassembly of reversible aggregates and SGs. Here we show that during stress, the essential ATP-producing enzyme Cdc19 forms proteolysis-resistant reversible amyloids which co-localize with SGs. Aggregation not only protects Cdc19 from stress-induced degradation but also inactivates the enzyme, leading to a rapid decrease of cellular ATP. However, ATP is required for post-stress Cdc19 aggregate and SG disassembly as well as growth restart 14 . We show that Cdc19 amyloid re-solubilization after stress restores the cellular energy levels and that this is essential to disassemble SGs and restart growth. Moreover, our results unravel a multi-step mechanism for Cdc19 amyloid and SG re-solubilization. The glycolytic metabolite FBP regulates the assembly state and activity of Cdc19 in two ways (Fig. 6d ). First, during exponential growth, FBP binds to soluble Cdc19, promoting the formation of active non-aggregating Cdc19 tetramers. During stress, decreasing FBP levels facilitate the formation of aggregation-prone Cdc19 monomers, which assemble into amyloid structures. Second, following stress release, glycolysis restarts and increasing FBP levels trigger Cdc19 re-solubilization. FBP directly binds to Cdc19 amyloids and promotes efficient recruitment of Hsp104 and Ssa2 chaperones. A dedicated algorithm 44 predicts a specific binding site for Hsp70 chaperones co-localizing with the FBP-binding site of Cdc19. Cells expressing a Cdc19 ΔFBP mutant, which cannot bind FBP, fail to recruit chaperones and cannot disassemble Cdc19 aggregates after stress release. Moreover, FBP further increases the ATP production by Cdc19, facilitating chaperone recruitment and activity. Re-solubilized Cdc19 produces ATP, which further fuels Cdc19 amyloid and SG disassembly in a positive feedback loop. Although Hsp104 was identified as the critical ATP-consuming enzyme during this process 14 , other cellular factors such as RNA/DNA-helicases, protein kinases and AAA-ATPases may also contribute to dissolve SGs and restart cell growth 9 . In summary, FBP functions as a ‘glycolytic flux sensor’ 38 , 39 and directly controls Cdc19 amyloid formation and disassembly. The need for ATP production by Cdc19 can be bypassed with non-glycolytic substrates, which are metabolised by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.

Conceptually, our results reveal a mechanism whereby the metabolic and energetic state of the cell is coupled to SG disassembly via the regulated formation of Cdc19 amyloids. We uncovered a crucial function of reversible Cdc19 amyloids in SG regulation and cell survival under stress, highlight Cdc19 amyloids as physiological targets of Hsp104 and Ssa2, and elucidate how functional amyloids can be disassembled in a physiological context. As several metabolic enzymes reversibly aggregate during stress 45 , similar mechanisms may regulate their activity. Finally, although the interplay between physiological and pathological amyloids remains to be explored, understanding the regulation of physiological amyloids might provide important insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
Methods
Media, growth assays, yeast strains and plasmid construction

The yeast strains and plasmids used in this work were obtained using standard molecular biology protocols and are listed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. Unless otherwise stated, yeast cells were cultured at 30 °C in synthetic defined (SD) medium with 2% glucose (2% glucose, 0.5% NH 4 -sulfate, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base and amino acids), as previously described 4 . Where indicated, the 2% glucose in the SD medium was substituted with 2% ethanol. When grown exponentially, cdc19 irrev strains were never allowed to grow above an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of 0.8 to avoid stress conditions. Heat shock was induced by moving exponentially growing cells (OD 600 0.4–0.6) to 42 °C for 30 min. Where indicated, cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich, C-7698) or antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich, A8674) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 25 μg ml −1 or 2 μM (1 μM in SD plates), respectively. Hsp104 activity was inhibited with 5 mM Gdn-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, 50950) for 3 h before stress initiation. Growth rates at 30 °C were determined by measuring the OD 600 in a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One) using a plate reader (BioLector m2p-labs or ClarioStar BMG Labtech) or by imaging serial dilution spottings onto the appropriate SD plates after 3 d. Protein overexpression from estradiol-inducible promoters was achieved by exposing cells to 10 mM estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich, E8875) for 3 h.
Fluorescence microscopy, image analysis and quantification

Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope with the MicroManager v. 1.4 and NIS-Elements Advanced Research v. 5.02 software. For the time-lapse experiments, cells were loaded in microfluidic plates (CellASIC ONIX2, Merck Millipore) at 30 °C 4 . Heat shock was induced with the microfluidic plate temperature controller by increasing the temperature to 42 °C for 30 min before returning it to 30 °C or by moving the cultures to a pre-heated shaking incubator (Kühner, LT W Lab-Therm) at 42 °C for 30 min. Images were recorded every 10 min and quantified as described in the figure legends.
Screen for suppressors of irreversible Cdc19 aggregates

Cells expressing Cdc19 irrev –GFP were cultured in SD-His medium (SD medium lacking His) to an OD 600 of 0.6, heat shocked for 30 min at 42 °C in a shaking incubator (Kühner, LT W Lab-Therm), collected by centrifugation and spread on SD-His plates to single colonies. Individual colonies that survived were isolated and visually inspected by fluorescence microscopy. PYK2 was deleted by homologous recombination to exclude suppressors that upregulate Pyk2. The suppressors were backcrossed to ensure Mendelian segregation and suppressor strains with single gene traits were subjected to whole genome sequencing. The identified mutations were validated by crossing cdc19 irrev strains with full deletions of the mutated gene.
Protein purification

Plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant Cdc19-Strep (Cdc19 fused to a C-terminal Strep-tag) constructs were transformed into E. coli cells (Rosetta). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium (1% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract and 0.5% NaCl), with 30 µg ml −1 chloramphenicol and 100 µg ml −1 carbenicillin, to an OD 600 of 0.6. Protein production was induced by adding 0.1 mM isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactoside (IPTG) and culturing the cells at 16 °C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in pre-cooled lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), protease inhibitor mix (Roche) and 75 U ml −1 of Pierce universal nuclease) and processed for lysis by freezer milling (SPEX SamplePrep 6870 Freezer/Mill; five cycles of 2 min cooling and 2 min grinding at setting 15 CPS). The extracts were cleared by centrifugation (48,000 g, 4 °C, 30 min), and the supernatant was loaded on a Strep-Tactin Superflow Plus column (Qiagen) at 4 °C following the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were eluted using 2.5 mM d -desthiobiotin in purification buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF). Fractions were collected, checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining, and pure fractions were pooled and aliquoted for storage at −80 °C.
Transmission electron microscopy

After thawing on ice, Cdc19 samples were cleared by centrifugation (21,000 g , 4 °C, 10 min), diluted to 0.2 mg ml −1 in purification buffer pH 7.4 and adjusted to pH 6–7. Subsequently, a non-glow discharged carbon film 300 mesh copper grid (CF300-CU, Electron Microscopy Sciences) was submerged in this Cdc19 dilution and incubated for 10 min at 42 °C. Excess sample was then manually removed with Whatman filter paper. Where indicated, grids with pre-formed Cdc19 aggregates were incubated for 20 min with FBP or F6P dissolved in purification buffer to the indicated concentration, or simply washed twice with purification buffer, and stained with two drops of 2% uranyl acetate. A FEI Morgagni 268 microscope at 100 kV with a CCD 1,376 × 1,032 pixel camera at different magnifications was used to acquire the transmission electron micrographs.
In vitro protein-metabolite precipitation

Purified wild-type or mutant Cdc19 was thawed on ice, cleared by centrifugation (21,000 g , 4 °C, 10 min) and diluted to a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg ml −1 in purification buffer. The different metabolites (FBP, F6P, ATP, PEP and trehalose) were solubilized in the same buffer and added to Cdc19 to the indicated final concentrations; the protein-metabolite samples were then incubated for 14 h at 30 °C. The aggregates were pelleted by centrifugation (21,000 g , 4 °C, 10 min) and separated from the supernatant containing soluble Cdc19. Aggregation was quantified by loading the pellet and supernatant on an SDS-PAGE gel, followed by Coomassie blue staining and quantification using the FIJI (ImageJ, v. 2.0.0) software.
In vitro aggregate re-solubilization with FBP

Purified wild-type Cdc19 was heat shocked for 10 min at 42 °C and the resulting aggregates were incubated with purification buffer or 20 mM FBP for 5 h at 4 °C. The aggregates were pelleted by centrifugation (21,000 g , 4 °C, 10 min) and Cdc19 re-solubilization in the presence or absence of FBP was quantified by loading the supernatant and pellet fractions on an SDS-PAGE gel, followed by Coomassie blue staining.
Metabolite extraction and LC-MS/MS measurements

For metabolite extraction, 1 ml cultures were vacuum-filtered on a PVDF filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm (Millipore) and the cell pellets were immediately transferred into 4 ml of −20 °C cold extraction solution (40:40:20 acetonitrile/methanol/water; HPLC-grade solvents) supplemented with 200 µl of 13 C internal standard and incubated at −20 °C for 2 h. The extraction solution was centrifuged (4,000 r.p.m., 0 °C, 15 min) and the supernatant containing the metabolites was transferred to fresh tubes. The samples were dried overnight in a SpeedVac and stored at −80 °C. The samples were resuspended in 100 µl ddH 2 O before the targeted metabolomics measurements were performed.

Compounds were analysed using a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system consisting of a 1290 Infinity LC (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a 5500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex) in negative multiple-reaction-monitoring scan mode. The metabolite extracts (5 μl) were injected on an Agilent PoroShell 120 HILIC-Z column (150 × 2.1 mm, 2.7 μm) using a mobile phase A (water, 10 mM ammonium acetate and 5 μM medronic acid, pH 9) and mobile phase B (90% acetonitrile, 10% water, 10 mM ammonium acetate and 5 μM medronic acid, pH 9) at a constant flow rate of 250 μl min −1 . The gradient was as follows: 10% phase A; 2 min, 10% phase A; 12 min, 40% phase A; 15 min, 40% phase A; 16 min, 10% phase A; and 24 min, 10% phase A. The multiple-reaction-monitoring settings were adapted from Yuan and colleagues 47 . The raw data were processed and analysed using a proprietary software in MatLab (Mathworks); the exact choice of software is not essential for reproducing the results.

The intracellular metabolite concentration was calculated based on the measured 12 C/ 13 C ratio, assuming a dry weight 48 of 0.53 g l −1 per OD 600 unit and a cell volume 49 of 0.002 l g −1 . Calibration curves were obtained from dilutions of pure compounds containing equal amounts of 13 C internal standard.
Protein extraction and western blotting

Proteins were precipitated using a TCA/acetone-based protocol. Briefly, exponentially growing cells were incubated for 10 min on ice after the addition of 10% TCA and centrifuged (21,000 g , 4 °C, 5 min), and the pellets were washed twice with acetone. The precipitated proteins were resuspended using an SDS-based loading buffer and the protein levels were quantified by western blotting with specific antibodies. The following antibodies were used: anti-GFP (Roche, 11 814 460 001; 1:3,000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti-Crm1 antibody (provided by K. Weis; 1:3,000 dilution), anti-Pgk1 (Invitrogen, 459250; 1:3,000 dilution), horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, 170-6516; 1:3,000 dilution) and anti-Hsp104 (Abcam, ab69549; 1:1,000 dilution).
Pyruvate kinase activity assay

The pyruvate kinase activity was measured with an enzymatic assay where pyruvate production by Cdc19 is coupled to lactate production by lactate dehydrogenase and the simultaneous conversion of NADH to NAD+ is measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Purified Cdc19 was diluted to 0.2 mg ml −1 and either kept on ice or heat shocked for 60 min at 42 °C. Soluble or aggregated Cdc19 was diluted in activity buffer (50 mM imidazole pH 7, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM ADP, 0.3 mM NADH and 10 U ml −1 LDH) to a final protein concentration of 2 μg ml −1 . Reactions were started by adding PEP (final concentration of 2 mM) and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm over time was monitored.
Size-exclusion chromatography

Purified wild-type or mutant Cdc19 was thawed on ice and cleared by centrifugation (21,000 g , 4 °C, 10 min). Protein (0.1 mg) was loaded on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) connected to an ÄKTA pure system (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. Protein elution was followed by the measurement of ultraviolet light absorbance (at 215 nm and 280 nm), and the collected fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining.

Lysates for size-exclusion chromatography were prepared by culturing cells expressing wild-type or mutant Cdc19–GFP in SD medium to an OD 600 of 0.6. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS buffer pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20, 20 mM β-glycero-phosphate, 1 mM vanadate, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor mix (Roche)), mixed with glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, 425–600 µm) and lysed with a FastPrep homogenizer (FastPrep-24 5G, MP Biochemicals). The resulting extracts were cleared by centrifugation (21,000g, 4 °C, 10 min) and filtering (0.2 µm filter; Millipore). The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using a NanoDrop and a total of 4 mg protein was loaded on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) connected to an ÄKTA pure system (GE Healthcare). The column was previously equilibrated in lysis buffer and run according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fractions were collected and analysed by western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies.
Circular dichroism, Thioflavin T and Congo red staining in vitro

Circular dichroism spectra of purified wild-type or mutant Cdc19 (0.2 mg ml −1 ) were measured using a J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) and a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm.

For in vitro measurements with the amyloid dyes, Thioflavin T (Sigma-Aldrich, T3516) or Congo red (Sigma-Aldrich, 75768-25MG) were dissolved in purification buffer to a final concentration of 2.5 mM or 1 mM, respectively, and filtered (0.2 µm; Millipore). The purified wild-type or mutant Cdc19 was thawed on ice, cleared by centrifugation (21,000 g , 4 °C, 10 min), diluted to 0.3 mg ml −1 in purification buffer and then either heat shocked (10 min, 42 °C) or kept on ice. Thioflavin T or Congo red solution was added (1:10 dilution) and the fluorescence intensity was measured in a 384-well plate (Corning Life Sciences) at the indicated temperature using a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech). For Thioflavin T, excitation was set at 450 nm and emission spectra were recorded at 490 nm. For Congo red, the fluorescence intensity was measured at 614 nm with an excitation at 560 nm.
Congo red staining ex vivo

For the ex vivo Congo red staining, cells expressing wild-type or mutant Cdc19–GFP were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS buffer pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20 and 1 mM PMSF) and lysed at 4 °C with glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich; 425–600 μm) and a FastPrep homogenizer (FastPrep-24 5G, MP Biochemicals). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (2,000 g , 4 °C, 2 min) and the total protein concentration was determined using a NanoDrop. Glass microscopy slides were cleaned with consecutive washes of H 2 O, 100% ethanol and acetone, before 3 mm-wide stripes of double-sided tape were applied along the length of the glass slides to form three channels (approximatively 3 mm-wide). The assembled flow chambers were functionalized by incubation for 20 min with 0.3 mg ml −1 Avidin DN (Vector Laboratories) in T50 buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 50 mM NaCl), blocked for 30 min with 0.1% puronic F-127 (Sigma-Aldrich) in T50 buffer, washed twice with 0.1 mg ml −1 BSA in T50 buffer and incubated for 30 min with biotinylated G-protein in lysis buffer. Finally, 10 nM anti-GFP in lysis buffer was flushed into the channels, and the protein extracts were loaded and allowed to bind for 10 min, before washing three times with lysis buffer. The aggregates were stained with 250 µM Congo red in lysis buffer, excess dye was removed by washing twice with lysis buffer and the aggregates were analysed by fluorescence microscopy.
LiP-MS experiments, SRM assays and quantification analysis

For the in vivo LiP-MS experiments, cells expressing Cdc19 WT –GFP or Cdc19 irrev –GFP were cultured in SD medium and three biological replicates were collected when the cells were growing exponentially (OD 600 of 0.6) or following entry into stationary phase (2 d). The cells were resuspended in 100 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 (pH 7.6), and disrupted by bead beating in the presence of acid-washed glass beads in three consecutive rounds of 30 s of beating and 4 min of incubation at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the yeast extracts was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA protein assay kit, Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of cell lysates were treated with proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) at a lysate/protease ratio of 100:1 for 3 min. Protease activity was quenched by heating at 95 °C and adding 5% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich) 50 . Equal amounts of cell lysates were treated in parallel with vehicle instead of proteinase K to estimate the variation in Cdc19 protein amounts in the different conditions assayed. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-HCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to a final concentration of 5 mM (35 min, 37 °C) to reduce disulfide bridges, followed by alkylation of free cysteine residues with iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 20 mM (30 min, room temperature). The peptide and protein fragments were digested to completion in denaturing conditions with LysC and trypsin proteases. Before adding LysC and trypsin, the reaction mixtures were diluted with 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) to reach a sodium deoxycholate concentration of <1%. First, LysC digestion was performed at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 for 4 h at 37 °C, then trypsin digestion was carried out at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 for 16 h at 37 °C. For the LiP experiments with recombinantly purified proteins, aliquots of recombinantly purified Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C or 42 °C in triplicates to induce Cdc19 structural variations just before the limited proteolysis step.

The development and validation of the Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) assays to measure Cdc19 levels were guided by a spectral library generated in-house through an LC-MS/MS analysis of the in vivo yeast samples on a QE-plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source. On-line chromatographic separation of the peptides was achieved with an Easy-nLC 1000 nano liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a 40 cm fused-silica column (New Objective), packed in-house with Reprosil Pur C18 Aq, 1.9 µm beads (Dr Maisch). The peptide mixtures (approximately 1 µg) were separated with a linear gradient from 5% to 35% acetonitrile in 120 min. The collected spectra were searched against the Saccharomyces cerevisiae UniProt reference database using Sorcerer-Sequest (Thermo Electron). Trypsin was set as the digesting protease tolerating two missed cleavages and semi-tryptic termini. Cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.0214 Da) was defined as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation (+15.99492 Da) as a variable modification. Protein identifications were filtered with a false-discovery rate of <1%, calculated on the basis of a target-decoy approach. Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to build a consensus spectral library using LiP-MS in vivo samples.

Peptides matching to the spectral library were ranked by intensity using Skyline (v4.1; MacCoss Lab Software, University of Washington) and the ten most intense transitions consisting of doubly or triply charged precursor ions and singly or doubly charged fragment ions of the y- and b-ion series were experimentally tested in SRM mode to select the most suitable transitions for quantification. Samples were measured on a triple quadrupole/ion-trap mass spectrometer (5500 QTrap, AB Sciex) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source and operated in SRM mode. On-line chromatographic peptide separation was achieved with an Eksigent 1D-plus Nano liquid chromatography system equipped with a 15 cm fused-silica column with an inner diameter of 75 µm, packed in-house with Reprosil Pur C18 Aq, 5 µm beads (Dr Maisch). The peptide mixtures (approximately 1 µg) were separated with a linear gradient from 5% to 35% acetonitrile in 30 min. The SRM analysis was conducted with Q1 and Q3 operated at unit resolution (0.7  m / z half-maximum peak width) with a dwell time of 20 ms and a cycle time <3.0 s.

The SRM mass spectrometry data were analysed using Skyline, and for the final SRM assay, retention times were scheduled and at least three transitions per precursor ion of Cdc19 were retained. The identity of each SRM peak was confirmed against the spectral library by matching realigned retention times and relative fragment-ion intensities. 199 transitions matching to 44 Cdc19 precursors were selected for Cdc19 peptide quantification purposes. Integration of peak areas was manually inspected and relative quantification was performed for the Cdc19 peptides in the LiP-MS in vitro and in vivo experiments. Statistical significance analysis was performed using MSstats ( www.msstats.org ). Precursor intensities were normalized using the option ‘equalize medians’ of MSstats. In the LiP-MS in vivo experiments, peptide intensities were corrected for variations of Cdc19 protein levels between the exponential and stationary conditions. The normalization factor applied was equivalent to the relative variation of the Cdc19 WT or Cdc19 irrev proteins between the exponential and stationary conditions.
Statistics and reproducibility

All data are representative results from at least three independent experiments, unless otherwise specified in the figure legends. Whenever possible, the mean ± s.e.m. and individual data points of individual experiments are shown. GraphPad Prism was used to analyse and plot data. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size and the experiments were not randomized. No outlier tests were performed and no data were excluded from the analyses. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during the experiments and outcome assessment.

Extended data
Extended Data Fig. 1 Cdc19 aggregates are amyloids both in vitro and in vivo.

a , Schematic representation of the domains of Cdc19. The four mutated residues located within the LCR in the Cdc19 irrev mutant are indicated (red circles). b , c , Both Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev form ThT- and Congo Red (CR)-positive aggregates upon heat shock in vitro. Purified Cdc19 WT , Cdc19 irrev and a non-aggregating Cdc19 mutant as negative control (Cdc19 ΔPEP 4 ) were incubated with ThT (b) or CR (c) at 4 °C or after heat shock (42 °C, 10 min). Fluorescence emission was measured at 490 nm or 614 nm, respectively. The mean ± s.e.m. is shown ( n  = 3 independent experiments, two-tailed t-tests, ThT: P WT  = 0.0000149, P irrev  = 0.0091, CR: P WT  = 0.0003, P irrev  = 0.0128). d , In vivo-formed Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev aggregates are CR-positive. Cells expressing GFP-tagged Cdc19 WT or Cdc19 irrev were harvested when exponentially growing or after heat shock (42 °C, 30 min) and lysed. Cdc19–GFP was immobilized in a GFP-trap microfluidic chamber and stained with CR. GFP and CR signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy, and merged to visualize co-localization. Arrowheads indicate CR-positive Cdc19–GFP aggregates ( n = 3 independent experiments). Scale bars; 10 μm. e , Limited-Proteolysis Mass Spectrometry (LiP-MS) results indicate that Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev undergo comparable structural transitions upon aggregation in vitro and in vivo. Purified soluble or aggregated (42 °C, 10 min) Cdc19 WT or Cdc19 irrev , as well as cell extracts obtained from cells expressing Cdc19 WT -GFP or Cdc19 irrev -GFP harvested during exponential growth or stationary phase (2 d) to induce aggregation were analysed by LiP-MS as described in the Methods ( n  = 3 independent experiments). Peptides detected in soluble and aggregated Cdc19 WT and Cdc19 irrev are displayed in volcano plots, and upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue) conformation-sensitive peptides are highlighted. Conformation-specific LiP-MS-peptides detected in vitro and in vivo were mapped to the Cdc19 schematic drawing (green). f , Intracellular ATP levels (mM) were determined in the indicated strains after heat shock (42 °C, 30 min) and recovery (30 °C, 60 min). The mean ± s.e.m. of n  = 5 independent experiments is shown (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, ** P  = 0.0079); a.u., arbitrary units. Source data for all graphical representations are found in Source Data Extended Data Fig. 1.

Extended Data Fig. 2 Genetic screening identifies trehalose metabolism as a regulator of reversible Cdc19 aggregation.

a , Screening protocol that identified a single point mutation (G386D) in TPS3 as a suppressor of stress-induced growth arrest of cdc19 irrev cells. b , d , Serial dilutions of the indicated exponentially growing strains were spotted on agar plates before or after heat shock (42 °C, 30 min), and imaged after 3 d at 30 °C ( n = 3 independent experiments). c , Exponentially growing tps3-G385D cells expressing Cdc19 irrev -GFP and Pab1–CFP were cultivated at 30 °C, then heat shocked (42 °C, 30 min) and allowed to recover at 30 °C. The mean ± s.e.m. percentage of cells with Cdc19 aggregates is indicated ( n  = 3 independent experiments, >30 cells per sample per experiment). Scale bar; 5 μm. e , Intracellular disaccharides were measured in the indicated strains before, during and after heat shock (42 °C, 30 min). The mean ± s.e.m. is shown ( n  = 5 independent experiments for wild-type, n  = 3 independent experiments for tps1Δ and tps2Δ , two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, ** P  = 0.0079). f , g , The indicated exponentially growing strains were heat shocked (42 °C, 30 min) and allowed to recover at 30 °C ± antimycin A (1 or 2 μM, respectively). f , Serial dilutions were spotted on agar plates ± antimycin A before or after heat shock, and imaged after 3 d at 30 °C ( n = 3 independent experiments). g , Plots indicate mean percentage of cells that re-solubilized Cdc19 ( n = 2 independent experiments). h , Mean Cdc19–GFP levels relative to Pgk1 in the indicated strains are shown ( n = 2 independent experiments). i , Exponentially growing tps2Δ cells expressing Cdc19 irrev -–GFP and Pab1–CFP were heat shocked (42 °C, 30 min) and allowed to recover at 30 °C. Plot indicates the mean ± s.e.m. percentage of cells with Cdc19 aggregates ( n  = 3 independent experiments, >30 cells per sample per experiment). Scale bar; 5 µm. j , Intracellular disaccharides (mainly trehalose 46 ) and FBP were measured in the indicated strains before, during and after heat shock (42 °C, 30 min), and plotted as mean ± s.e.m. ( n  = 4 independent experiments for cdc19 irrev tps2Δ , n  = 5 for cdc19 irrev , two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, * P Disaccharides  = 0.0159, * P FBP  = 0.0317); a.u., arbitrary units. Source data for all graphical representations and unprocessed western blots available in Source Data Extended Data Fig. 2.

Extended Data Fig. 3 FBP specifically reduces aggregation of purified Cdc19 WT but not Cdc19 ΔFBP and Cdc19 irrev mutant proteins.

a – c , Purified wild-type Cdc19 (a) , FBP binding-deficient Cdc19 ΔFBP mutant (b) or Cdc19 irrev mutant (c) proteins were mixed as indicated with 5 mM FBP or for control 5 mM F6P, 5 mM ATP, 5 mM PEP, 5 mM trehalose or buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 14 h. Cdc19 aggregates were separated from soluble protein by centrifugation and the supernatant (Sup) and pellet fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. The amount of Cdc19 was quantified in the pellet and supernatant by measuring Cdc19 band intensities using ImageJ and normalizing to buffer controls, and is displayed as mean ± s.e.m. ( n = 3 independent experiments, two-tailed t-test, *P  = 0.0342). d , Addition of FBP alone is not sufficient to re-solubilize pre-formed Cdc19 WT amyloids in vitro. Purified Cdc19 WT (Input) was incubated for 10 min at 42 °C to trigger its aggregation, and the resulting amyloids were incubated with (20 mM) or without (0 mM) FBP for several hours. Cdc19 re-solubilization was then tested by centrifugation and analysis of the resulting supernatant (Sup) and pellet fractions by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining ( n = 3 independent experiments); a.u., arbitrary units. Unprocessed original scans of gels are shown in Source Data Extended Data Fig. 3.

Extended Data Fig. 4 The chaperones Hsp104 and Ssa2 cooperate with FBP to efficiently disassemble Cdc19 amyloids in vivo.

a , Co-overexpression of Hsp104 and Ssa2 partially restores growth of cdc19 irrev cells after heat stress. Wild-type and cdc19 irrev cells overexpressing as indicated Hsp104 or Ssa2, or both together by addition of 10 mM estradiol for 3 h, were heat-shocked for 30 min at 42 °C. Serial dilutions were spotted on agar plates and grown at 30 °C for 3 d ( n = 3 independent experiments). b , Hsp104 protein levels were quantified in the indicated strains by western blotting either in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 10 mM estradiol for 3 h ( n = 3 independent experiments). c , Increased FBP levels and Hsp104 cooperate to efficiently restart growth after stress in cdc19 irrev cells. Exponentially growing wild-type or tps1Δ cells expressing either Cdc19 WT or Cdc19 irrev were subjected to a 30 min heat shock at 42 °C. Where indicated, overexpression of Hsp104 was induced by treating cells with 10 mM estradiol for 3 h. Growth restart after stress release of the indicated strains was quantified by measuring the cell density (OD 600 ) over time after inoculation of equal cell numbers at 30 °C. Mean ± s.e.m. cell density 22 h after stress release is shown ( n = 3 independent experiments). Note that Hsp104 overexpression and increased FBP levels cooperate to rescue cdc19 irrev cells after heat shock. d , Wild-type or tps1Δ cells co-expressing mCherry-tagged Hsp104 and either GFP-tagged Cdc19 WT or Cdc19 irrev mutant were heat shocked (42 °C, 30 min), and imaged by fluorescence microscopy at the times indicated. Representative GFP- (left row) and mCherry images (middle row) are shown, together with the merged image (bottom row) to visualize co-localization of Cdc19 aggregates and Hsp104 ( n = 3 independent experiments). Scale bars; 5 μm; a.u., arbitrary units. Source data for the graphical representation and unprocessed western blots can be found in Source Data Extended Data Fig. 4.
