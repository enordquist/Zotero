I. INTRODUCTION
Proteins are synthesized in cells by a stepwise process in which amino acids are added, one by one, from the NH2-tennini of the chains (Bishop et al., 1960; Dintzis, 1961; Canfield and Anfinsen, 1963; Naughton and Dintzis, 1962). The folding of such nascent chains can occur spontaneously without the need for any additional information beyond that contained in the amino acid sequence and its surroundings; the same is true of “structureless” unaggregated polypeptides produced by denaturation of native molecules. The experimental evidence that supports this conclusion has been reviewed in some detail elsewhere (Epstein e t al., 1963; Anfinsen, 1966, 1973; Wetlaufer and Ristow, 1973). The term “protein folding” refers to the processes involved in the conversion of an ensemble of newly synthesized (or denatured) polypeptide chain conformations to the unique three-dimensional conformation of the

native protein. When present, disulfide bonds serve to stabilize the native conformation by reducing the structural fluctuations of alternative (denatured) forms (Schellman, 1955; Flory, 1956; Scheraga,
1963). In some cases, it has been found that the attainment of the
final native conformation depends on the presence of specific
ligands, frequently metal ions or prosthetic groups (although with many enzymes these may be the substrate molecules themselves). The presence of ligands does not necessarily lead to a significantly different conformation of the folded protein, but helps to stabilize
the native form (Schechter et al., 1969; Taniuchi et al., 1969). It is currently believed that the three-dimensional structure of the native
protein in a given environment (solvent, pH, ionic strength, presence of other components, temperature, etc.) is the one in which the Gibbs free energy of the whole system is a minimum with respect to all degrees of freedom, i.e., that the native conformation is deter-
mined by the various interatomic interactions and hence by the amino acid sequence, in a given environment. Whether or not this
“local” minimum in the free energy hyperspace is the global one is
at present an unsettled question. Since it seems quite reasonable, on the basis of the available
experimental data, to accept the hypothesis of spontaneous folding to a unique structure, it is of interest to consider the way in which such a conversion from “one” to “three” dimensions occurs, and the nature and magnitude of the interactions necessary to determine a specific structure. It has been suggested (Levinthal, 1968) that the structure of a native protein might occasionally represent a unique metastable state, not necessarily the one of lowest free energy. Such a view would require that the folding of the chain occur by means of a specific pathway which could lead to the metastable state only by following an ordered sequence of events. One suggestion (Phillips, 1967; Chantrenne, 1961; Dunnill, 1965, 1967) proposes that the chain folds as it is synthesized from the NH,- to the COOH-terminus. Both stereochemical considerations and experiments on protein folding in solution make these ideas unlikely. Despite the possible presence of high energetic barriers between conformational states, the conformational space seems to be sufficiently large for pathways around these barriers to exist, enabling the flexible polypeptide
chain to attain its most stable conformation (Hantgan et al., 1974). To be more precise, one should distinguish between proteins that
consist of a single chain and those containing more than one, noncovalently bonded chain (subunits). In the former case, the amino acid sequence is presumably such that no decrease in free energy

from intermolecular interactions is possible at low temperature, and the protein is stable in a single-chain (folded) form. In other cases, the amino acid sequence has evolved (to achieve a particular biological advantage) so that favorable intermolecular interactions (in addition to the intramolecular ones) can decrease the free energy of the system by forming multisubunit (folded) aggregates, and even larger organized structures.’
Evidence is now accumulating to suggest that nearest-neighbor, short-range interactions play the dominant role in determining the conformational preferences of the backbones of the various amino acids, but that next-nearest neighbor (medium-range) interactions and, to a lesser extent, long-range interactions involving the rest of the protein chain are required to provide the incremental free energy to stabilize the backbone of the native structure (Scheraga, 1973b, 1974a,b). The basis for this view comes from helix-probability profiles of denatured proteins and their correlation with helical regions in native proteins, from the ability to predict with some success the location of helix, extended structures, and p-turns in native proteins, from conformational energy calculations on short oligopeptides, and from experiments on the folding of protein fragments and sets of complementary protein fragments. In contrast, the conformations of the side chains of a native protein may be influenced more by long-, rather than by short-range, interactions, Thus, it is thought that short-range interactions lead to one or more backbone nucleation sites’ along the chain, where there is a tendency to form specific structures resembling the native conformations; these various sites acquire additional stability from medium-range interactions and are
’ It may be noted that even a single-chain protein can undergo a decrease in free
energy, for example, by heating to form an aggregated complex. Several possibilities then exist. If the native protein is the more stable one at the lower temperature, the denatured aggregate may either revert spontaneously to the native protein, or be prevented from doing so by kinetic barriers, when the temperature is lowered. Alternatively, if the denatured aggregate is the more stable form at the lower temperature, kinetic barriers could prevent the denaturation of the native protein at a low temperature. In any case, it is postulated that a reasonable amount of conformation space is accessible in going from the newly synthesized chain to the folded, native structure, without interference from intervening barriers, but that such barriers may exist to prevent the conversion of the protein from the native to an aggregated denatured form (conversion to an unaggregated denatured form upon heating is postulated to be reversible when the temperature is lowered).
The term “nucleation site” is used here to designate a portion of the amino acid sequence in which the “native format” or conformation can form, i.e., a region in which a specific local backbone conformation has a tendency to form because of shortand medium-range interactions. However, it becomes stabilized in the specific con-

directed toward each other (possibly by formation of p-turns at intervening sites) to bring on the long-range interactions required for stabilization of the whole (backbone and side-chain) structure. One can thus envisage several possible pathways for folding, involving many intermediate states.
The location of the nucleation sites and their stabilization by medium-range interactions (i,e., the propensity for certain portions of the chain to adopt the “native format”), and the specific long-range interactions brought about, say by p-turns, depend on the amino acid sequence and on the environment of the chain. The amino acid sequence, in turn, is selected during evolution to lead to a particular biological function; the resulting sequence enables proper folding to take place according to the dictates of thermodynamics -that is, the free energy of the system must be a minimum. In prebiotic synthesis, a very large number of amino acid sequences must have been generated, and the probability that one of them would fold into a compact globular structure with biological activity was essentially zero. However, a limited number of amino acid sequences have been selected to lead to a particular biological function. Selection may take place not only for biological function but also for stability of the molecule chosen for such function, as, for example, in the case of the enzymes of thermophilic bacteria.
Since the folding of any sequence in a given environment follows thermodynamic requirements, it has been advantageous to use synthetic polypeptides (which are simple, well-characterized models of natural, more complex polypeptides) to determine the magnitudes of interactions that are operative not only in the synthetic system but, by inference, also in the natural one. The helix-coil transition in synthetic homopolymers and copolymers, spectroscopic studies of the conformations of oligopeptides, the study of reversible protein denaturation, and the folding of recombined protein fragments (natural, and synthetically modified) are the basic experimental approaches for determining the nature and magnitude of the interactions which determine how the natural polypeptide chain folds into the native conformation of a globular protein.

formation only when long-range interactions come into play. In using this term, nothing is implied about the temporal sequence of folding; that is, nucleation sites may become stabilized in their native form at various stages in the folding sequence. Such nucleation sites may be regular-for example, a-helices, extended structures, and p-turns-or nonregular, but specifically folded forms. One of the first nucleation sites in the folding of ribonuclease A has been postulated to be nonregular (Burgess and Scheraga, 19751));see Fig. 20.

This chapter correlates the growing body of experimental and theoretical evidence with a model for the process of protein folding which involves, for any particular molecule in solution, several portions of the amino acid sequence of the completed polypeptide chain, each participating in an equilibrium between a random set of states and the “native format” which it possesses when it is part of the ordered three-dimensional structure of the protein. The successful transition from a random polypeptide chain to a native protein then involves further interactions between two or more such regions which have a tendency to adopt the “native format.” Nucleation of the folded conformation would be highly favored in portions of the amino acid sequence that have a high probability of forming the “native format” in aqueous solution.
11. SPONTANEOUS FOLDINGOF PROTEINS
It has been known for many years that proteins can be made to undergo reversible denaturation. In his classical review in Advances in Protein Chemistry, Anson (1945)pointed out: “Hemoglobin which has been denatured in a variety of ways can be converted back into native protein which has the same solubility as the original protein, is crystallizable, has the characteristic spectrum of native hemoglobin, can combine loosely with oxygen, has the same relative affinities for carbon monoxide and oxygen, and is not readily digested by trypsin.” These experiments (Anson and Mirsky, 1934b) and many others, such as those of Northrop (1932) and Anson and Mirsky (1934a) on trypsin and chymotrypsin and their zymogens, clearly showed that the biological properties of the protein molecule in solution are directly related to its chemical properties, and that refolding of a denatured protein to the native form can occur spontaneously. An abundance of later studies have supported this idea.
The early work was hampered by the almost total lack of knowledge of the chemical structure of proteins, and conclusions about renaturation were necessarily phenomenological. Two developments helped to convert the study of protein folding into a field in which a quantitative description could be attempted: first, the basic experiments of Sanger (1956), Moore and Stein and their colleagues (Hirs, 1960; Smyth et ul., 1962, 1963), and others on amino acid sequences and covalent cross-linkages in protein molecules; and second, the examination of the refolding of proteins containing disulfide bonds after these had been broken by reductive cleavage in denaturing solvents (Sela et ul., 1957; White, 1961; Anfinsen et al., 1961). The latter studies helped to dramatize the precision of the natural

The statistics of the process of random formation of n SS bonds from 2n SH groups (Kauzmann, 1959a; SeIa and Lifson, 1959) are shown in Table I. With pancreatic ribonuclease, n = 4 and one of 105 possibilities represents the native
Most protein chains do not contain disulfide bonds or other covalent crosslinkages. Although, in those cases studied to date (Epstein et al., 1971a) proteins without cross-links appear to fold more rapidly than those containing disulfide bonds, it is not known whether this is a general phenomenon under physiological conditions where (correct) disulfide bond pairing could conceivably increase the rate. In either case, the rate would be affected by the extent to which the chain explores the states of

state. With an immunoglobulin containing 23 SS bonds, on the
order of 2 x lozxpossibilities exist. In spite of the small chance for
random formation of the correct set of disulfide bonds, close to quantitative yields can be obtained from a number of fully reduced proteins, e.g., native ribonuclease (Anfinsen and Haber, 1961) and a specific antibody (Freedman and Sela, 1966), when care is taken to provide the proper environmental conditions during the oxidation process.
The precision of the factors that select for one set of SS bonds is also shown by experiments on the interchange of incorrectly formed internal disulfide bonds (Haber and Anfinsen, 1962). If reduced ribonuclease is oxidized in 8 M urea, a product is obtained which contains a large number (within the constraints of avoiding steric hindrance) of the 105 possible isomeric forms. When the urea is removed, exposure of such “scrambled” material to a small amount
of a sulfhydryl group-containing reagent such as mercaptoethanol at neutral or slightly alkaline pH, or exposure to a disulfide-interchange
enzyme, leads to interchange of half-cystine residues with essentially quantitative production of the native enzyme (Fig. 1).
Actually, the formation of the disulfide bonds of ribonuclease does not lead immediately to the native conformation, as can be seen from the data of Fig. 2, which pertain to disulfide-bond formation in the presence of oxidized and reduced glutathione (Hantgan et al., 1974). The disappearance of free SH groups is much more rapid than the regain of properties associated with the native conformation. This indicates that there is an initial formation of (probably many) wrong SS bonds, which slowly anneal to the correct SS-bond arrangement. This conclusion is supported by the results of peptide analysis (showing which sulfhydryl groups are paired) during the course of
SS-bond formation (Hantgan et al., 1974). In the case of lysozyme, it
appears that only a very limited number of structures are formed in the early stages of the reoxidation (Ristow and Wetlaufer, 1973) and, in the case of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, it has been possible to detect several transient intermediates with an incomplete set of disulfide bonds (Creighton, 1974).

influences as, for example, the tendency to form helical sections, extended structures,

with which the total interactions between amino acid side chains lead to a unique

thermodynamically stable structure, and current studies (e.g., Sachs et al., 1972a,b,c)

have been concerned with determining those aspects of nucleation and folding that

make possible the extreme rapidity with which native protein structures are formed.

with those of Haber and Anfinsen (1962) cited above, demonstrate the strong thermodynamic force which drives the conformation from a “scrambled” set of isomers (of high free energy) to the native structure (of lower free energy) and also indicate that the native conformation is attainable from many different conformations; the latter observation supports the argument that the native conformation may not be a metastable one.
The study of the folding process in single-chain disulfide bondcontaining proteins has been reviewed extensively (Epstein et al., 1963; Wetlaufer and Ristow, 1973), and the so-called “thermodynamic hypothesis,” stated in the Introduction, appears to be generally applicable. This hypothesis is also thought to apply to globular proteins that contain more than one chain (subunits), where folding of the subunits and the formation of the multichain complex is determined by both intrachain and interchain interactions. However, in this review we shall limit our discussion primarily to a consideration of the factors that underlie the folding of a newly synthesized, singlechain protein, and not treat proteins with subunits.
It is not necessary that the amino acid sequence be a unique one to obtain a particular three-dimensional structure or a closely homologous one. The genetic information encoded in the primary sequence of a protein may be modified naturally by mutations or experimentally in a number of ways without destroying the capacity of the resulting chain (or chain fragments) to assume the native or similar conformation. For example, the structures of some of the hemoglobins, myoglobins, cytochrome c’s, etc., of different species are apparently unaltered by many such substitutions (Perutz and Lehmann, 1968). On the other hand, some nonlethal substitutions occasionally lead to an altered conformation of the native protein, as occurs in several mutant hemoglobins and in immunologically different variants of tryptophan synthetase (Helinski and Yanofsky, 1963). (The alteration in structure is usually inferred from an alteration in biological activity, although this need not be so; that is, a conformational change could occur without a change in biological activity.) The ability of the chain to tolerate such substitutions in some cases, but not in others, is now understood (Lewis and Scheraga, 1971a) in terms of the preservation (or nonpreservation) of similar interatomic interactions (preserving specific local conformations), when one amino acid is substituted for another (see Section VIII,B,5). In fact, different proteins, which have a high degree of similarity in their amino acid sequences [such as chymotrypsin, trypsin, elastase, and thrombin (Hartley, 1970), or lysozyme and a-

2 14

lactalbumin (Brew and Campbell, 1967; Brew et al., 1970)], have, or are thought to have, similar three-dimensional structures, It has also been shown that functionally related proteins (e.g., the NAD binding dehydrogenases) have similar structures (Branden et al., 1973; Hill et al., 1972; Jornvall, 1973;Rossmann et al., 1971). Such amino acid substitutions (produced either naturally or synthetically) can be more easily accommodated in the native structure if they occur on the “outside” of the protein at the protein-solvent interface (Perutz and Lehmann, 1968), presumably because more redundancy is permissible in the conformation-preserving interactions involving the outside residues (which may serve primarily to keep the protein soluble in water). On the “inside,” the long-range interactions that determine the packing of the side chains could be more easily disrupted by substitutions. Of course, if a residue at an active site is modified, then the biological specificity will be altered.
An illustrative experiment carried out some years ago (Cooke et al., 1963), on the ease with which modifications of the residues at the protein-solvent interface can be accommodated, is summarized in the schematic drawing shown in Fig. 3. Ribonuclease can be converted from its native, globular state with four disulfide bonds to an open, random coil by reduction of these SS bonds with mercaptoethanol in urea solution. As mentioned earlier, reoxidation with molecular oxygen yields the original native structure containing the properly paired SH groups in disulfide linkage. When, as indicated in Fig. 3, eight of the eleven free amino groups are modified by the addition of (water-soluble) poly-DL-alanine chains containing as
many as eight alanine monomers per chain, the enzyme retains its full activity as well as many of its native, physical properties, Such derivatives also retain the capacity to undergo completely reversible reduction and reoxidation of the four SS bonds. Thus, the long chains of poly-DL-alanine neither interfere with the “correct” packing of side chains in the interior of the molecule nor introduce
stereochemical constraints that alter the interactions that lead to the correct structure of the unmodified sequence. Polyalanylated ribonuclease bears the same number of positive charges as the original native protein on which the chains were grown; other modifying groups that confer a negative charge, or that substitute a neutral for a
positive charge, were also attached to the eamino groups; the re-
sulting products were, again, capable of reversible refolding (Epstein
et al., 1963). The X-ray structures of homologous proteins also show that many
of the amino acid substitutions occur on the surface (Perutz e t al.,

1965). In fact, hairpin turns, which generally occur on the surface, are often sites of insertions or deletions of amino acids; such modifications are very easily accommodated on the surface, but the new sequence must preserve the tendency toward formation of the required turn (Light, 1974; Warme et al., 1974).
The early studies of Perutz and his colleagues, and the flood of new sequence and crystallographic data are generally consistent with the idea that mutations leading to replacement of nonpolar by polar residues are not permissible when they occur in the internal, more nonpolar portion of the folded m ~ l e c u l e . ~
Occasionally, double mutations occur in which biological function is first lost and then regained. Examples of this arise in the work of Yanofsky and his colleagues (Helinski and Yanofsky, 1963), who isolated a number of mutants of Escherichia coli that produce inactive tryptophan synthetase. In these species, point mutations have led to the synthesis of tryptophan synthetase molecules in which a single amino acid replacement has dictated an altered three-dimen-
’Lee and Richards (1971) have shown that the side chains in lysozyme, ribonu-
clease, and myoglobin that are accessible to solvent molecules are contributed by nonpolar and polar amino acids to the extent of approximately 45% and 55%, respectively. Thus, the generalization that the “inside” of a globular protein molecule in solution is mainly nonpolar, and the “outside” polar, may be an oversimplification. They suggest that assignment ofamino acid side chains to “buried” and “exposed” categories is of questionable value in attempts at empirical structure prediction.

sional structure (indicated by the fact that the mutant enzyme does not react with antibodies against the native enzyme) lacking biological activity. Second-site mutants, which produce active enzyme, were then isolated. This regain of function is achieved by introducing a second amino acid replacement such that the side chains of the two new amino acids presumably interact in a way similar to that of the original residues to preserve the three-dimensional structure, and hence biological activity, of the native enzyme. The lesion introduced by the initial mutation has thus been “cured” by the second one.
The kinds of alterations that can be made in the amino acid sequence without loss of folding capacity varies greatly from protein to protein, and it is not possible at present to suggest general rules. For example, removal of the NH,-terminal 20 residues of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (Fig. 4)produces RNase-S-protein (Richards, 1958)which is an intrinsically unstable structure lacking, in its reduced form, the interactions necessary to determine the threedimensional arrangement of its chain or the pairing of its 8 half-cys-

tine residues in disulfide linkage. Conditions favorable for disulfide interchange lead to “scrambling” of the disulfide pairing, and restoration of the native pairing of SH groups and the normal threedimensional structure takes place only when the S-peptide is added to the solution (Kato and Anfinsen, 1969b). In the experiments sum-
marized in Fig. 5, S-protein was exposed, at zero time, to an enzyme
isolated from microsomal membranes that catalyzes disulfide interchange (Goldberger et d.,1963; Venetianer and Straub, 1963; De
Lorenzo et al., 1966; Fuchs et al., 1967). In such a system, the free
energy can be lowered by the interchange among disulfide bonds to form a scrambled set; the enzyme catalyzes interchange between alternative disulfide pairings but, since there is presumably no uniquely stable set of SS bonds on the basis of the interactions among
the amino acid sequence in the truncated ribonuclease chain, only a chaotic mixture of isomers results. When the interactions for correct SS pairing and for the determination of the entire enzyme structure are restored by the addition of the S-peptide portion, the catalyzed disulfide interchange leads to the thermodynamically most stable structure with its proper pairing of sulfhydryl groups.

In contrast to the case of RNase-S, five amino acid residues may be removed from the NH,-terminus of staphylococcal nuclease (Bohnert and Taniuchi, 1972; Cone et al., 1971) (Fig. 6) without loss of either activity or, on the basis of a variety of physical measurements, of its three-dimensional conformation. This derivative is capable of un-
dergoing completely reversible denaturation (Taniuchi et a1., 1967;
Taniuchi and Anfinsen, 1968). Three additional residues, numbers 6, 7, and 8, are probably also dispensable, as suggested by the
studies on semisynthetic nuclease (Ontjes and Anfinsen, 1969) discussed in Section V.
Removal of a tetrapeptide sequence from the COOH-terminus of pancreatic ribonuclease by pepsin digestion (Anfinsen, 1956) pro-
duces a derivative which is enzymically inactive (pepsin-inactivated ribonuclease, PIR), and addition of the removed peptide does not restore activity (as it does when RNase-S-peptide is added to RNaseS-protein). Inspection of the molecular structure (Kartha et al., 1967;Wyckoff et al., 1970)of ribonuclease shows clearly that RNaseS-peptide, whose partial helical character exists only at low temperature when alone in solution (Klee, 1968; Brown and Klee, 1969,
1971; Silverman et al., 1972), can assume its partially helical charac-
ter and bind tightly to the RNase-S-protein moiety through a number

of side-chain interactions, even though the 20-21 peptide bond is not re-formed. The COOH-terminal tetrapeptide fragment, however, is
apparently too small to interact with a large enough binding energy to provide the additional interactions necessary for determination of the stable structure of RNase (although, as we shall discuss in Section 111, complementation with a longer COOH-terminal fragment of 14 residues will regenerate an active structure). Reduced PIR cannot be reoxidized to yield the correct half-cystine pairs, and conditions of disulfide interchange cause randomization of the native pairing (Taniuchi, 1970).
An example of a protein that does not arise spontaneously from its reduced form-that is, that appears to be the metastable product of a stable precursor- is the naturally occurring hormone, insulin. Experience with the disulfide interchange enzyme had suggested that it possessed the capacity to “probe” protein structures for stability of particular arrangements of SS bonds, and for whether the pairing of half-cystine residues was specifically determined by the covalent structure of the polypeptide chains (Givol et al., 1965). Addition of this enzyme in its reduced (SH) form to insulin catalyzed a rapid disulfide interchange, and a mixture of randomly cross-linked A and B chains precipitated.
After the isolation of proinsulin (Fig. 7) by Steiner (1967) and his colleagues and the determination of the sequences of proinsulins from several species (e.g., Chance et al., 1968), it became clear that the correct three SS bonds in insulin are determined by the intact single-chain structure of the precursor molecule, and that cleavage at two points to yield the commonly observed insulin structure occurs after initial formation and storage of this substance; that is, proin-
sulin is a thermodynamically stable molecule (with respect to the reduced one), but insulin is not. In this respect, the proinsulininsulin system resembles other zymogen systems found in the pan-
creas -for example, chymotrypsinogen, which can refold and form correct SS bonds after prior reduction, and chymotrypsin, which cannot (Givol et al., 1965).
While the experiments on ribonuclease S discussed above and on staphylococcal nuclease discussed in Section I11 indicate that several fragments can associate in the refolding process, in general the folding process is more easily accomplished if it is an intramolecular one. Intramolecular folding must work against conformational en-
tropy. However, folding which involves intermolecular interaction between two or more fragments must, in addition, work against a loss of translational and rotational entropy, and will thus be difficult

unless accompanied by strong specific association between the fragments as occurs in the cases of ribonuclease S and staphylococcal nuclease. This is presumably the reason why the three cyanogenbromide peptide fragments of myoglobin do not regain the native conformation easily when mixed together (Epand and Scheraga, 1968);also, perhaps the charged end groups, which are removed further from the site of binding when longer, overlapping peptides are used, interfere with the folding of myoglobin.
In some cases, either or both of the fragments in a complementing pair derived by proteolytic digestion of a protein chain may be degraded without loss of the capacity to regenerate a biologically active complex. For example, RNase-S-peptide may be degraded with
carboxypeptidase A, with removal of 5 COOH-terminal residues,
without losing its ability to attach to, and activate, RNase-S-protein (Potts et al., 1963). A number of synthetic derivatives of RNase-Speptide, shortened at either or both the NH,- or COOH-termini, have been prepared; these are also able to produce active variants of
RNase-S (Hofmann et al., 1966; Scoffone et al., 1967).

On the other hand, the low yield of insulin regenerated from the two reduced, separated chains upon combination in solution under oxidizing conditions is a good example of the effect of extensive removal of amino acid residues from the structure of a protein molecule. The reduced chain of the insulin precursor, proinsulin, regenerates the native, disulfide-cross-linked precursor in high yield (Steiner, 1967).
Additional insight into the spontaneous folding of proteins is provided by a consideration of the energetics of the polypeptide chain. Conformational energy calculations, discussed in Section VIII, suggest that the interactions among the various portions of the chain (primarily local interactions, but also medium- and long-range ones) contribute in dictating the three-dimensional structure that the polypeptide will adopt in a given solvent. Two sources of entropy also contribute; these are the solvation entropy (contributing to a preference for nonpolar groups to be in the interior and for polar groups to be on the surface of a protein in water) and the conformational entropy, the latter arising from fluctuations around the native conformation (primarily from vibrations around single bonds). The large conformational entropy characteristic of the denatured form can be reduced by the introduction of disulfide cross-links, thereby stabilizing the native structure relative to the denatured form (see Section IV). Ligands can also stabilize native proteins, despite a loss of conformational entropy, by providing binding energy (see Section IV).
111. In Vitro COMPLEMENTATIOONF PROTEINFRAGMENTS
Experiments on ribonuclease S, involving association of two complementary peptide fragments to form a biologically active enzyme, have been discussed in Section 11. In this section we shall describe similar results with staphylococcal nuclease and with other derivatives of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease. These experiments help to delineate those parts of polypeptide chains that provide the interactions required for folding to yield a functional three-dimensional structure.
From crystallographic studies, it appears that certain residues may not be crucial for maintaining a native structure. Thus, looseness of the chain in the neighborhood of residues on either side of residues 19-21 of ribonuclease-S is indicated by the poor resolution of these residues in electron density maps (Wyckoff et al., 1970). Similarly, the NH,- and COOH-terminal portions of the sequence of staphylococcal nuclease, which are not visible on the electron density map (Arnone et al., 1971),are probably not important for structural stabili-

zation. This conclusion is also reached on the basis of synthetic studies in which residues 1-8 (Ontjes and Anfinsen, 1969) and
141-149 (Parikh et al., 1971) have been omitted from semisynthetic nuclease (see Section V), with retention of significant activity, and the physical properties of the native enzyme.
The overall geometric features of staphylococcal nuclease are summarized in Fig. 8. This stereoscopic representation of the polypeptide backbone is based on the coordinates of the a-carbon atoms of each amino acid in the chain (Amone e t al., 1971). Nuclease may be cleaved (Taniuchi et al., 1967; Taniuchi and Anfinsen, 1968) with trypsin in the presence of calcium ions and a tightly bound competitive inhibitor, 3‘,5’-thymidine diphosphate (pdTp), to yield complementing fragments (Figs. 8 and 9). Residues 1 through 5 are first rapidly cleaved off to yield nuclease-(6-149), which has the same specific activity and general physicochemical behavior as native nuclease. The bonds between residues 48 and 49 or 49 and 50 in the sequence -Pro-Lys-Lys-Gly- (residues 47-50) are then cleaved somewhat more slowly to yield two fragments which interact noncovalently to form a stable complex called nuclease-T. When cleavage occurs between 49 and 50, residue 49 is subsequently removed from the (6-49) fragment by the further action of trypsin. The final complex consists of two species: nuclease-T-(6-48) combined with either nuclease-T-(49-149) or nuclease-T-(50-149), In the presence of calcium ions, both of these complexes exhibit enzyme activity-about 8-10% that of the native enzyme. Nuclease-T possesses a helix content, as indicated by its circular dichroism or optical rotatory dispersion properties, which is approximately 80% that

of native nuclease (ca. 18%of the chain) and exhibits the same ultraviolet spectral anomalies in the tyrosine region. Its tryptophan residue is similarly buried in a nonpolar environment as judged by measurements of the fluorescence emission spectrum upon activation with light at 295 nm. The nuclease-T complex consisting of residues (6-48) and (49-149) has been crystallized in the presence of calcium ions and pdTp and is isomorphous with similarly liganded native nuclease (Taniuchi et al., 1972).
Several other sets of complementing fragments of staphylococcal nuclease have been studied (Taniuchi and Anfinsen, 1971). Figure 10 gives a schematic summary of these fragments in terms of their origins within the sequence of the native chain of 149 residues. The three helical regions in nuclease are located in the (49-149) fragment, discussed above as part of nuclease-T, and antiparallel pleated sheet structures are located between residues 12-35 and (not indicated in Fig. 10) approximately 73-95.
If nuclease is trifluoroacetylated (TFA), brief trypsin digestion yields a derivative, from which the TFA groups may be removed under mild conditions, consisting of residues 1-126 (Taniuchi and Anfinsen, 1969). This material is essentially inactive5 and struc-
Even after exhaustive purification by ion exchange and affinity chromatography, fragment (1-126) shows about 0.12%of the activity of native nuclease. This activity is intrinsic to the molecule (Sachs et al., 1974) and not d u e to persistent contamination with native enzyme. This is demonstrated by the fact that an immunoglobulin fraction, isolated from antinuclease antiserum, which is specific for the antigenic determinant supplied by the fragment (127-149), inactivates native nuclease but has no effect on the slight activity associated with (1-126).

tureless as judged by hydrodynamic and spectral measurements, and is not activated, or folded, by the addition of the (127-149) fragment which has been removed. In terms of the interactions required for folding, this latter behavior is analogous to that of the mixture of the tetrapeptide, containing residues 121-124 of pancreatic ribonu-
clease, with des-(121-124)-ribonuclease (PIR) which is also inactive
and structurally unstable (Anfinsen, 1956). However, (1-126) may be activated by the addition of the peptide, (49-149), or of a fragment produced by CNBr digestion of native nuclease, containing residues (99-149). In Fig. 11, A and B, fragment (1-126) is shown in two roles, first donating the (6-48) portion of the nuclease sequence to complement (49-149) to produce a nuclease-T-like structure and,
second, furnishing the interactions required for complementation with the COOH-terminal portion of (49-149) to yield a stable nucleaselike structure. The activities of the complexes shown in Fig. 11A
and 11B, which are sufficiently stable to permit their isolation on phosphocellulose columns, are approximately 8% and 15%, respectively, that of the native enzyme.
As mentioned above, the addition of calcium ions and pdTp stabilizes the nuclease structure against trypsin cleavage except at certain specific peptide bonds that are present in accessible portions of the three-dimensional structure. If these ligands are added together with trypsin to a freshly prepared equimolar mixture of (1-126) and (49-149), presumably containing both of the complementation complexes shown in Fig. 11,the protease “clips” off the redundant portions of the sequence (Taniuchi and Anfinsen, 1969). After digestion, the fragment (6-48) is left from (1-126), and the fragment

(111-149) from (49-149). These two new fragments are produced in approximately equal amounts, indicating that the initial formation of the two kinds of complementing structures in Fig. 11A and B occurs to about the same extent. With longer preincubation of the mixture
+ + of (1-126) and (49-149) before trypsin addition, the ratio of the
complex [(6-48) (49-149)] to [(l-126) (111-149)] becomes about 2:1, indicating the greater thermodynamic stability of the former pair of fragments (Taniuchi and Bohnert, 1973).
The complementing system involving (1-126) and (99-149) is of interest in connection with the ability of fragments of protein chains to form stable, cooperative structures, such as helices. As in the experiments just described, careful trypsin digestion of this complex in the presence of calcium ions and pdTp removed a number of the redundant residues to yield a “trimmed” derivative containing (1-126) and (111-149) (Taniuchi and Anfinsen, 1971). Residues 99-106 form one of the three helical regions in native nuclease. Since residues 99-110 were removed from (99-149), they were presumably not involved in long-range interactions that might have hindered proteolytic digestion of the complex. Furthermore, the helix-

226

C. B . ANFINSEN AND H. A. SCHERAGA

forming residues, 99-106, are at the NH,-terminus of the (99-149) component and, as suggested a number of years ago by Schellman (1955), would have the incomplete hydrogen bonding arrangement characteristic of the end of a chain. The helical section in the complex must therefore be contributed by (1-126) and must be stabilized by long-range interactions.
One may ask how extensively a polypeptide chain may be cleaved and still retain, in its fragments, the capacity for complementation.
Recent experiments by Andria et al. (1971) on staphylococcal nuclease and by Lin et aZ. (1970) and Gutte et aZ. (1972) on bovine pancreatic ribonuclease have shown that even three fragments can
complement effectively to yield biologically active complexes, provided that the fragments are large enough to provide enough interaction energy to overcome the loss of translational and rotational entropy, and to stabilize nucleation sites; long fragments may also be required to avoid end effects of charged groups. The former group prepared the fragments (6-48), (49-126), and (99-149) and demonstrated that these bind to one another, in an equimolar amount, to form a complex with low but significant nuclease activity. The complex bound to an agarose-pdTp affinity column in the presence of calcium ions, but not in the absence of this metal ion. When any two of the three components of the complex were passed through such a column, no binding took place.
Lin and his colleagues showed that the ternary complex of RNaseS-peptide (residues 1-20 of ribonuclease), des-(121-124)-RNase-Sprotein and a synthetic peptide containing residues 111-124 of the protein exhibited approximately 30%of the activity of the native enzyme. The intact disulfide bonds in the largest component of this complex may be responsible for its surprisingly high stability and activity. In the various derivatives of the disulfide bond-free staphylococcal nuclease, activity and stability to heat decrease markedly as one goes from the single-chain native nuclease to the double-chain nuclease-T or the three-component structure described above.
To summarize, a polypeptide sequence can frequently be shortened, cleaved into fragments, and otherwise manipulated without destroying the interactions required for proper folding, Furthermore, experiments such as those just described (see Fig. 11) indicate that the three-dimensional native structure of a protein, inferred from the presence of biological activity, can be attained in
more than one way. The eliminated or modified portions in these experiments may be essential in the living cell (one might expect that natural selection would otherwise have gotten rid of them by

now), but may be redundant or superfluous in vitro. The experimental determination of the minimum portion of the chain required to form a nativelike structure may help to simplify the ultimate calculation of the three-dimensional structure from amino acid sequence data alone. However, from the fact that less than 100% activity is sometimes attained in the complementation experiments, it appears that the portions that have been removed probably provide significant long-range interactions, required to stabilize a f u l l y active enzyme.
IV. FLEXIBILITOYF PROTEINSIN SOLUTION: EFFECTOF CROSS-LINKASND LIGANDS
A native globular protein molecule in solution is not a static entity, but rather one which undergoes conformational fluctuations about its most stable conformation. These fluctuations arise primarily from the ease of rotation about the single bonds of the backbone and side chains of the protein molecule. It has, of course, been known for many years that globular proteins are denatured when exposed to extremes of pH or to urea or guanidine (see Anson and Mirsky, 1934a,b). The significance of this phenomenon in terms of conformational fluctuations was not appreciated since proteins were treated as essentially rigid bodies. However, the demonstration that proteins could swell in appropriate solvents implied that some degree of hindered rotation about single bonds, manifesting itself in conformational flexibility, was possible. Early evidence for such flexibility was obtained from light scattering (Doty and Katz, 1950) and hydrodynamic data (Scheraga and Mandelkern, 1953),which showed that a globular protein molecule could swell in the presence of certain additives, such as urea.
The internal rotations about single bonds should lead to conformational fluctuations, which constitute a conformational entropy contribution to the free energy, and hence should increase the stability of the average native conformation of a protein (Go and Scheraga, 1969) compared to what it would be if the native protein were rigid.
One form of direct evidence for conformational fluctuations comes from hydrogen-exchange experiments. The exchangeable hydrogens of a protein have been observed to fall into several classes on the basis of their rates of exchange, viz., those with rapid or instantaneous rates, intermediate rates, and very slow rates (Hvidt and Linderstr#m-Lang, 1954; Hvidt and Nielsen, 1966). The rate of exchange depends on many factors including interactions involving hydrogens, and those which shield hydrogens from the solvent.

228

C. B. ANFINSEN AND H. A. SCHERAGA

Since the extent of interaction or shielding may fluctuate as the conformation fluctuates, the rate of exchange will thus be influenced also by the flexibility of the protein molecule; however, it will usually be difficult to discriminate between flexibility of the mole-
cule and a range of accessibilities of its protons. Flexibility can be considerably influenced by covalent cross-links
and by noncovalently bound ligands. Let us consider first the case of noncovalent ligand binding. If the apoprotein is in equilibrium
with partially unfolded forms, the totality of which makes the protein appear to be flexible, the binding of a ligand will shift the equilibrium in favor of a single form. Thus, flexibility is reduced but, despite this loss of conformational entropy, the protein is stabilized in essentially one conformation because of the binding energy between the ligand and the protein. For example, the conformational flexibility of apomyoglobin is reduced by complexing with a heme group, that of staphylococcal nuclease by complexing with calcium ion and pdTp, and that of pancreatic ribonuclease by complexing with an anion, such as a phosphate ion. The effects of such ligands are shown in Figs. 12 and 13 for staphylococcal nuclease and myoglobin, respectively. In the absence of ligands, both proteins (in which all exchangeable hydrogens had previously been replaced by tritium) lost most of the tritium atoms at pH 7-8 at an extremely
rapid rate (Schechter et al., 1969), indicating that the structures were
quite flexible. In the presence of the ligands, hematin or Ca2+and
pdTp, the flexibility was reduced to such an extent that, in myoglobin and staphylococcal nuclease, respectively, 25 and 34 tritium atoms became essentially nonexchangeable even after many hours in aqueous solution. Presumably, the rapidly exchanging tritium atoms are near the “outside” of the protein, while the slowly exchanging ones are on the “inside.”
In contrast to ligand binding, covalent cross-links, such as disulfide bonds, which appear in specific sites in a globular protein, stabilize the protein against denaturation because such cross-links lower the entropy of the denatured or random-coil form of the protein. A randomly coiled chain has considerable entropy, and the effect of cross-links on its entropy depends on how the cross-links are introduced. The cross-links can be introduced either at random in the random coil or, alternatively, by ordering the chains, crosslinking the ordered system, and then melting it to obtain a crosslinked random coil. These two types of random coil differ in entropy, the latter having a lower entropy than the former. For the former, the entropy is essentially unaffected since the entropy loss

from the restriction of chain mobility by the cross-links is compensated by an entropy gain from the random placement of cross-links. However, if the cross-linking is carried out in the ordered state, the resulting random coil exhibits only the entropy loss from the restriction of chain mobility; for this case, Flory (1956) has shown how the entropy loss of the random coil depends on the number of cross-links (introduced in the ordered state), and thus has provided a quantitative basis for the well-known observation (Kauzmann, 19.5913) that protein stability increases as the number of disulfide bonds increases. For example, if one cross-link occurs at every 28 residues, Flory’s (1956) theory leads to a decrease of 8.5 EU for the denatured form (Scheraga, 1963).

ordered is racked rubber (Roberts and Mandelkern, 1958); this is rubber which is rendered fibrous by stretching and cross-linking while in the stretched state. Roberts and Mandelkern (1958) showed that such cross-linked racked rubber undergoes a phase transition, the melting properties depending on the degree of crosslinking, according to Flory’s (1956)predictions. Disulfide bonds of native proteins, being in specific sites, are the analogs of the crosslinks that are introduced into rubber when it is in the stretched (ordered) state. Thus, disulfide bonds serve a primary role in reducing conformational fluctuations in the denatured form, thereby stabilizing native proteins relative to denatured ones. Disulfide bonds also reduce conformational fluctuations in the native protein, but the larger effect is their influence on the entropy of the denatured form.
In summary, native apoproteins have some degree of flexibility
which can be reduced by ligand binding. In some proteins, the conformational fluctuations are reduced by using disulfide bonds in specific locations to destabilize the denatured form relative to the native
form.
v. SYNTHETIC ANALOGSOF PROTEINS
In Section 11, we discussed the effect of variations in amino acid sequence on the three-dimensional structure when these variations occur as a result of mutations (e.g., the various hemoglobins), or as
compensatory double mutations (e.g., tryptophan synthetase), or are observable in proteins that have homologous sequences (e.g., chymotrypsin and trypsin). Such variations in sequence provide informa-
tion as to which portions of the polypeptide chain are essential for
biological activity and, therefore, presumably for achieving the particular three-dimensional structure.
Unfortunately, natural mutations can provide only a limited number of altered proteins for study. This is because a large fraction of the mutations that can occur in a particular gene are lethal if the
protein concerned is an essential one for the physiology of the cell. Furthermore, mutations might cause such severe changes in the in-
teractions involved in the amino acid sequence that an unrecognizable protein might result that could not be isolated for study. For these reasons, recent developments in the field of peptide chain synthesis become of great importance in the production of chemical “mutants” in which the organic chemist can deliberately introduce an alteration in the sequence.
Development of new side-chain protecting groups and coupling procedures have made it possible to synthesize quite long peptide

chains, even with the ‘‘classical” techniques of peptide synthesis in solution. Such methods have been used for the synthesis of numerous analogs of RNase-S-peptide (Hofmann et al., 1966; Scoffone et al., 1967). Complete syntheses have also been carried out for insulin (Yu-Cang et al., 1961; Jiang et al., 1963; Katsoyannis et al., 1963,1964; Meienhofer et al., 1963; Zahn et al., 1964; Ching-I. et al., 1964),adrenocorticotropic hormone (Schwyzer and Sieber, 1963), mellitin (Wiinsch et al., 1968a,b), vasopressin (Katsoyannis et al., 1957), and oxytocin (du Vigneaud et al., 1954). The entire glucagon molecule (Wiinsch et al., 1968a,b) as well as thyrocalcitonin (Guttmann et al., 1971) and secretin (Bodanszky and Williams, 1967; Bodanszky et al., 1967)have also recently been synthesized by these
careful stepwise procedures. These molecules are of such a length that the synthesis of analogs might be realistically undertaken using
the traditional methods of coupling and purification. Except for
insulin, it is not yet known whether the polypeptides listed, all hor-
mones with the exception of RNase-S-peptide, form unique ordered three-dimensional structures in aqueous solution in the absence of their receptors; thus, correlations of amino acid sequence with three-
dimensional structure cannot be made. Since synthetic protein chains should presumably be capable of
folding to the native structure, analogs of such chains could, in prin-
ciple, be produced that would give useful information on the alterations that are permissible and those that are not. However, only in the case of RNase-S-protein, having 104 amino acid residues, has an essentially classical, stepwise synthesis been achieved (Hirschmann, 1971),and the difficulty of the task makes synthesis of further analogs a major undertaking. For this reason, the development of the solid phase method by Merrifield and his colleagues (Merrifield, 1965)has introduced new optimism into this field of research. The method is still far from perfect, suffering from an unpredictable incompleteness of coupling at many steps and from side reactions that may be introduced during deprotection and removal from the resin ’ support. Nevertheless, in cases where products could be purified by “functional’’ purification, a number of relatively homogeneous polypeptides have been made which exhibited activity and physical prop-
erties quite similar to those of the native molecule. Gutte and Merrifield (1969), for example, prepared totally synthetic ribonuclease which, after being allowed to fold into its three-dimensional form with the attendant purification resulting from the restrictions imposed by the pairing of half-cystine residues, was further purified by digestion with trypsin; that is, the molecules with incorrect amino

acid sequences were digested with trypsin, whereas native ribonuclease is resistant to tryptic digestion. The final material showed a specific activity of 80% that of native enzyme. Even with this success, however, the effort involved in the synthesis of analogs would still be very great, and no such synthetic “mutants” have yet been made.
Greater synthetic flexibility is afforded by peptides of somewhat more modest size than RNase. As mentioned above, RNase-S-peptide has been extensively studied by the amino acid replacement approach, using traditional peptide synthesis, and many of the sidechain interactions that are responsible for productive interaction with RNase-S-protein have thus been established. Stepwise coupling in solution begins to be less applicable when polypeptides reach 30 residues in length, or thereabouts, owing in large part to the great insolubility that develops with peptides of this size and to the slowness of coupling reactions. The synthesis of a large variety of fragments of staphylococcal nuclease, ranging from about 30 up to 43 residues in length, has been attacked using the solid phase method since the products could be “functionally” purified by complementation with a natural fragment (Ontjes and Anfinsen, 1969; Kato and Anfinsen, 1969a). For example, the complex formed between synthetic fragment (6-47) and natural (49-149) can be purified essentially to complete identity with natural nuclease-T by digestion with trypsin in the presence of the stabilizing ligands, calcium ions, and pdTp (Chaiken, 1971). The capacity of such synthetic fragments to produce activity when added to the complementing natural fragment could also be greatly enhanced by adsorption on, and subsequent elution from, an affinity chromatography column of agarose to which the natural fragment had been attached. In this way, a number of analogs of (6-47) were purified b y passage through agarose-(49-149) columns (Ontjes and Anfinsen, 1969). Such experiments lead successfully to purification only when the synthetic fragment complements the immobilized, natural portion of the protein.
Synthetic analogs of nuclease-T have been prepared for two reasons, first as a means of gaining some understanding of the sidechain functional groups that are involved in substrate or inhibitor binding and in the actual catalytic process of phosphodiester cleavage, and second to study the interactions between different parts of the protein that help stabilize the native structure. As illustrated in Fig. 14, the various critical dicarboxylic amino acids (one of the four, aspartic acid residue 19, is not shown in this figure), suggested by crystallographic analysis to be involved in calcium binding, were

The symbols B and N B indicate whether the synthetic 6-47 analog was or was not bound to nuclease-T-(49-149).

replaced by the corresponding amide or by a residue with a longer or shorter side chain (Chaiken and Anfinsen, 1971). In all cases but one (aspartic acid residue 40,where substitution with asparagine still left some residual activity), such changes in charge or chain length resulted in total loss of activity in the complex formed by complementation with (49-149) isolated from the native enzyme, In experiments on the importance of the guanido group at position 35,substitution of arginine with lysine led to inactivation. All the analogs of (6-47) shown in Fig. 14 were capable of binding to the larger fragment except for those containing citrulline at position 35 and asparagine at position 21. Thus, in spite of loss of function, the modified fragments could furnish the interactions required to attain the three-dimensional structure of nuclease, or at least most of its characteristic solution properties. Only a direct crystallographic comparison (now in progress by H. Taniuchi and his colleagues) of native nuclease-T and the active or inactive semisynthetic complexes will permit the required quantitative evaluation as to how close these structures are to the native one. At the moment, the extent of similarity to authentic nuclease-T rests on indirect tests such as measure-

ment of the degree of fluorescence emission shown by tryptophan residue 140, which is greatly enhanced when this residue is buried in the hydrophobic pocket formed upon the folding of the nuclease
chain (Figs. 15 and 16). The stability of complexes may also be estimated by optical rotatory measurements and by the resistance of
the complexes to trypsin digestion in the presence of stabilizing
ligands. An example of the usefulness of synthesis in the investigation of
the principles of folding and function is afforded by a comparison of the complex containing synthetic (6-44) and natural (49-149) with that in which the first fragment has been replaced with (6-43) or with an analog of (6-44) having an alanine residue in the COOH-terminal

position rather than the naturally occurring threonine (Sanchez et al.,
1973). The complex with (6-44), whose activity is the same as that of the complex containing (6-47), is stable to trypsin in the presence of ligands and shows native-type optical and fluorescence properties. Replacement of threonine with alanine causes no significant change in any of these properties. However, when glutamic acid 43 (see Figs, 6 and 14) is made the COOH-terminal residue, activity is essentially completely destroyed. The complex formed shows somewhat less stability than that of the (6-44) complex, but it is clear that a native-type complex does form since trypsin digestion is much more rapid when the stabilizing ligands are omitted. Thus, even this considerably modified and inactive analog of nuclease can supply the proper interactions required for the formation of a macromolecule bearing a unique binding site for calcium and pdTp and possessing a remarkably high degree of stability in solution. Experiments of this type serve to identify the portions of the chain that are essential for folding to the native conformation.

VI. FOLDINGOF FIBROUPSROTEINS
As indicated in the Introduction, some globular proteins exist as single-chain units, whereas others form multisubunit aggregates. Fibrous proteins, such as myosin, fibrin, keratin, collagen, generally are most stable in aggregated forms; that is, their native conformations are determined by both intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. The possibility could exist that a thermodynamically stable state of a fibrous protein, such as collagen (in the form in which it is generally isolated for study), might be a mixture of many imperfectly matched aggregated chains, as is observed with doublestranded synthetic polynucleotides [see Poland and Scheraga (1970) for discussion of stability of such structures]. If perfectly matched structures are to be attained, a large set of specific interactions are required, For example, the newly synthesized chains could be properly aligned by connecting covalent bonds, and the connecting segment be then removed by proteolysis. If such a mechanism were operative, the resulting molecule might not be thermodynamically stable with respect to unaggregated chains. Unfortunately, except for collagen, very little is known about these additional interactions or the mechanisms that lead to perfect matching in the formation of fibrous structures.
When the myosin “molecule” [now known to consist of two long polypeptide chains (Slayter and Lowey, 1967; Godfrey and Harrington, 1970) together with smaller chains (Dreizen et d., 1967; Weeds, 1969) which must be present for ATPase activity in the
myosin complex] is completely dissociated in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride solution, removal of the denaturing agent by dialysis at neu-
tral pH leads to the regeneration of an entity having the hydrodynamic properties of the original myosin (Godfrey and Harrington, 1970). Enzyme activity is not recovered, possibly because of lack of proper incorporation of the smaller “light” chains. No data are available on the kinetics of the regeneration process, either in uivo or in uitro, and hence a discussion of myosin folding is not possible at the present time.
The details of the formation of fibrin clots from thrombin-activated fibrinogen (i.e., fibrin monomer) are also obscure. Considerable information is available about the geometry of aggregation of fibrin monomer, during the early stages of the reaction, in which short rodlike oligomers are formed by staggered-overlapping (Krakow et
al., 1972) with a first-order rate of release of heat (Sturtevant et al.,
1955); similarly, there is considerable information about the struc-

238

C. B. ANFINSEN AND H. A. SCHERAGA

ture and properties of the end product, viz., the fibrin clot (Ferry and Morrison, 1947). However, there is relatively little information as to how the intermediate rodlike polymers proceed to the organized, periodic structures observed in electron micrographs of fibrin clots (Hall, 1949). For a recent review of fibrinogen and fibrin, see Doolittle (1973).
In the case of collagen, there is more information available about the formation of the native structure. The rate of refolding of denatured collagen in vitro is extremely slow compared to that of the globular proteins, particularly those free of disulfide bonds. Harrington and his colleagues have carried out an extensive and careful series of studies of the kinetics of the renaturation of single and cross-linked collagen chains which entail processes with half-times of many hours (Hauschka and Harrington, 1970a,b,c). These experi-
ments provide useful examples of the crystallization of long polypeptide chains during the folding process, but the times involved are much too long to permit any interpretation of collagen folding as it occurs in vivo. Experiments involving pulse-labeling of collagenproducing tissue cultures, much like the early Dintzis (1961) experiments on hemoglobin synthesis in reticulocytes, show that the overall time for the assembly of triple-stranded procollagen, including time required for numerous hydroxylation and glycosylation steps, is only about 6 minutes (Speakman, 1971; Vuust and Piez, 1972; Piez, 1972) (Fig. 17).
The slow in vitro rate is thought to be due to the mismatching of the amino acid triplets that constitute the backbones of the a1and a$ chains (a typical sequence would be -Gly-X-Y-Gly-Pro-Y-Gly-X-HypGly-Pro-Hyp-, where X and Y can be essentially any amino acid but where the occurrence of Gly at every third position is obligatory for the formation of the collagen fold). Using the long chains obtained by the denaturation of collagen, mismatching can be very severe. In shorter fragments of collagen such as the 36-residue peptide, al-CB2, isolated from digests of the a1chain, the third-order dependence on concentration inherent in triple helix formation can easily be shown (Piez and Sherman, 1970). Furthermore, any mismatching of the three short chains, leading to the formation of “out-of-phase” triple helices with unmatched ends, could be rearranged much more easily to yield the maximally cross-linked form with lowest conformational free energy.
The relatively short time required for collagen formation in vivo has been rationalized on the basis of the hypothesis summarized in Fig. 17 (e.g., Speakman, 1971)involving precursor chains (Layman et

al., 1971; Bellamy and Bornstein, 1971), especially designed to ensure that mismatching will not occur (much as proinsulin ensures the formation of the correct disulfide bonds in insulin prior to conversion, by proteolytic cleavage, from a single- to a double-stranded molecule). As illustrated schematically in Fig. 17, two pro-a, chains and one pro-a2 chain become organized into an “in-phase” set of three chains which then can rapidly take on the triple helical collagen characteristics without mismatching of the repeating pattern of

three amino acid residues in the backbones of the chains. Subsequent removal of the amino-terminal portions of the chains is then postulated to produce triple-stranded collagen monomers, which go on to form the more aggregated strands seen in connective tissue.
The collagen story is not yet complete. Two laboratories have discovered the presence, in fibroblast cultures, of a major component
that consists of hydroxylated procollagen chains held together by
disulfide bonds. The formation of these covalent cross linkages in the domain that is subsequently removed by proteolysis may be related to the mechanism for chain alignment which permits the relatively rapid synthesis and assembly of this complex macromolecular
material (Smith et al., 1972; Kenvar et al., 1972).
In summary, the assembly of fibrous protein structures, involving several peptide chains, is dictated thermodynamically by intermolecular, in addition to intramolecular interactions. The structure of each chain in the aggregate is different from what it would be in the absence of intermolecular interactions (Miller and Scheraga, 1975). In addition, if mismatching of chains is to be avoided, some additional chain portions (which may be removed later by proteolysis) are required for proper alignment by specific interactions. While we are not considering them in this review, proteins consisting of several subunits (such as hemoglobins) also acquire stable native structures as a result of intermolecular as well as intramolecular interaction. Another example, in which intermolecular interactions may help stabilize different structures than would be obtained solely from intramolecular interactions, comes from crystals of polyamino acids. Thus, isolated chains of poly-P-benzyl-L-aspartate are stable as a-helices in solution, but transform to o-helices when they acquire additional (intermolecular) interactions in a crystal
(McGuire et al., 1971).
VII. EXPERIMENTAALPPROACHESTO THE STUDY
OF CONFORMATION
Various techniques have been used to determine the pathway of folding of a protein and also to determine the extent to which fragments of a polypeptide chain (in water and in other solvents) adopt the conformation which they possess when they are parts of a native protein. These involve the use of NMR, CD, proteolytic digestion, and immunological methods. Even if there is a tendency for a particular fragment to adopt the conformation that it has in the native protein, one would still expect the fraction of the total population, in which the whole fragment is in the native or nearly native conforma-

PROTEIN FOLDING

tion in water, to be very small; thus, physicochemical methods that measure average properties over the whole population would be hard-pressed to detect small amounts of the native conformation. On the other hand, techniques that detect specific conformations provide this information more easily.
The problem may be stated in another way. The native protein consists of many segments (in their so-called “native formats”) which are stabilized by long-range interactions. The native protein may be envisaged as being in equilibrium with various unfolded forms (which are at extremely low concentrations under conditions where the protein is native). In those forms in which the long-range interactions do not exist, the various segments take on an ensemble of conformations. In these partially unfolded forms, there is still some tendency (on the basis of the short- and medium-range interactions, which are still present in each segment) for various segments to adopt the native format, even though the fraction of such folded molecules may be small. While the equilibrium position between such (separated) native formats and other (random) forms lies toward the random form, it does not take very much free energy (acquired from long-range interactions when the protein folds up; see part C of this

section) to shift these equilibria and thus stabilize the entire protein molecule in its native form. These ideas are represented schematically in Fig. 18, where (only for simplicity in illustration) the native protein (A) is shown to consist of two segments, each in its native format, The native protein is represented in equilibrium with a partially unfolded form (B) in which the two segments are in the native conformation; in the equilibrium between A and B (which presumably lies far in the direction of A), the long-range interactions
between native formats I and I1 are involved. In the additional reactions shown, the individual native formats (B) are in equilibrium with random forms (C). The equilibrium between B and C is thought to lie far in the direction of C. Whatever (small, but nontrivial) amount of B there is in equilibrium with C exists in the native format because of short- and medium-range interactions within the individual segments. However, the incremental free energy, acquired from long-range interactions in the equilibrium between A and B, provides the driving force to convert C to A, These equilibria can be studied with excised segments of the protein, with comple-
mentary protein fragments, and with the whole protein. With the scheme of Fig. 18 in mind, it is of interest to determine
the relative amounts of the various native formats which are present in form B, and to detect the actual equivalent of the schematic pathway C + B -+ A in the folding of a native protein.
A. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Approach to Folding
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy appears to have great potential for describing the detailed mechanism of protein folding. Resonances from many chemical groups in a protein may be resolved and identified, and thus information about the behavior of different parts of a protein may be obtained. So far, nuclear magnetic resonance experiments on protein folding have been limited primarily to equilibrium studies.
A number of years ago, McDonald and Phillips (1967),Cohen and Jardetzky (1968), and others demonstrated that high resolution NMR spectra of native and denatured proteins were sufficiently different so that structural information related to the folding process could be deduced. However, it was only after the imidazole resonances of ribonuclease (Bradbury and Scheraga, 1966; Meadows et al., 1968) and several aromatic and imidazole resonances of staphylococcal nuclease (Markley et al., 1968, 1970) were identified, and nuclease was selectively deuterated [by growing the staphylococci in cultures with deuterated amino acids, so as to simplify the downfield region

of the NMR spectra (Putter et al., 1969)], that detailed information about folding was obtained.
Jardetzky et al. (1971) studied the alkaline-induced unfolding of nuclease by measuring the values of the chemical shifts of histidine, tyrosine, and tryptophan residues as a function of pH. It was found that the curves for the pH-dependence of these chemical shifts were not superimposable, and this was interpreted to mean that different parts of the protein were unfolding at different pH values. An attempt was made to correlate these differences with specific parts of the nuclease molecule based on the identification that had been made of several resonances and on the high resolution X-ray structure (Arnone et al., 1971). Indeed a series of diagrams of the unfolding (or folding) process was produced on this basis. These diagrams tend to imply a set of kinetically distinguishable, relatively stable intermediates. This interpretation is open to some question on the following grounds: (a) the transition studied is not reversible, (b) when the conversion of native to denatured form is slow on the NMR time scale, chemical shift, without considering the areas of the individual resonance peaks, does not provide a measure of the extent of denaturation, (c) in addition, the chemical shift depends not only on the fraction of denatured form but also on differences in p K of the several histidine and tyrosine residues, and (d) the identification of many of the resonances was somewhat equivocal. Further, studies of the various fragments alone in solution (H. Taniuchi, unpublished data) suggest that certain of the postulated stable intermediates are unlikely to exist in significant concentrations. Despite these objections, the idea that NMR might be useful for detecting equilibrium intermediates in a folding transition was established by this study.
Epstein et al. (1971b) measured the areas of the four histidine resi-
dues during the reversible, cooperative, acid-induced transition of nuclease. They found that two histidine residues underwent a conformational transition which was exactly superimposable on spectral and hydrodynamic measurements of the low-pH transition. However, a third histidine residue exhibited a complex slow exchange process with a midpoint about 0.5 pH unit higher than the overall transition. The behavior of the fourth residue was not ascertainable. In an analogous study of the acid-heat denaturation of ribonuclease, Westmoreland and Matthews (1973) and Roberts and Benz (1973)
were also able to demonstrate equilibrium conformational intermediates.
Full application of the potential of NMR for describing the kinetics and mechanism of protein folding may be realized by recent ad-

vances in pulsed Fourier transform and flow technology for NMR (Sykes and Scott, 1972).

B . Proteolytic Digestion und Protein Unfolding
Many native proteins, particularly those in which conformational fluctuations are reduced by disulfide bonds or by ligands, are not attacked by such proteolytic enzymes as trypsin, a-chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase A. However, as the protein is unfolded reversibly by heating, e.g., ribonuclease (Hermans and Scheraga, 1961), successive peptide bonds become accessible to proteolytic attack (Mihalyi and Harrington, 1959; Ooi et al., 1963; Rupley and Scheraga, 1963; Scott and Scheraga, 1963; Ooi and Scheraga, 1964; Klee, 1967). The transition curves for the reversible thermal denaturation of ribonuclease are illustrated in Fig. 19, and its amino acid sequence in Fig. 4.
As the temperature is increased, the region of the ribonuclease molecule that first becomes susceptible to proteolytic attack is the peptide bond between Tyr-25 and Cys-26, which is hydrolyzed by achymotrypsin at 45” and pH 6.8 and pH 8.0 (Rupley and Scheraga, 1963; Klee, 1967). Trypsin does not hydrolyze ribonuclease until higher temperatures than a-chymotrypsin, and its first sites of attack are the Lys-31-Ser-32 and Arg-33-Asn-34 bonds (Ooi et al., 1963; Klee, 1967). Using data such as these, together with spectral and NMR data (Roberts and Benz, 1973),information about the importance of the C-terminal tetrapeptide for proper refolding of the protein during the formation of the disulfide bonds (Anfinsen, 1956), and the

X-ray structure of the native protein (Kartha et al., 1967; Wyckoff e t al., 1970), Burgess and Scheraga (1975b) proposed the pathway of
unfolding shown in Fig. 20. In this model, the C-terminus (being involved in internal interactions) unfolds relatively late in the transi-
tion. This aspect of the model for unfolding was confirmed by showing that the C-terminal valine residue becomes susceptible to attack by carboxypeptidase A relatively late in the thermal transition
(Burgess et al., 1975b). The diagram of Fig. 20 is not meant to imply that a single stable intermediate exists at the end of each stage of
unfolding. On the contrary, the pathway of unfolding (which is assumed to be the same as that for folding of the disulfide-bonded mole-
cules, in this reversible process) involves the existence of numerous species in equilibrium with each other at any given temperature. As the temperature changes, the distribution of species alters, and Fig. 20 is intended to represent the nature of the dominant species present at each temperature, on the pathway from the native to the denatured state.
Burgess and Scheraga (1975b) postulated that the scheme of Fig. 20 can be used to set up a model for the folding of the nascent chain without disulfide bonds. This does not necessarily imply that the steadystate concentration of these intermediates is high, but only that the folding proceeds through the sequence of events along this pathway; see the original paper for further discussion of this point. With this provision in mind, we see that part V of the diagram illustrates two initial nucleation sites for folding. In one site, there are two chain reversals at residues 36-39 and 91-94 which enable three extended
chains (the anti-parallel p pleated sheet between residues 81-87 and
96-102, and the chain between residues 40 and 48) to participate in long-range interactions. The other nucleation site (62-74) involves a nonregular conformation with a chain reversal at residues 65-68.
These nucleation sites (chain reversals and extended structures) arise from short- and medium-range interactions (Lewis et al., 1970,
1971; Ponnuswamy et al., 1973b; Burgess et al., 1974). Part IV of Fig. 20 shows that the N-terminal helix (which has a tendency to
form at residues 4-12 because of short-range interactions) then acquires stability from long-range interactions with one of the initial
extended-chain nucleation sites. Part I11 of Fig. 20 illustrates a simi-
lar phenomenon in which the C-terminal region could condense between the two nucleation sites (and “tie” them together), accompanied by a stabilization of the helix at residues 51-60. Subsequently, the helix at residues 25-33 might be stabilized at one of the nucleation sites, and the extended chain at residues 75-80 at the

other (see Part I1 of Fig. 20). Finally, the region of the chain between residues 17 and 25 would acquire its native conformation (Part I of Fig. 20), and the side chain of residue Tyr-92 would lose its mobility.
C . Immunological Approach to the Study of Conformation
The techniques described in Sections VI1,A and B provide information about the pathway of folding. In Sections VI1,C and D, we consider techniques designed primarily to study the conformation of fragments of native protein molecules, but which also can give information about the native protein.
The fraction of the molecular fragments that exist in the native format can be determined by an immunological method if there exists a convenient method for measuring the binding constant for the interaction between an antibody with the native protein and with an excised fragment thereof, or of directly measuring the competition between the native protein and the fragment for the antibody. Such a method is available for staphylococcal nuclease (Sachs e t al., 1972a,b,c) and for enzymes in general (Arnon, 1973) since many antibodies form inactive complexes with them. Radioactive labeling of antigens can also be used for quantitative studies of antigen-antibody interactions (Furie et ul., 1974a,b), because they allow the estimation of amounts of antigen-antibody complexes by precipitation with heterologous antiglobulins.
When goats are immunized with native nuclease, antibodies are produced in good yield and with high affinity. The portion of the
immunoglobulin fraction that is specific for nuclease may be isolated
by absorption on columns of agarose to which nuclease has been attached (Sachs et ul., 1972a,b,c). Many of the antibodies in this fraction are potent inhibitors of nuclease activity. Subfractions of the antibody population possessing specificity for limited regions of the native molecule may be isolated by further affinity chromatography of the antinuclease on columns to which peptide fragments of the enzyme have been attached. These subfractions are identified by the subscript N [e.g., anti-(99-149),], indicating a fraction of the total anti-native nuclease antibody which is bound by an agarose column bearing a portion of the sequence containing the indicated residues. If anti-(99-149), is further fractionated by passage through a column of agarose-(127-149), two subfractions anti-(127-149)N and anti-(99-126), are obtained. These form catalytically inactive, but soluble complexes with nuclease. The complexes of anti-(99-126), with nuclease contain one molecule each of antibody and enzyme, as

248

judged by ultracentrifugal analysis (Sachs et al., 1972a). Scatchard

analysis of the interaction of the anti-(99-126), antibody population

with nuclease shows that 50% of the antibody binds with an associa-

tion constant of about 109M-' and the other 50% binds with an asso-

ciation constant of lo7 M-l, at 25", pH 7.2, and ionic strength 0.17

(Sachs et al., 1972b). The experiments described below were car-

ried out with excess antibody, so that only the population with the

higher association constant was involved. The rate of association of

this antibody with its antigenic determinant is very rapid (with a

second-order rate constant of 4 x lo5 M-l sec-l) as determined by

analysis of the kinetics of inactivation, while the rate of dissociation

is very slow (with a rate constant of 5 x

sec-I) (Sachs et al.,

197213). These rates provide a basis for the method (described

below) used to estimate the concentration of the complex between

antibody and nuclease fragment.

Inactivating antibody fractions such as these may be used to es-

timate the percent of peptide fragments which exist in the native

format. The equilibrium involving the sequence (99-149), which

contains the determinant for the inactivating, but nonprecipitating,

antibody anti-(99-126),, may be visualized, schematically, as shown

insignificant (Sachs et al., 1972a). It is also assumed that the association constant of the antibody in question is the same for the sequence (99-126) as a free fragment in its native format and as a part of the native structure of nuclease. Hence we may combine Eqs. (2) and (4) to obtain
When the conformational equilibrium (Eq. 1) between the random and native-format forms of (99-149) lies far in the direction of the random form as indicated by physical chemical studies (Taniuchi and Anfinsen, 1969) showing that (99-149) is disordered when free in solution, under conditions that the whole protein is native, i.e., Kconf<< 1, the value of [(99-149)J is essentially the same as [tota1(99-149)],the total concentration of peptide. Therefore, Eq. (5) may be rewritten as
[anti-(99-126),(99 -149)NI KW”f = Ka,,[tota1(99-149)] [anti-(99-126),]
The value of K,,, has been found to be lo9M-I, as described above.
The value of [tota1(99-149)] is, of course, known from the amount of peptide used in the experiment. Thus, if [anti-(99-126),*(99-149),] and [anti-(99-126),], the equilibrium concentrations of bound and free antibody, respectively, can be determined experimentally, we can compute Kconf. The total amount of antibody [total anti-(99-126),] used in the experiment is known, and

Hence, if we can determine, say, [anti-(99-126),], w e will also know [anti-(99-126),-(99- ~ 9 ) ~ ] .
Sachs et al. (1972a) determined [anti-(99-126),] by a kinetic experiment, in which the inhibitory action of anti-(99-126), on the nuclease digestion of denatured DNA is measured, i.e., the enzymic reaction is

+ k
nuclease denatured DNA& products

(8)

where k, is the observed rate constant; this reaction can be followed
by observing the change in OD260as denatured DNA is digested. This reaction was run under conditions that are first order in nuclease and zero order in DNA (Le., the DNA is present in large excess). The reaction was studied in the presence of various amounts of anti-(99-126), and (99-149). Some of the total anti-(99-126)Ncombines with (99-149),, according to Eq. (3),and the rest remains free. The free antibody, anti-(99-126),, is available, then, to inhibit the Reaction, Eq. (8),because an inactive complex is formed as follows:

+ anti-(99-126), nuclease anti-(99-126),.nuclease

(9)

inactive

The experiment was carried out by incubating aliquots of the antibody with various amounts of the fragment in the assay mixture, containing the DNA, and then adding aliquots of nuclease after Reaction (3)had reached equilibrium. From the observed rate of enzymic attack of nuclease on DNA in the presence and in the absence of various levels of fragment, it was possible to determine the forward rate constant of Reaction (9) [expressed as a half-time, which is a
pseudo-first-order one because anti-(99-126), is present at much
higher concentration than nuclease] ,and hence the concentration of
free antibody [anti-(99-126),], as follows. Since Reaction (8) is first order in nuclease and zero order in DNA,
the concentration of hydrolytic products (expressed as AOD260, which is the difference in OD,,, at time t and that at the time that
nuclease is added) is

AOD,,, = k,t[nuclease]

(10)

The value of [nuclease] depends on that of [anti-(99-126),], which in
turn depends on that of (99-149), according to Eq. (3). Since the
backward rates in Eq. ( 3 )and Eq. (9)are small (k = 5 X sec-I), the
concentration of anti-(99-126), available for the (forward) associati'on of Reaction (9)can be assumed to be the equilibrium concentration in

PROTEIN FOLDING

251

the preincubation reaction of Eq. (3). Hence, the forward rate of Eq. (9) is

- d [nuclease] dt

= k, [anti-(99-126),]

*[nuclease]

(11)

where k, is the forwurd rate constant. Integration of Eq. ( 11)leads to

In[nuclease] = ln[nuclease], k2[anti-(99-126)Jt (12)

Substituting the value of [nuclease] from Eq. (10)into Eq. (12), we obtain

h(AOD,,,/t) = In(AOD,,,/t), - k2[anti-(99-126),]t

(13)

Thus, if data for OD,,, vs t are replotted according to Eq. (13),then the
slope gives the desired quantity, viz., k,[anti-(99-126),]. Experi-
ments were carried out at constant values of [total anti-(99-126),], but with increasing amounts of fragment, total(99-149).

PROTEIN FOLDING

From the data of Table 11, it can be seen that, for fragment (99-149), the native format (or at least those formats that are sufficiently similar to that of the native structure in this portion of the
total amino acid sequence to be recognized by the antibody) is present to the extent of approximately 0.02% of the total population. Such a fraction would be difficult to detect by existing physicochem-
ical methods (but see Section VII,D). The immunological approach almost certainly does not measure
the presence of fuZZy folded peptide fragments because the antibody might recognize an almost-native format. However, it seems likely
that many intramolecular interactions would be required to form and
stabilize a conformation that would be recognized by the highly specific antibody reagent and that would have a significant time of sur-
vival in solution. The small amount of folded form indicated by the
experiments summarized above emphasizes that a tendency to form the native structure exists (because of short- and medium-range interactions) but that the longer-range interactions are necessary for folding to the stable form.
It had been expected that similar studies on the equilibria between random and “native” forms of fragments longer than
(99-149) in which some of the longer-range interactions are present, might show greater proportions of the native conformation. However, the peptide (50-149), which is one of the two complementing fragments (see Section 111 on complementing fragments) that are produced upon trypsin digestion of nuclease in the presence of the ligands, calcium ions and pdTp, exhibits approximately the same degree of folding into “native format,” as judged by the immunological test described above, i.e., the value of Kconffor the equilibrium between the random and “native” forms of this peptide was
also about 2 x lop4.
A synthetic fragment containing residues 6 through 43 was available (Sanchez et al., 1973) which could substitute for the tryptic peptide (6-48) in the complementation with (50-149) to yield a semisynthetic nuclease-T analog. This complex was enzymically inactive, thus permitting the accurate estimation of the inhibition of activity of native nuclease by that portion of anti-(99-126), that was not bound by the complex, now presumably containing a higher percentage of molecules with the residues in the (99-126) sequence in their “native format.” The data shown in Table I1 illustrate the markedly increased folding of the (50-149) fragment that is induced and stabilized by the added fragment, because more, and possibly most, of the longer-range interactions are now available.

More recently, the immunological approach was used to determine
values of kconf of the native staphylococcal nuclease (Furie et al.,
1974b). Antibodies were prepared against the excised fragment of the sequence (residues 99-149), that contains the above-mentioned univalent antigenic determinant located between residues 99 and 126. In this population of antibodies, those that recognized the (99-126) portion of the total sequence as a free peptide in solution were isolated by affinity chromatography on a column of Sepharosenuclease6 and then on Sepharose-(1-126). This immunoglobulin fraction, which was not able to inactivate nuclease except at very high concentrations, was termed anti-(99-126)R(Furie et al., 1974a). Its specificity was presumably against one or more of the random forms of the sequence (99-126).
The anti-(99-126)R subpopulation produced a soluble complex with (99-149)R. The value of K,,, for the equilibrium

+ anti-(99-126), (99-149),, S anti-(99-126),.(99-149),,

(15)

was determined by labeling (99- 149)Rwith I4C-labeled carbamyl

groups at the NH,-terminus, and then precipitating anti-(99-

126)1t*(99-149)Rcomplexes with rabbit antibodies prepared against

goat y-globulins. The average values of K,,, at 25", pH 8.1, ionic
strength 0.17 were found to be lo7M-I for a high affinity population,

and 10' M-' for a lower-affinity population. Further, it was found

that nuclease at high concentrations could inhibit the reaction of

anti-(99-126)Rwith labeled (99-149)R. These observations were in-

terpreted by assuming the existence of the following equilibria:

= nuclease,, K ,111, nuclease, + anti-(99-126), nuclease, anti-(99-126),~1uclease,

(16) (17)

By an analysis analogous to that presented above, involving a study of the inhibition of Reaction (15)by nuclease, KConfor Reaction (16)
at 25", pH 8.1, ionic strength 0.17 was estimated to be 2900. This is on the basis of the concentration of native nuclease necessary to produce 50% inhibition of Reaction (15). This means that only 0.03%

'j Immunoabsorption of antibodies to columns of polypeptide antigens covalently bound to Sepharose can occur with antibodies to either the native or disordered antigen (Ab, or AbR). It is presumed that the large excess of antigen bound to Sepharose is in a conformational equilibrium so that both the native and disordered antigenic determinants are available for binding to antibody. Since all antibodies to fragment (99-149) might not be capable of cross-reacting with the unfolded form of nuclease (nuclease,) because some portions of the fragment occupy internal positions in the native protein, anti-(99-126), was first isolated b y immunoadsolption to columns of Sepharose-nuclease (Furie et al., 1974b).

PROTEIN FOLDING

255

of the staphylococcal nuclease molecules are sufficiently unfolded so

that the segment from residues 99 to 126 can be recognized by an-

tibodies having a high specificity for the unfolded form of this por-

tion of the protein sequence. Addition of the ligands, calcium ions

and pdTp, increased Kronfof Reaction (16) by more than 10-fold,

while an increase in temperature decreased the value of Kconf.

It is clear that the value of Kconb measured for nuclease, or for a

fragment thereof, pertains to that portion of the amino acid sequence

which is the antigenic determinant, not to the entire polypeptide.

Further, the conformational specificity of the antibodies, and the

simple equilibria [Reactions (1)and (16)] assumed for the antigens

are obviously approximations. However, because of the dominance

of short-range interactions and also [in the case of Reaction (16)] the

cooperativity of most protein folding processes, these are probably

good approximations. More importantly, the immunological method

provides a set of parameters that can be used for a quantitative

description of protein folding in a range of concentrations of native

format where it is difficult to apply other techniques.

Finally, it is of interest to consider the significance of a value of
Kconf= 2 X lop4for the 99-126 portion of fragment 99-149, i.e., for a

28-residue fragment, to see whether this is to be regarded as a small

or large number (assuming that 0.02% of the whole segment is na-

tive, and that the antibody interacts with the whole segment or, alter-

natively, with two or three residues far apart in the amino acid

sequence but requiring a fixed conformation of 28 residues to place

these two or three residues properly). As a very rough calculation,

assume that each amino acid residue of the fragment can exist in five

discrete backbone conformational states, each of which is accessible

with equal probability. Then there are 5" (or 10zOp)ossible confor-

mations of this fragment, of which the native conformation is only

one, Thus, if the native conformation were attained as a random
event, Kconfwould be lo-'". (If the antibody interacts only with, say,

10 residues rather than 28, then Kconrwould be lo-', on the same

basis.) When viewed in this light, it can be seen that 2 X

is a

very large number, arising from intramolecular interactions that

make the native conformation a very probable (nonrandom) one for

the excised fragment. A value of K,,,nf= 2 X

for Reaction (1)

corresponds to a standard free-energy change of -5 kcal at 300°K. In

order to increase Kconfto 104[i.e., to make the fragment become es-

sentially completely native, as observed in Reaction (16)], an addi-

tional 10 kcal would be required from long-range interactions, or

0.37 kcal per residue. It is reasonable to expect that an additional

256

C. B. ANFINSEN AND H. A. SCHERAGA

0.37 kcal per residue can be obtained from long-range interactions (when this fragment interacts with the rest of the protein chain) to form the native structure. In fact, energies of this magnitude were computed to account for the stabilization of two anti-parallel righthanded a-helices (with an intervening hairpin bend) of poly(L-alnine) in water (Silverman and Scheraga, 1972). Also, energies of the same order of magnitude can raise the melting point of a protein considerably; this was observed recently for ~-glyceraldehyde-Sphosphate dehydrogenase from a thermophilic bacterium, where the extra stability (i.e., an increase of -40" in the melting point due to a stabilization energy of -10 kcal/mole) arises from subtle features of the molecular structure (Fujita and Imahori, 1974).
D . Examination of Small Fragments
It is well known (Schellman, 1955; Zimm and Bragg, 1959; Lifson and Roig, 1961) that short oligopeptides (4 or 5 residues in length) cannot form stable a-helices in aqueous solution. However, it is of interest to determine whether the four-residue segments that contribute p-bends or chain reversals (see Fig. 23) in proteins can exist to any significant extent in the native format as an excised fragment. The technique of Section VI1,C may provide an answer to this question, and such experiments are in progress with a chain-reversal segment of staphylococcal nuclease (S. J. Leach, H. A. Scheraga, and C. B. Anfinsen, unpublished). In addition, a physicochemical ap-

PROTEIN FOLDING

257

proach is being used to determine whether the properties of short oligopeptides can show that a detectable amount of native format is present in the total population of conformations (Scheraga et al., 1973).
For this purpose, the sequence (1) Asp-Lys-Thr-Gly (residues 35-38 in a-chymotrypsin), which forms a chain reversal in this enzyme, has been considered along with the following variants of the sequence: (2) Gly-Thr-Asp-Lys, (3) Asp-Lys-Gly-Thr, and (4) LysThr-Gly-Asp. To avoid end effects, these tetrapeptides were blocked with CH, CO-and-NHCH, groups at the N-and C- termini, respectively (Howard et al., 1975). Using probabilities for the occurrence of the chain-reversal conformation (Lewis et al., 1971), the relative probabilities of occurrence of bends in these four tetrapeptides are 20, 1,40, and 40, respectively. Thus, peptides 3 and 4 have the highest probability of occurrence as a bend, the native

one (No. 1) is next, and peptide 2 has the lowest probability. In other words, the probability of occurrence of a bend in a given tetrapeptide depends not only on its composition, but also on its amino acid sequence.
At 5°C in aqueous solution, peptides 1, 3, and 4 exhibit a detectable nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) indicating that, in a small fraction of each of these peptides, the methyl protons of the CH,COand -NHCH, end groups are near each other (which implies that a bend exists in some fraction of these molecules) (Howard et al., 1975). No such effect is detected at 26°C. Further, peptides 1, 3, and 4 exhibit a different circular dichroism (CD) behavior from peptide 2 at 5°C (see Fig. 24). Making use of theoretical calculations of rotational strengths of such bend conformations (Woody, 1974), it has been concluded from these CD and NOE data that a small (but significant) fraction of the total population of conformations of peptides 1,3, and 4 (but not peptide 2) exists in a chain-reversal conformation. This conclusion is supported by conformational energy calculations (Howard et al., 1975) in which the energies of approximately 80 starting conformations per tetrapeptide (selected from highprobability conformations for the individual residues) were minimized. For peptides 1 , 3 , and 4, the minimum-energy conformations were bends, and were several kilocalories per mole lower in energy than any other conformation considered. For peptide 2, there were five low-energy conformations (including a bend), all within 3 kcal/mole of each other, indicating that there was no strong preference for this sequence to adopt a bend conformation, but rather to distribute among at least five different conformations.
VIII. ENERGETICFACTORDSETERMININPGROTEINFOLDING
The foregoing experimental evidence indicates that a native protein has a conformation that is a stable minimum in a multidimensional energy surface which depends on all interactions between the atoms of the protein molecule and between the protein molecule and the solvent. Whether or not this minimum is the one of lowest free energy has not yet been determined unambiguously. If it were not the one of lowest free energy, then it would follow that unique pathways exist to reach the same native structure (for example, the same conformation of native ribonuclease is formed from the denatured protein with its disulfide bonds intact and from the more unfolded form with its disulfide bonds reduced, as discussed in Section 11) and that very high energy barriers prevent the polypeptide chain from attaining the conformation of lowest free energy. The attain-

PROTEIN FOLDING

259

ment of the native conformation (of a single chain) from several dif-

ferent initial states (Hantgan et al., 1974) suggests that the pathways

are not unique, and that the various regions of the conformational

space are accessible from one another without insurmountable inter-

vening energy barriers (except possibly those required to prevent

passage to an aggregated denatured form). Thus, in our view, it ap-

pears likely, though by no means proved, that the native conforma-

tion of a protein is indeed the one of lowest free energy.

This is not to say that all of conformational space must be traversed

in the folding of a polypeptide chain. If the chain explored all pos-

sible conformations at random by rotations about the various single

bonds of the structure, it would take too long to reach the native con-

formation. For example, if the individual residues of an unfolded

polypeptide chain can exist in only two states, which is a gross un-

derestimate, then the number of possible randomly generated con-

formations is for a chain of 150 amino acid residues (although, of

course, most of these would probably be sterically impossible ones).

If each conformation could be explored with a frequency of a molec-

ular rotation

sec-I), which is an overestimate, it would take

approximately 10'" years to examine all possible conformations.

Since the synthesis and folding of a protein chain such as that of

ribonuclease or lysozyme can be accomplished in about 2 minutes

(Lacroute and Stent, 1968; Wilhelm and Haselkorn, 1970; Hunt et

al., 1969; Goldberger et al., 1963),it is clear that all conformations are

not traversed in the folding process. Instead, it appears to us that, in

response to local interactions, the polypeptide chain is directed along

a variety of possible low-energy pathways (relatively small in

number), possibly passing through unique intermediate states, to-

ward the conformation of lowest free energy. Evolution (with ther-

modynamics dictating the folding) has selected the amino acid

sequence to form a biologically active molecule, with presumably a

limited number of pathwaysfrom the unfolded form to a unique na-

tive structure of lowest free energy.

A. Thermodynamic Criterion for the Native State
Accepting the hypothesis that the native conformation is the one of lowest free energy (Liquori, 1969; Ramachandran, 1969; Ramachandran and Sasisekharen, 1968; Scheraga, 1968, l969,1971,1973a,b), it is important to realize that entropic as well as energetic factors contribute to the free energy. Since a macromolecule in solution is not a static entity, there are two major sources of entropy: (1)from the various possible configurations of the solvent molecules for a given

260

C. B. ANFINSEN AND H. A. SCHERAGA

conformation of the macromolecule, and ( 2 ) from the translational and overall rotational motion of the macromolecule and from its internal vibrations that arise from the stretching of bonds, the bending of bond angles, and the variations of dihedral angles for rotation around single bonds. The sum of the entropy of solvation and the potential energy of all intrapolypeptide interactions constitutes the “conformational energy” (the term “conformational energy,” as defined and used in this context, is a free energy), which may be represented on a multidimensional surface as a function of the conformation of the macromolecule. This surface is a very complicated one. Stable macroscopic conformations of the macromolecule in solution correspond to local minima of the “conformational energy,” and the macromolecule undergoes stable oscillations around each of these minima. These oscillations contribute a conformational entropy; hence every macroscopic conformation corresponds to a col-
lection of neighboring microscopic states (those located around each minimum of the “conformational energy”), the free energy of each macroscopic conformation depending on both the magnitude of the “conformational energy” at the minimum and on the contribution from all the vibrational states (plus the overall rotational entropy) in the neighborhood of the minimum.
We assume that the native conformation of a protein is that which corresponds to the local minimum of the “conformational energy” which has the lowest free energy. As shown schematically in Fig. 25, this need not be the global minimum of the “conformational energy”; that is, a local minimum near the global one may have a lower free energy because of contributions from the librational motion. This effect has been observed in computations on poly(L-
alanine) (Gibson and Scheraga, 1969a,b) and on cyclo(Gly,Pro,) (Go et al., 1970).
The calculations of stable conformations of polypeptides and proteins then involves three different problems. First, the geometry (i,e,,bond lengths and bond angles) of the polypeptide chain must be known, and the functional form (and the values of the parameters) of the “conformational energy” must be determined. Second, the “conformational energy” must be minimized to locate the various local minima. Third, the free energy (which includes the conformational entropy) of each minimum within a reasonable range of the global one, i.e., within about 1kcal per residue, must be calculated. A discussion of this computational approach (including the nature and magnitude of the interaction energies involved), and its application to a variety of model polypeptides as well as proteins, has been

presented elsewhere (Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968; Scheraga, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1974a). While a number of problems remain to be solved before one can compute the most stable conformation of a protein in water, those involving the nature of the “conformational energy” function and the calculation of the free energy have been resolved in principle, and in practice in some cases. However, the problem of the existence of many local minima in the multidimensional energy surface remains a formidable one. Since (energy) minimization algorithms lead to the nearest local minimum, depending on the starting point, resort has been had to the search for alternative methods that would lead to initial starting points which might have a reasonable chance of being in the correct potential energy well; then, energy minimization would lead to the desired local minimum. The search for alternative methods for obtaining an initial conformation of a protein (to be followed by energy minimization) has revealed some important energetic and stereochemical features of polypeptide chains, which provide insight into the folding process (Scheraga, 1974a,b).
For reasons outlined in Section VIII,B,l, one of the approaches for finding alternative methods was a consideration of the possible dominance of short-range interactions (Kotelchuck and Scheraga, 1968, 1969). This investigation led to the concept that the conformation of an amino acid residue in a polypeptide or protein is determined in very large measure (though not exclusively) by the short-range interactions between a side chain and the atoms of the backbone of the same amino acid residue, and is (again in first approximation) essentially independent of interactions with neighboring side chains or backbone portions of the chain. In a second ap-

proximation, medium-range interactions (those within four residues on either side of a given one) contribute additional stabilization (Pon-
nuswamy et d . ,197313). The view that short-range interactions dominate receives further support from statistical analyses of the confor-
mations of amino acid residues in globular proteins, and empirical conformation prediction schemes based thereon, as discussed in Section VII1,C. Therefore, in Section VIII,B, we shall trace the development of this concept (Scheraga, 1973b), in order to see how it may help overcome the multiple-minimum problem.
B . Role of Short-, Medium-, and Long-Range Interactions
In considering the energetic and entropic factors that determine the conformation of a polypeptide in a given solvent, it is useful to distinguish between short-, medium-, and long-range interactions since these contribute to the stability to differing extents, as stated above. In order to discriminate among different amino acid residues, the term “short-range,” as used here, refers to an interaction between the side chain of an amino acid residue with the atoms of its own backbone, and does not include side chain-side chain interactions. The interactions between the atoms of a given residue with those of nearby residues (within four residues of the given one) are designated as “medium-range,” and the interactions with more remote residues along the chain (even though, possibly, nearby in space), are termed “long-range.”
1. The &Point
The basis for looking for a possible dominance of short-range interactions in proteins comes from the behavior of model systems, viz., randomly coiled polymers. Under appropriate conditions, the conformation of a randomly coiled homopolymer chain is determined exclusively by short-range interactions. Therefore, we consider first the conditions under which medium- and long-range interactions make no contribution to the conformation. The treatment of an ideal homopolymer chain by random-flight statistics leads to the conclusion that some average linear dimension of the chain, e.g., the rootmean-square end-to-end distance < 7 > l i Z , varies with the square root of the molecular weight (Flory, 1953). While medium-, long-range, and excluded volume effects (not included in the random-flight cal-
culation) tend to increase <rZ>l/z beyond its ideal value, the choice
of an appropriate (poor) solvent (in which polymer-polymer contacts are favored over polymer-solvent contacts) can reduce <T+’’~ to its ideal value (Flory, 1953). Under these conditions (i.e., at the so-

PROTEIN FOLDING

263

called &point), the polymer-polymer and polymer-solvent interactions compensate the medium-, long-range, and excluded volume ef-
fects, and the ideal value of <P>linwhich results is determined
exclusively by short-range interactions (Flory, 1953). Although a protein in aqueous salt solution may not be at the 0-point, the possibility existed that its conformation, while not determined exclusively by short-range interactions, might nevertheless be dominated by them. As will be shown here, the dominance of short-range interactions has been demonstrated for the formation of a-helical and nonhelical portions of proteins (Kotelchuck and Scheraga, 1968, 1969; Finkelstein and Ptitsyn, 1971), and for the formation of p-turns (Lewis e t al., 1971) and extended structures (Burgess et al., 1974a).
2. Empirical Procedures f o r Predicting Helical and Other Regions in Proteins
The foregoing argument, that short-range interactions may be dominant, is the implicit basis for the success, to differing extents, of various empirical procedures for predicting the location of helical, extended, p-turns, and other regions in proteins; these prediction schemes are considered in Section VIII,C. In essentially all these procedures, known X-ray structures were examined, and attempts were made to assign specific conformational preferences (e.g., righthanded a-helix, extended structure, or p-turn) to each of the amino acid residues. Using these preferences, and various rules that differed from author to author, predictions were made about the existence or nonexistence of various conformational features in other proteins. Such empirical predictive schemes (based solely on the behavior of single residues, or on short sequences of residues) would not lead to meaningful conclusions if short-range interactions were not dominant.
3. Conformational Preferences within a Single Peptide Unit
To examine the energetic basis for the validity of the hypothesis that short-range interactions are dominant, a study was made (Kotelchuck and Scheraga, 1968, 1969) of the role of these interactions in helix formation for proteins of known structure. In particular, calculations were carried out to obtain the energy of interaction of individual side chains in lysozyme with side chains that are nearest neighbors along the backbone, as well as with the backbone groups themselves. It was found that, for various initial backbone conformations (viz., the right- and left-handed a-helices, aRand aL,r,espec-
tively, and the antiparallel pleated sheet structure, p), the conforma-

tion of lowest energy after minimization was the same in most cases for a given amino acid residue and was independent of the nature of the next amino acid in the chain. Furthermore, the backbone struc-
tures corresponding to the lowest energy (Lea,aR,p, or aL)showed a
high degree of correlation with the so-called helix-making or helixbreaking character of a residue, as determined by the earlier empirical studies (cited in Sections VIII,B,2 and VII1,C) on the identification of a-helical regions in proteins. In other words, it appears that the short-range interactions within a given peptide unit may be the physical origin of the so-called helical potential of a residue. In addition, since the side chain-side chain interactions do not play a
major role in determining backbone conformation in most cases, the cooperativity among residues, which is necessary for the formation of a helical segment, may simply be the additive effect of placing some sequence of helix-making residues in a particular region. This suggested a model for helix formation in which each type of peptide unit in proteins of known amino acid sequence was assigned a desig-
nation h or c (helix-making or helix breaking, respectively), based on
a study of the energy surface of the peptide unit. Then, from an examination of the h or c assignments for lysozyme, myoglobin, achymotrypsin, and ribonuclease, empirical rules were formulated to distinguish between helical and nonhelical regions. These rules
are: (a) an a-helical segment will be nucleated when at least four h residues in a row appear in the amino acid sequence, and (b) this helical segment will continue growing toward the C-terminus of the protein until two c residues in a row occur, a condition that tenni-
nates the helical segment. These rules were consistent with the helical or nonhelical state of 78% of the residues of the four proteins mentioned above (Kotelchuck and Scheraga, 1968, 1969).
With the later availability of the X-ray structures of seven proteins, the validity of these rules was examined further (Kotelchuck et al., 1969). It was observed that, if a nonhelical dipeptide ever occurred at the C-terminus of a helical region, it had a low probability of occurring elsewhere in a helical region and as high as a 90% probability of occurring elsewhere in nonhelical regions; i.e., two c residues in a row prevent further growth of a helical segment. It was also found that those residues designated as c’s tended to predominate at the C-termini of helical segments. These results constitute an experimental demonstration of the validity of rule b above. Finkelstein and Ptitsyn (1971)also made a statistical analysis of the conformations of amino acid residues in proteins of known structure, and came to similar conclusions, viz., that short-range interactions are

PROTEIN FOLDING

265

dominant, in that single residues can be classified as helix-making or helix-breaking and that side chain-side chain interactions play a minor role in determining the conformational preference of a given amino acid residue. Similarly, short-range interactions have been shown to dominate in determining the preferences for certain sequences to form extended structures and p-turns (see Sections VIII,B,7 and B,8). The success of the more recent empirical rules for predicting conformational features of proteins, discussed in Section VIII,C, confirms the validity of the concept of the dominance of short-range interactions.
At this point, it is of interest to consider the factors that determine the conformational preference of a given amino acid residue. The conformational entropy of a residue in the random coil state’ must be overcome by favorable energetic factors in order for the residue to be helix-making; otherwise, it will be helix-breaking. Glycyl residues, with no side chains, have no favorable energetic factors to enhance helix formation; thus, the entropy of the coil makes glycyl residues helix-breaking (M. Go et al., 1971). When a P-CH, group is added, the resulting nonbonded interactions tend to favor the aRconformation (Kotelchuck and Scheraga, 1968, 1969; M. Go et al., 1971). Thus, alanine is a helix-making residue (M. Go et al., 1971). While all amino acids besides glycine have a P-CH, group, they are not all
helix-making because of interactions involving groups beyond the p-
carbon; for example, in Asn which is helix-breaking, electrostatic interaction between a polar side-chain group and the polar backbone amide group destabilizes the aRconformation relative to other confor-
mations. In Gln and Glu, the electrostatic effect is weaker because of the greater distance between the backbone amide group and the
polar side-chain group (resulting from entropically favored extended side-chain conformations); hence the preferred conformation for Gln and Glu is aR. Recently, an extensive series of conformational energy calculations (including the computation of free energies) was carried out for the N-acetyl-”-methyl amides of all twenty naturally occurring amino acids (Lewis et al., 1973b). From these calculations, it is possible to assess how the various energetic factors con-

;When the protein is in its unfolded form, in principle every residue may take on an ensemble of conformations (the random coil state), which contributes a conformational entropy. When the protein folds to its native form, all residues (even the nonhelical or, in general, nonregular ones) adopt a specific conformation (not an ensemble), and this entropy is lost (except for the small conformational fluctuations of the native structure); thus, it is incorrect to refer to residues that are in nonregular conformations in the nutioe protein as being in the random coil state.

tribute to the conformational preferences of each residue. For example, the side chains of both Ser and Asp can form hydrogen bonds
with the nearby backbone amide groups when these residues are in nonhelical conformations, as illustrated in Figs. 26 and 27; thus, Ser
and Asp are helix-breaking. The fact that various residues have dif-
ferent preferences for selected conformations is also indicated by 4,
$ diagrams for the 20 amino acids in proteins of known X-ray struc-
+, ture (Burgess et al., 1974). From Figs. 28-31, it can be seen that
the distribution of $ conformations varies for each amino acid and, in many cases, appears to reflect the particular characteristics of each amino acid; e.g., the restricted extended-structure region for Val (Fig. 30) is caused by the bulky Cy methyl groups. The differences
between the various amino acids tend to be lost when the 4, $ dis-
tributions for all the amino acids are pooled (Pohl, 1971). The data
+of Figs. 28-31 have been used to compute the mean values of 4 and (and their relative probabilities of occurrence) for each of the 20 amino acids in several conformational states (Burgess et al., 1974); similar data have been used by Chou and Fasman (1974a,b) to com-
pute relative probabilities of occurrence. Such data are used in the empirical predictive schemes discussed in Section VII1,C.

4. Quantitative Specification of Helix-Making and Helix-Breaking Character
Having demonstrated that the conformation of an amino acid residue in a protein is determined largely by short-range interactions, and, thus, in first approximation is essentially independent of the chemical nature of its neighbors, it becomes desirable to have a quantitative scale to specify, say, the helix-making and helixbreaking character of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids, instead of the earlier (Kotelchuck and Scheraga, 1968, 1969) assignment of all amino acids to two categories, h or c. We consider here a specific model for helix and coil, and in Section VII1,C we examine empirical rules for predicting various conformations (including helical ones). A model that suggests itself for specifying helix-making and helix-breaking character is the thermally induced helix-coil transition in homopolymers; that is, the Zimm-Bragg (1959) parameters cr and s, which characterize the transition curve, would appear to provide a quantitative basis for specifying the helix-making and -breaking tendency of any amino acid in its corresponding homopolymer (and, therefore, in a protein, since short-range interactions dominate in both cases). If the values of cr and s for a particular homopolymer are such that it melts at low temperature, then the corresponding residues would be helix-breaking; similarly, helixmaking residues would have values of (T and s indicating that the corresponding homopolymer would melt at high temperatures.
The quantities u and s are equilibrium constants for the elementary processes involved in the nucleation and growth, respectively,

271

of helical sequences (Zimm and Bragg, 1959; Poland and Scheraga, 1970). If a long helical sequence exists in a homopolymer, the helical portion can be lengthened by one residue (the growth process) by restricting the dihedral angles of the residue to those characteristic of the aR helix and, thereby, forming one additional hydrogen bond; the equilibrium constant for this process is s.

...h h h h h h c ... & ... h h h h h h h ...

(18)

On the other hand, in order to initiate the formation of a helix in a

nonhelical region (the nucleation process), the dihedral angles of

three consecutive residues must be restricted to those of the a-helix,

and only one hydrogen bond is formed; the equilibrium constant for

this process is CT?.

- ... c c c ..’ ...h h h ...

(19)

- Since s 1 in the transition region, the small value of CT

expresses the fact that it is much more difficult to start a helix (Reac-

tion 19) than to increase the size of an already existing one (Reaction

18). The parameter s depends on temperature, while the theoreti-

cally expected (Poland and Scheraga, 1965) temperature-dependence

of CT is too small to detect experimentally. The curve for the melting

of a homopolyamino acid a-helix to the random coil form (the helix-

coil transition curve) can be computed from a knowledge of CT and

the values of s at various temperatures. If the experimental transi-

tion curve is available, the values of CT and s can be obtained by fit-

ting the experimental data by a theoretical curve.

In principle, then, CT and s could be determined for each naturally

occurring amino acid by studying the thermally induced helix-coil

transition of the corresponding homopolymer in water. For such a

procedure to be feasible (Scheraga, 1971; von Dreele et al., 1971a,b),

the homopolymer must satisfy three requirements, viz., it must (1)be

water soluble, (2)be helical in water at low temperature, and (3)melt

to the random coil in water as the temperature is increased. In prac-

tice, none of the homopolymers of the naturally occurring amino

acids satisfies these three requirements. Therefore, homopolymers

cannot be used for this purpose, and resort is had instead to the use

of random copolymers of two components-a helical host, e.g.,

poly(hydroxypropy1- or hydroxybutylglutamine) (which does satisfy

these three requirements and for which CT and s are determinable)

and the guest residues; from the effect of increasing amounts of the

guest residues on the helix-coil transition curve of the homopolymer

of the host residues, it is possible to determine CT and s for the guest

residues. Thus far, these experiments have been carried out for the following guest residues: Gly (Ananthanarayanan et al., 1971), Ala (Platzer et al., 1972), Ser (Hughes et al., 1972), Leu (Alter et al., 1972), Phe (Van Wart et al., 1973), and Val (Alter e t al., 1973), and the results are shown in Fig. 32. Further experiments on the remaining naturally occurring amino acids are in progress (H. A. Scheraga and co-workers, unpublished work). It can be seen that Gly and Ser are helix breakers, Gly more so than Ser because s < 1,
and Ala and Leu are helix makers, Leu more so than Ala. Val is a helix breaker at low temperature and helix maker above 40°C. Since the experiments were carried out in aqueous solution, the resulting experimental values of w and s contain all energetic and entropic contributions (including solvation) which determine the conforma-
tional preference. Also, the assumption that short-range interactions determine the behavior of the guest residue implies that the values determined for (T and s are independent of the nature of the host; the validity of this assumption is being tested experimentally (H. A. Scheraga and co-workers, unpublished work).

5. Helix Probability Profiles
The experimental values of cr and s can be used to obtain information about the conformation of any specific sequence of amino acids, e.g., that of a protein. However, since the values of cr and s were obtained from the Zimm-Bragg theory, which is based on the one-dimensional Ising model, we cannot treat the native protein molecule since its conformation is, in some measure, influenced by long-range interactions which are not taken into account in the Zimm-Bragg theory. Since the denatured protein is devoid of tertiary structure and hence, presumably, of long-range interactions other than excluded volume effects, the polypeptide conforms to the one-dimensional Ising model. Thus, above the denaturation tempera-
-ture, we may apply the Zimm-Bragg formulation to this copolymer of 20 amino acids to determine the probability that any given residue of the chain will be in the aR or in the random coil conformation, respectively (Lewis et al., 1970). It will then be shown that there is a correlation between the calculated probability profile of the denatured protein and the experimentally observed aRregions in the corresponding native structures; i.e., in many cases, those regions in the denatured protein which exhibit a propensity for being in the conformation correspond to the regions observed in the native protein.
The partition function 2, and the probability, P H ( i ) ,that the ith amino acid (of type A) in a chain of N residues is in the aRconformation are given by

sA(j)is the statistical weight assigned to this residue when it is in an aRconformation and preceded by a residue in the aR conformation, and uA(j)sA(j) is the statistical weight assigned to this residue when it

is in an aR conformation and preceded by a residue in the random

coil conformation; Eqs. (20)-(22)pertain to the model of the helix-

coil transition that is implied by Eqs. (18) and (19). The use of Eq.

(21) to compute PH(i)automatically includes the cooperativity which

is characteristic of the nearest-neighbor one-dimensional Ising

model.

The values of (T and s, determined in aqueous solution (as in-

dicated in Section VIII,B,4), apply to the initial folding of a polypep-

tide chain; that is, the groups of a denatured protein are exposed to

water and the values of (T and s (obtained from random copolymers in

water) determine their tendency to form helices in the denatured

protein, before the onset of globularity buries the helix in the non-

aqueous interior of the protein.

Pending the acquisition of data, such as those of Fig. 32, for the

remainder of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids, the set of

amino acids has been grouped into three categories (all with (T taken

as 5 x

viz., helix breakers (with s = 0.385), helix formers (with

s = 1.05),and helix indifferent (with s = 1.00). Taking into account

the limited data of Fig. 32, the earlier h and c assignments of Ko-

telchuck and Scheraga (1968, 1969),and the results of an information-

theory analysis by Pain and Robson (1970), the amino acids are as-

signed as in Table 111. It should be emphasized that these tentative

values of (T and s are used here only pending completion of experi-

ments that will complete Fig. 32 for the remaining amino acids.

Helix probability profiles for 11 proteins have been calculated

from Eq. (21),using the values of (T and s discussed above and the as-

From these and similar curves for other proteins, it appears that there is a close correlation between the propensity of a particular amino acid residue to be in the aRconformation in the denatured protein and its occurrence in a helical region in the globular structure of the corresponding native protein. On this basis, it was suggested (Lewis et al., 1970) that, during renaturation, the protein chain acquires specific long-range interactions which stabilize the helical regions that tend to form in certain portions of the chain; that is, folding of the polypeptide chain into the native conformation of a protein is thought to occur by incipient formation of nucleation sites (which may be helical if the constituent residues have a propensity for this conformation) stabilized

by specific long-range interactions, with the remainder of the protein molecule then folding around these stabilized nucleation sites.
Consistent with this view, it is found (Lewis and Scheraga, 1971a) that, despite amino acid substitutions in a series of 27 species of cytochrome c proteins, there is a striking similarity in their helix probability profiles, and a good correlation with the location of the helical regions in the X-ray-determined structure of the horse and bonito proteins (see Figs. 33 and 34). Among other things, the preponderance of two helix-breaking residues at the C-termini of helical sections (except at the C-terminus of the molecule where helixbreaking residues are not needed to break the helix), shown in Fig. 34, confirms the earlier, more primitive rule (b)mentioned in Section VIII,B,3). It appears that amino acid substitutions may be tolerated in evolution, provided that the helix-making or helix-breaking tendency (i.e., values of m and s) of each amino acid residue is preserved, thereby enabling the altered protein to maintain the same three-dimensional conformation and, hence, the same biological function.

logies in their amino acid sequence, led to very similar helix proba-
bility profiles (see Fig. 35). This result supports earlier suggestions (Brew e t al., 1967; Hill et al., 1968; Browne et al., 1969) that the two
proteins might have similar three-dimensional structures, and again demonstrates the conservative nature of amino acid replacements (as far as helix-forming power in homologous proteins is concerned) which was found for the cytochrome c proteins. Interestingly, it has been possible to obtain a low-energy structure of a-lactalbumin by energy minimization, starting with a conformation which resembles that of lysozyme (Warme et al., 1974).
6. Zmplication f o r Nucleation and Folding of Protein Chains
The results presented in Section VIII,B,5 are of importance for an understanding of how the three-dimensional structure of a protein is nucleated in specific regions so that the whole chain may then fold up into the native structure. As pointed out in the Introduction, the nucleation sites may be regular or nonregular.
In discussing the situation in which the nucleation site in the folding of a protein chain is a helical one, consider first the formation of an a-helical section of j residues in a homopolymer (Poland and Scheraga, 1970). In the nearest-neighbor Ising model, the statistical weight of such a section is ( T S ~[see Eqs. (18)and (19)]. In addition, there is a combinatorial entropy which stabilizes such a helical section; this entropy arises from the fact that this helical sequence can appear in many locations in the chain. However, in a copolymer,

278

C . B. ANFINSEN AND H. A. SCHERAGA

helical sequences tend to be more localized in specific parts of the

chain, with a higher probability the greater the values of ( T a~nd sA

for the specific residues in the given local amino acid sequence

(Poland and Scheraga, 1969a,b, 1970). In the absence of long-range

interactions, the formation of a helical region in a given part of a pro-

tein chain depends primarily on the factor vsj rather than on the

combinatorial entropy. Since (T

u s j can approach unity only if

siapproaches lo4. But s varies only from -1.02 to -0.98 throughout

the transition range of a homopolymer. Thus, even with the value of
1.02 for s, j would have to be -500 in order that sj approach lo4.

This is simply a statement of the well-known fact that helical

sequences have to be very large to be stable-in a system behaving

according t o the one-dimensional Ising model. In an infinite chain

conforming to this model, the most probable length of a helical

sequence in the middle of the transition range (i.e., at s = 1)is

(or -100 residues), and shorter helical sequences have a lower prob-

ability of occurrence. If one wanted to assign a value much greater

than 1.02 to s, in order to achieve stability for short helical sections,

one would encounter the dilemma that a chain with such helical

sequences would not be predicted to denature in the accessible tem-

perature range of 0-loo", whereas most proteins are observed to do

so. However, short helical sequences ( 5 10 residues long) are

known to occur in native proteins. How can we account for this and,

at the same time, for the longer helical regions in myoglobin, etc.?

Clearly, a short helical sequence cannot be stable in a polypeptide

conforming to the one-dimensional Ising model. However, our view

is that, because a protein is not a homopolymer, small regions in the

amino acid sequence of the protein can be densely populated with

helix-making residues, which make it more likely that an a-helix will

form in that region compared to other regions, but that the stabiliza-

tion of these incipient a-helical structures into actual short helical

sequences in the native protein is accomplished by means of specific

medium- and long-range interactions (Lewis e t al., 1970). It is just

these medium- and long-range interactions that lead to globularity

and thus the inapplicability of the one-dimensional Ising model in a

native protein. On the other hand, this model is still applicable to a

copolymer of, say, A and B units, in those cases in which the pres-

ence of a second component does not disrupt the one-dimensional

character of the a-helical form of the first component, and indeed the

data of Fig. 32 were obtained from such copolymers.

The correlations between the regions of higher helical propensity

in the denatured state and the helical regions in the native structure

PROTEIN FOLDING

279

(shown in Fig. 33) suggest that, during folding, the protein chain acquires specific medium- and long-range interactions that tend to stabilize these short regions, which have a tendency to be helical (Lewis et al., 1970). The difficulty of forming this initial mediumand long-range interaction (nucleation) introduces the aspect of cooperativity with respect to the formation of the three-dimensional globular structure. The incipient formation of nucleation sites (among those residues with a propensity to adopt a particular local conformation, e.g., a-helices) stabilized by specific medium- and long-range interactions, may constitute the nucleation process for the refolding of the protein chain. The remainder of the protein molecule could then fold around these stabilized helical regions. Alternatively, in a protein with low helix content, other backbone conformations (regular, such as extended structures, or nonregular ones) may possibly serve as nucleation centers (Burgess et al., 1974). Some experimental approaches which lead to this same point of view were discussed in Sections VI1,C and D.
Again it should be noted that, although the one-dimensional Ising model can be applied to the denatured state (to assess the propensity toward helix formation), it is physically unrealistic for systems in which medium- and long-range interactions (beyond nearest or nextnearest neighbors) are operative. In this light, the correlations mentioned in Section VIII,B,2 lend further support to the substantial role of nearest-neighbor interactions in determining the overall threedimensional structure of the native protein. However, if there were no long-range interactions, e.g., if a portion of a protein molecule were cleaved from the rest of the chain, the protein presumably could not assume its native conformation; this was a possible explanation provided earlier (Epand and Scheraga, 1968)for the failure of three isolated portions of the myoglobin chain to assume the conformation which they have in the intact native protein. One encounters numerous examples for this requirement, that most of the protein chain be present in order that the molecule fold into its native conformation. For example, the S peptide and S protein of ribonuclease do not separately have the conformations which they do in the native ribonuclease molecule; however, when added together,
the two fragments interact to stabilize a three-dimensional structure which resembles that of native ribonuclease (Wyckoff et al., 1970). Such a bimolecular reaction has a reasonable chance of leading to a properly stabilized structure. The extra translational and rotational entropy loss required in a trimolecular reaction makes it less likely that three fragments can associate to form a structure resembling the

280

C. B. ANFINSEN AND H. A. SCHERAGA

native protein. However, as discussed earlier (Section 111), three large peptides derived from the sequences of both pancreatic ribonuclease and staphylococcal nuclease d o interact to form enzymically active complexes (Lin et al., 1970; Andria et al., 1971).
In summary, folding of a given intact protein chain appears to require the information of nucleation sites in specific parts of the amino acid sequence. These nucleation sites would be stabilized cooperatively only in the folding process involving long-range interactions between various parts of the chain. A schematic representation of such a mechanism is illustrated for the folding of ribonuclease in Fig. 20. The removal of a significant part of a protein chain would prevent such long-range interactions from stabilizing the folded structure, and the remaining part of the protein chain could not acquire the stable conformation which it has in the intact native protein.
7. Extended Structures
While the early efforts in predicting the preferences for local conformations were confined to the a-helix, the extended structure has also received considerable attention recently (Ptitsyn and Finkelstein, 1970; Burgess et al., 1974; Chou and Fasman, 1974a,b). It should be noted that “extended structure” is not p-structure, since the latter term implies information about the association of at least two extended structures in parallel or anti-parallel fashion. While conformational energy calculations on single residues (Lewis et al., 1973b)provide information about the relative probabilities of occurrence of various conformations for each residue, and have been used in this manner (Burgess et al., 1974), most reliance has thus far been placed on empirical probabilities of occurrence of these conformations based on observations of proteins of known X-ray structure. Thus, the probability of occurrence of extended structures, as well as helical structures, and chain reversals are treated empirically (see Section V111,C). The success of these prediction schemes attests to the dominance of short-range interactions in determining the conformational preferences in extended structures, as well as in helical regions.
8. Chain Reversals
While it appears that short-range interactions are responsible for the incipient formation of a-helical and extended-structure regions, which acquire stability only after the introduction of medium- and long-range interactions, it has already been pointed out at the begin-

PROTEIN FOLDING

28 1

ning of Section VIII that folding cannot occur by a random sampling of conformational space (Lewis et al., 1971). Thus, the incipient local-ordered regions must be directed toward each other to acquire stability; that is, medium- and long-range interactions are not brought into play by a chance encounter of the ordered regions. Instead, there is a tendency for chain reversals or p-turns to occur among certain amino acid residues, thereby “directing” the encounter of the ordered regions. Idealized types of p-turns are illustrated in Fig. 23 (Venkatachalam, 1968). However, the actual turns occurring in proteins do not have these idealized shapes (see Figs. 36 and 37) and, indeed, conformational energy calculations indicate that the hydrogen bond is not required for stability (Lewis et al., 1973a). The formation of a chain reversal should be regarded as an occurrence which depends on the proper juxtaposition of several residues, each of which has its own conformational preference (again, on the basis of short-range interactions) that enables it to participate in the chain reversal. From a statistical analysis of the amino acid compositions of the bends in three proteins, it has been possible to formulate rules for the prediction of the positions of the p-turns in protein sequences (Lewis et al., 1971). Application of these rules to several other proteins led to a high degree of correlation between the predicted regions where the p-turns should appear, and their existence in the (X-raydetermined) structure (Lewis et al., 1971). A discussion of 6-turns in proteins has also been presented by Popov and Lipkind (1971), Kuntz (1972), Esipova and Tumanyan (1972), Burgess et al. (1974), and Chou and Fasman (1974a,b). It is of interest that residues like Gly, Ser, and Asp, which have a low tendency toward helix formation, have a high propensity to form p-turns; that is, the preferred conformations, being ones which favor
,&turns, make it less likely that these residues will accommodate to helix formation.
A study has been reported (Crawford et al., 1973; Lewis et al., 1973a) of the bends found in the native structures of eight proteins. The 135 bends which were located (Lewis et al., 1973a) could be grouped among ten types (shown in Figs. 36 and 37), and over 40%
+ of the bends did not possess a hydrogen bond between the C=O of
residue i and the NH of residue i 3; that is, many of the bends observed in proteins do not have the idealized shapes indicated in Fig. 23. In addition, conformational energy calculations were carried out (Lewis et al., 1973a) on three tetrapeptides with amino acid sequences found as bends in the native structure of a-chymotrypsin. The results indicate that the bends occur not only in the whole mole-

cule, but should also exist to some extent in the free tetrapeptide in solution; i.e., the observed bends were the conformations of lowest energy even in the tetrapeptides (see also the discussion of tetrapeptides in Section VI1,D). From a study of the antibody-binding capacity of a loop portion of the lysozyme molecule (and several synthetic homologs of the loop), it appears that the biological activity of the excised loop can be correlated with the tendency toward preser-
vation of the three p-bends in this peptide (Arnon et al., 1974). The stability of the bends, compared to those of other structures, arises
principally from side chain-backbone interactions (e.g., a hydrogen
+ bond between the side-chain COO- of Asp in position i 3 and the + backbone NH of the residue in position i) rather than from i to i 3

284

C. B. ANFINSEN AND H. A. SCHERAGA

backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds. This result is consistent with the observation (Lewis et al., 1971) that residues with small polar side chains, such as Ser, Thr, Asp, and Asn, are found frequently in bends, presumably because these residues can interact most strongly with their immediate backbones (see also Figs. 26 and 27). Water may also play a role in stabilizing bends among these polar residues, especially since such bends usually occur on the surface of a protein.
From the above discussion, the following hypothesis for the folding of the polypeptide chain emerges: nucleation sites tend to form in certain regions of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chain, in response to short-range interactions. These are stabilized to yield a significant population of native structures, however, only when medium- and long-range interactions come into play (see also Section VI1,C). This is brought about by the formation of chain reversals among specific amino acid residues, also on the basis of short-range interactions, thereby enabling the nucleation sites to approach each other. The remainder of the polypeptide chain then folds around these one or more regions of interacting nucleation sites. The dominance of short-range interactions in determining backbone comformation, demonstrated for a-helices (Kotelchuck and Scheraga, 1968, 1969), p-turns (Lewis et al., 1971), and extended structures (Burgess et al., 1974), is a manifestation of the simple way in which nature makes use of the strong interactions between a side chain and its own backbone.
9. Medium-Range Interactions
If short-range interactions play the dominant role in forming local ordered regions, with long-range interactions being required for their stability, the question immediately arises as to the necessary
range of the long-range interactions -that is, do they encompass the

whole protein molecule or limited portions of it? To answer this question, conformational energy calculations were carried out on tri-, penta-, hepta-, and nonapeptide oligomers, as illustrated in Fig. 38 (Ponnuswamy et al., 1973b). The amino acid sequences were selected from lysozyme, and all dihedral angles of the central residue of each oligopeptide were varied during energy minimization in which the conformations of the residues on both sides of the central one were held fixed at those obtained from a partial energetic refinement (Warme and Scheraga, 1973) of the X-ray structure. While several computed energy minima are found for the tripeptides, the observed one (whose energy is indicated by the dashed line of Fig. 39, for each of 14 oligopeptides) becomes the preferred one (i.e., the one of lowest energy), in most cases, in the calculations involving the longer sequences (hepta- and nonapeptides), as illustrated in Fig. 39

286

C. B. ANFINSEN AND H. A. SCHERAGA

(Ponnuswamy et al., 1973b). This demonstrates that medium-range interactions (those present in the hepta- and nonapeptides) provide the additional interactions required to determine the conformation of the central residue (as the one observed in the X-ray structure of the whole protein). The four discrepancies which are still evident in the nonapeptides (Fig. 39D) may indicate that, in these few cases, longer-range interactions (involving more remote parts of the protein chain) are additionally required to determine the conformation of the central residue. Essentially similar results were obtained with nonapeptide segments of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Burgess and Scheraga, 1975a,c).
While short-range interactions play the dominant roIe in the formation of regular nucleation sites (e.g., a-helices and extended structures), medium-range interactions may contribute significantly in the formation of @-turnsand of nonregular, but specifically folded structures. The latter, illustrated in Fig. 20, usually involve mediumrange hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar side chains in water.
Besides demonstrating that short-range interactions are the most important ones, and medium-range interactions less so (but more important than longer-range ones) in determining protein backbone conformation, the computations described above may provide a way to circumvent the multiple-minimum problem in conformational energy calculation. Perhaps, by treating overlapping nonapeptides (whereby the energy is minimized by varying the conformation of the central residue), it might be possible to cycle several times through the whole protein to arrive at a rough conformation, which would then serve as a starting point for conventional energy minimization; such studies are in progress (see Section VII1,D). The selection of the initial conformation for energy minimization is based not only on these computations on nonapeptides, but also on the information gained about the regions where aR helical, extended structures and chain reversals are likely to occur.
C . Empirical Predictive Schemes
As mentioned in Section VIII,B,2, many empirical schemes (based on short- and medium-range interactions) have been proposed for the prediction of the gross backbone conformation of each amino acid residue in a native protein. However, as indicated in Figs. 28-31, the actual backbone conformation of a given residue may differ considerably from the mean value of the distribution in any given conformational region. Thus, even if the mean values could be pre-

PROTEIN FOLDING

287

dicted with 100% accuracy, a protein built from such mean values for each of its residues would not resemble (even in gross overall dimensions) the native structure. Instead, these predictive schemes may be useful in obtaining initial conformations for energy minimization (in which interactions over the whole protein molecule are then included). In the minimization, the medium- and long-range
interactions would induce the 4, $ values of each residue to move
away from the mean values, and thus enable the protein to attain the native structure. Thus, the predictive schemes would have contributed to the solution of the multiple-minimum problem.
It is in this light that empirical predictive schemes should be considered. Many such schemes have been published, and an extensive critique of these has been presented by Burgess et al. (1974).
These authors have proposed the use of a quantitative prediction index P to evaluate the various predictive schemes, where

P = N,Q - 1 for 0 < Q 6 1/N,

(23)

and

= number of residue states assigned correctly number of residues in the chain

(25)

i.e., the fraction of correctly predicted states, and N , is the number of states possible for each residue in the prediction model. The index P varies from -1 to +1 depending on the value of Q; if no states are predicted correctly, then P = -1, if the fraction of states predicted correctly (Q) is the same as expected for a random assignment of states (i.e., 1/N, for a model of N , states), then P = 0, and if all states are assigned correctly P = 1. The larger the value of N , in the model, the more is the information about the topography of the chain that is provided by a high value of P . Several of the currently used prediction algorithms provide fairly high values of P (say, -0.7) when averaged over many proteins. Since the primary use of these predictive schemes is to obtain a starting conformation for energy minimization, a fairly high value of P (but still less than 1) may possibly suffice to provide a suitable initial structure for subsequent energy minimization. However, this purpose will be better served if the prediction algorithms can be improved so that P approaches 1; using an optimization technique to obtain the probabilities of occurrence of various conformations (in a three-state model, viz., helix, extended structure, and coil), it has been possible to improve the

prediction scheme to the extent that the average value G f P for 15 proteins is -0.9 (Burgess et al., 1975a). Making use of the prediction index P , the various predictive schemes in the literature have been compared. This comparison is shown in Table IV (Burgess et uZ., 1974), from which it can be seen that no one scheme has achieved perfection.x On the one hand, one should not expect P to equal 1 unless the predictive schemes are modified to include longer-range interactions; on the other hand, the fact that most values of P are significantly greater than zero, and approach 1, indicates that short-range interactions play a dominant role in determining the conformational preference of each residue.

W. Burgess, private communication). An example of a successful application of empirical rules is provided by the recent work of Carter et al. (1974).

1 The three states .ire u - h e l ~ xe, xtended, and ci)II I The tour rtates are a-liehx, extended, bend, and cod 1 Thi\ .ipplied to the comlnned I3 and C Lhdln\
The empirical predictive procedure of Kabat and Wu (1973a,b) and Wu and Kabat (1973), based on tripeptide sequences, has not been included in Table IV because the nature of their predictions does not lend itself to this type of analysis. They presented two different procedures, for two different purposes. In the first procedure (Kabat
+ and Wu, 1973a,b), they tabulated frequences of occurrence of helix,
extended structure and coil in the ( n - 1)thand ( n 1)th positions of tripeptides from proteins of known structure, irrespective of the con-
formation at the nth position. Applying these frequencies to tripeptide portions of proteins of unknown structure, Kabat and Wu predict
+ which central residue of each tripeptide can disrupt either a helix or
an extended structure when the ( n - 1)th and ( n 1)th pair have low frequencies of occurrence for helix and extended structure. In their procedure, the portion of an amino acid sequence between their assigned helix-disrupting residues is permissively helix, if long enough, and likewise for permissive extended-structure regions. Thus, this procedure only rules out certain conformations. However, after helix-breaking and extended-structure-breaking residues are assigned by the procedure of Kabat and Wu (1973a,b), other methods (such as those summarized in Table IV) can be used for

predicting the conformation of the intervening residues. The second procedure of Wu and Kabat (1973) is applicable only to families of homologous protein sequences, not to an individual protein that is not a member of a homologous family. All members of the family of a homologous set of sequences are assumed to have the same backbone structure. In this procedure, they average the dihedral angles of proteins of known structure over many tripeptide conformations, including those not containing the central residue under consideration, i.e., dipeptide components of tripeptides. After observing which conformations of the central residue occur most frequently for each of several sequence variants, Kabat and Wu predict the value of the dihedral angles of the central residue in tripeptide sequences of all the proteins of a homologous family, e.g., cytochrome c . In several cases, more than one choice is possible for a given residue, and Kabat and Wu decide between these choices by model building.
D. A Possible Algorithm to Fold a Protein
If the predictive schemes can be improved to predict the average conformational state of each residue from among, say, five frequently observed states [envisaged (Burgess e t al., 1974) as right- and lefthanded a-helical conformations (aRand aL,respectively), extended conformations ( E ) , and conformations in the bridge regions between aRand E (&) and between aLand E (&ajlt,hough, by far, the most
frequently occurring states are aR and €1, then use can be made of
the information contained in the nonapeptide scheme of Fig. 38.
Initially, one of five states (with an average value of 4 and $ for each
type of residue) can be assigned to each residue in a nonapeptide in a protein. These assignments are based on conformational energy calculations, experimental determinations of CT and s and helix-
probability profiles computed therefrom (Sections VIII,B,4 and S),
and empirical parameters expressing the tendencies toward formation of the above five conformations. The conformational energy of the whole nonapeptide can then be minimized with respect to the dihedral angles of only the central residue. Then, an overlapping nonapeptide can be selected (shifted by one residue toward the Cterminus of the chain), and the five-state model can be applied again to all residues except the one whose dihedral angles were varied in the previous step; for this residue, the minimum-energy dihedral angles would be assigned. This process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 40 (Scheraga, 1974a,b). Thus, by moving down the whole length of a protein chain (and possibly repeating the process several times) it may be possible to determine whether the native conformation is being approached by successive approximation.

FIG. 40. Schematic illustration of successive steps in the computation of the

dihedral angles of a protein. The amino acid sequence is specified by the numbers 1,
2, . . . , 13, . . . , and the backbone conformations of each residue are specified ini-
tially as a,p, etc., but in terms of the dihedral angles cf~ and I/J after each computational

step. In step 1, one of the five conformational states is assigned to each residue in a

nonapeptide. In step 2, the energy of the nonapeptide is minimized with respect to

the dihedral angles of residue 5, etc. From Scheraga (1974a,b).

structure begins to resemble that of the native protein, it would be in the correct potential energy well; then the minimization of the conformational energy of the whole protein, not just that of nonapeptide segments, could be carried out. This procedure is now being tested, with the inclusion of an additional step between steps 1and 2 of Fig. 40, viz., variation of the average values of the dihedral angles of each residue in response to the requirement that the disulfide bonds be formed between the proper half-cystine residues (Burgess and Scheraga, 1975a,c). The final minimization over all pair interactions in the whole protein molecule makes use of computational procedures
similar to those already used for the energetic refinement of the X-ray structures of actinomycin D (Ponnuswamy et al., 1973a), lysozyme (Warme and Scheraga, 1974), and rubredoxin (Rasse et al., 1974); Levitt and Lifson (1969) and Nishikawa and Ooi (1972) have
also carried out energetic refinements of X-ray structures of proteins.

IX. CONCLUDINGREMARKS
It is now well documented experimentally that, in the proper environment, a polypeptide chain can fold spontaneously to the threedimensional structure of a native protein. It seems that, despite the possible presence of barriers in conformational space, the chain can find its way around these barriers to reach the structure of lowest free energy. While the validity of this thermodynamic hypothesis is not yet established unambiguously, it nevertheless seems to have a

292

sufficiently reasonable chance of holding true so that it provides a useful basis for treating the folding problem theoretically. Thus, the interatomic interactions within the chain, and between the chain and the solvent, dictate the folding, The range of the forces involved is such that near-neighbor interactions are dominant, and the backbone conformations of local segments of the chain are determined largely by such interactions. However, the native conformation becomes more stable in response, first, to medium- and second, to longerrange interactions. Folding is envisaged as taking place by the formation of nucleation sites in various parts of the chain, in response to near-neighbor (and similarly to medium-range) interactions; the various nucleation sites then become stabilized when they are brought into proximity (perhaps by formation of p-turns, which also depend on short-range interactions for their stability) so that longrange interactions can become operative. Empirical prediction algorithms, which incorporate not only short-range but also mediumrange interactions, would seem to offer the hope of leading to an approximately correct three-dimensional structure (i.e,, one within the correct potential energy well), so that subsequent energy minimization (which includes interactions between all pairs of atoms in the whole molecule) can lead to the native structure. The experiments described herein provide a reasonable basis for this point of view, and it remains to be seen whether this concept and the further development of conformational energy calculation procedures will enable the three-dimensional structure of a native protein to be predicted from a knowledge of its amino acid sequence and its interactions with the solvent in which it is dissolved.

NOTE ADDED IN PROOF
Some preliminary tests of the algorithm mentioned in Section VII1,D (and variants thereof) have been made (Burgess and Scheraga, 1975c), using bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor as a model, A starting conformation [referred to as a topographical structure (Burgess et al., 1974)] was obtained by assigning one of five states (aRa,,,,E ,
&+, t)to each residue, according to the observed X-ray structure; thus, the topographical
structure can be thought of as the result of a perfect prediction scheme. However, since the values of the backbone dihedral angles, 4 and @, assigned to each residue of the topographical structure were average values for each of the five states for each residue (obtained from Figs. 28-31), the overall topographical structure did not resemble the native one. In other words, the topographical structure had the correct

short-range conformation, but not the proper long-range arrangement. The energy of the whole topographical structure was then minimized by allowing successive nonoverlapping nonapeptide segments (in contact with the rest of the molecule) to undergo changes in conformation. While the energy minimization was not carried to cornpletion because of the large amount of computer time required, the preliminary results were encouraging in that, as the proper half-cystines were brought together to form
disulfide bonds, one of the key features of the structure (an anti-parallel p conformation) began to form; also, the a-helix at the C-terminus was preserved, the N- and
C-termini were near each other (as in the native structure), and no high-energy contacts occurred between distant parts of the chain. This indicates that energy minimization has the potential to lead from a topographical structure to the native one, and emphasizes the need to improve the reliability of the empirical prediction schemes discussed in Section VII1,C in order to obtain good starting conformations for energy minimization.
