ABSTRACT: Ions diﬀer in their ability to salt out proteins from
solution as expressed in the lyotropic or Hofmeister series of cations and anions. Since its ﬁrst formulation in 1888, this series has been invoked in a plethora of eﬀects, going
beyond the original salting out/salting in idea to include enzyme
activities and the crystallization of proteins, as well as to
processes not involving proteins like ion exchange, the surface
tension of electrolytes, or bubble coalescence. Although it has
been clear that the Hofmeister series is intimately connected to
ion hydration in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments
and to ion pairing, its molecular origin has not been
fully understood. This situation could have been summarized
as follows: Many chemists used the Hofmeister series as a mantra to put a label on ion-speciﬁc behavior in various environments, rather than to reach a molecular level understanding and, consequently, an ability to predict a particular eﬀect of a given salt ion on proteins in solutions. In this Feature Article we show that the cationic and anionic Hofmeister series can now be rationalized primarily in terms of speciﬁc interactions of salt ions
with the backbone and charged side chain groups at the protein surface in solution. At the same time, we demonstrate the limitations of separating Hofmeister eﬀects into independent cationic and anionic contributions due to the electroneutrality condition, as well as speciﬁc ion pairing, leading to interactions of ions of opposite polarity. Finally, we outline the route beyond Hofmeister chemistry in the direction of understanding speciﬁc roles of ions in various biological functionalities, where
generic Hofmeister-type interactions can be complemented or even overruled by particular steric arrangements in various ion
binding sites.

■ INTRODUCTION
Some salts are good at precipitating proteins from aqueous solutions, while others are not. Why is this the case? What is it, beyond the charge of the salt ions (the absolute value of which is the same for all monovalent salts), that determines the protein salting out ability of a particular salt? Are the chemical details of the interactions of ions with water and with each other crucial? Or, is Hofmeister series chemistry more about the speciﬁc interactions of individual salt ions with the surfaces of aqueous proteins?

Here, we address the above questions, combining molecular level computer modeling and spectroscopic techniques as well as thermodynamic considerations in order to obtain a scalebridging (from molecular to macroscopic) understanding of speciﬁc ion eﬀects on proteins in aqueous solution. Achieving this goal allows us not only to address problems concerning the

salting out of proteins, but also sheds light on other issues such as salt eﬀects on protein stability and denaturation or enzymatic
activity. Before getting into the technical details, it is important ﬁrst to introduce the history of studies concerning ion-speciﬁc eﬀects on proteins, which started in the German part of the
Charles University in Prague in the 1880s with Franz Hofmeister. Below, we build on previous reviews of this history1−15 and walk
the reader through the developments, which eventually led to today’s molecular level understanding of the Hofmeister series
(Figure 1).
Hofmeister and his collaborators summarized their investigations of ion-speciﬁc eﬀects in a series of seven articles
published in the German literature between 1887 and 1898.
The two most important ones, i.e., the second paper entitled “About regularities in the protein precipitating eﬀects of salts and the relation of these eﬀects with the physiological behavior of salts”16 and the third publication entitled “About the water withdrawing eﬀect of the salts”17 were translated into English about a dozen years ago.18 The extensive studies of the
salting out of proteins and other substances by Hofmeister were ingenious in several respects. He was the ﬁrst person to quantify salting out eﬀects systematically for a whole set of
salts (later called the Hofmeister series, see Figures 1 and 2).
Moreover, he employed several series of salts with a common
cation (or anion), allowing for the construction of separate
Hofmeister series for anions and cations, as we know it today (Figure 2). It is worth mentioning that his ﬁrst studies on the
subject appeared only a few years after Arrhenius came up with the idea that salts actually dissociate into ions in water.19
Hofmeister aimed at categorizing the salts, but also the species
being salted out, encompassing several proteins, as well as
other species, such as gelatin, colloidal ferric oxide, and sodium oleate.16,17 On the basis of these studies, he proposed a varying

“water withdrawing eﬀect” of diﬀerent salts, which he tried to link directly to their salting out ability.16,17
Hofmeister’s (over)ambitious goal to rationalize speciﬁc ion eﬀects on general solutes in terms of the interactions of salt ions with water was subsequently adopted by proponents of the picture of “kosmotropes” and “chaotropes”.20,21 According to this view, the former group of ions, such as ﬂuoride or sulfate, bring order (kosmos) to the solution and can organize several layers of water molecules around themselves, eﬀectively “stealing” water from the solute, thus being eﬃcient for salting out. In contrast, the latter ions, like iodide, perchlorate, or thiocyanate, do not possess this ability and thus are not eﬀective salting out agents. This explanation of the Hofmeister phenomena is appealing because of its simplicity; however, it

brings in serious problems. First, a quick glance at the Hofmeister series (Figure 2) shows that while this rationalization might work for anions, it fails for cations. Indeed, it is the “chaotropic” cations like ammonium, which are on the salting out side of the series, and not the “kosmotropic” ones, like magnesium or calcium. Second, there is mounting experimental and computational evidence that even strongly hydrated ions at physiological (and higher) ionic strengths do not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence water beyond their immediate solvation shells.22−24 Therefore, the whole concept of “kosmotropes” and “chaotropes” may need to be set aside. Finally, Nature itself provides direct evidence that salting out behavior cannot be explained by considering ions and water only and that the protein solute needs to be brought explicitly into the picture. The most notable example in this respect is lysozyme, which salts out of solution according to the Hofmeister series only at basic pH values and high ionic strength, but follows a reversed series under neutral and acidic conditions up to moderate salt concentrations.25−27
The last point clearly demonstrates that not only the hydration properties of salt ions but also their interactions with protein surfaces need to be understood in order to rationalize the Hofmeister series. This has been recognized since the 1960s, and reductionist models of protein surface groups have been proposed for the interactions of salt ions in water probed by various thermodynamic and spectroscopic techniques.28−31 The picture emerging from these studies, which focused primarily on the protein backbone, is that the amide group interacts favorably with weakly hydrated anions (e.g., bromide, iodide, perchlorate, or thiocyanate) and, to a much lesser extent, with strongly hydrated cations (like lithium, magnesium, or calcium). It follows from simple thermodynamic considerations that attractive ion−backbone interactions lead to salting in (and destabilization) of the protein. This implies a weaker salting out (and stabilization) ability for ion more strongly partitioned to the protein surface,32 which puts the above results in accord with the Hofmeister series (Figure 2).
Recent work, for which the term “Renaissance for Hofmeister” has been coined,33 builds on the above pioneering studies and turns attention to the speciﬁc groups presented at protein surfaces. As such, a quantitative view of ion−protein interactions in aqueous solutions is beginning to take shape.4,9,13,32,34−45 In this Feature Article, our goal is to summarize the current understanding of the molecular origins of Hofmeister ordering for ions at protein surfaces and to link it to macroscopic behavior. At the same time, we explore the limitations of classifying salt eﬀects on proteins into separate anionic and cationic series and propose moving “Beyond Hofmeister”,13 in the direction of systematic investigations of speciﬁc ion eﬀects on biological function.
■ METHODOLOGY Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide insight into ion−protein interactions in aqueous solutions with unprecedented spatial (and temporal) resolution that is otherwise extremely diﬃcult to obtain by experiments alone. Indeed, MD simulations allow scientists to follow the motions of each individual atom of the system in detail.46,47 There are, however, two potential problems. The ﬁrst one concerns obtaining statistically signiﬁcant data. This is typically not a crucial issue in rather concentrated aqueous salt solutions (such as those of alkali cations corresponding to physiological conditions) where most ion−protein distributions

converge at computationally accessible submicrosecond time scales.48 Moreover, a reductionist approach allows us in many instances to work with small molecules carrying the crucial functional groups as proxies to larger proteins, which further simpliﬁes the calculations and speeds up convergence.44 The situation may be more complicated for more strongly binding polyvalent ions, such as calcium or magnesium. In these cases, convergence of ion−protein functional group interactions can be enhanced by moving to concentrations that are higher than those at standard physiological conditions and/or by employing dedicated free energy methods (such as umbrella sampling) rather than performing brute force direct simulations.49
The second issue concerns the accuracy of the interaction potentials employed for ions, water, and proteins when using common force ﬁelds. It is clear that the ﬁnal result can only be as good as the underlying potential. Standard nonpolarizable force ﬁelds often provide a satisfactory description of aqueous proteins and simple ions, such as sodium, potassium, or chloride. However, they tend to overestimate ion−protein and ion−peptide interactions for highly charged ions like divalent magnesium and calcium or trivalent lanthanides,50 while underestimating interactions with proteins or their proxies for soft (polarizable) anions, e.g., thiocyanate.44 Improvement can often be achieved by including electronic polarization eﬀects either explicitly by employing a polarizable force ﬁeld51 or implicitly by scaling the ionic charges and adjusting the ionic radii.52 In these more diﬃcult cases, it is particularly important to benchmark the results for model systems against structural experiments (such as neutron or X-ray scattering) and/or ab initio MD simulations explicitly treating the electronic structure.53 Luckily, it is now becoming computationally feasible to statistically converge interactions between biologically relevant ions and charged side chains or backbone groups in water by using density functional theory methods.54
Experimental Techniques. From the experimental point of view, a multi-instrumental approach (described in detail below) has been adopted to probe the three main components of the macromolecular interfaces the water molecules, the macromolecules, and the ions in solution. Macromolecular hydration and the speciﬁc changes caused by ion absorption were explored via vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS), along with ATR-FTIR and NMR techniques. The systems were tuned by systematically varying speciﬁc functional groups. Furthermore, the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of numerous thermoresponsive polymers and polypeptides was also investigated in order to understand the eﬀects of salts on macroscopic behavior. Thermodynamic information about the polymer transition process near the LCST was obtained by using diﬀerential scanning calorimetry55−57 and isothermal titration calorimetry.58
Probing Macromolecular Hydration: Vibrational Sum
Frequency Spectroscopy (VSFS) Measurements. A detailed description of the VSFS system, data ﬁtting, and analysis protocols can be found elsewhere.59−62 Brieﬂy, a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser was employed as the fundamental beam with an output power of 50 mJ with a 17 ps pulse duration. This fundamental beam passed through an optical path including an optical parametric generator/ampliﬁer (OPG/OPA) stage in which a 532 nm visible and a tunable infrared (2000− 4000 cm−1) beam were generated. On the basis of the dipole approximation, the spatially and temporarily overlapped beams generated a sum frequency signal that was surface-speciﬁc.63 Over the last three decades, this method has been used to

probe the vibrational spectrum of various interfaces including the air (or substrate or oil)/water64−66 and air/macromolecule/ water interfaces.45 The latter have been speciﬁcally exploited to probe Hofmeister eﬀects. Measurements were made as a
function of salt identity and concentration to achieve molecular level insights into ion−macromolecule interactions. In a typical experiment, model macromolecules were dissolved in aqueous
solution at the desired salt concentration and introduced into a
Langmuir trough. The hydrophobic moieties of the macro-
molecules partitioned to the air/water interface to form a Gibbs
monolayer and the VSFS spectrum of the air/macromolecule/ water interface were measured in the 2800−3800 cm−1 spectral window including the C−H, O−H, and N−H stretch modes
using the ssp polarization combination (s, sum frequency;
s, visible; p, infrared). Such a polarization combination provides
signal contributions for vibrational modes that oscillate parallel to the surface normal. Namely, the C−H modes pointing toward
the air and the aligned interfacial macromolecular hydration
water molecules were the main components of each spectrum. Such hydration layer-speciﬁc spectra are rich in information,
as shown in the Results and Discussion section. Moreover,
additional spectroscopic techniques like NMR were utilized to obtain site-speciﬁc information.
Probing Speciﬁc Moieties on Macromolecules: NMR and Attenuated Total Reﬂection (ATR)-FTIR. Two techniques have been used to probe speciﬁc chemical moieties on polypeptides/
acrylamide polymers. First, proton (H) NMR measurements
as a function of salt concentrations helped to elucidate ionspeciﬁc chemical shifts for C−H and N−H residues on
macromolecules. The details of these measurements can be found elsewhere.44 Brieﬂy, all spectra were acquired on a
400 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TXI probe at a temperature below the lower critical solution
temperature (LCST) of the thermoresponsive macromolecules.
For the chemical shift assignments of the desired macromolecules, 1H−1H NOESY and 1H−1H TOCSY were employed. The 1H NMR spectra were acquired using Watergate for water suppression67 for all experiments. It was also veriﬁed
that there were no measurable peak shifts as a result of this suppression proﬁle. Furthermore, sample solutions were
externally referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-
sulfonate in pure D2O. The chemical shift of each proton on the macromolecule was monitored as a function of both salt identity and concentration. This provided site-speciﬁc information on ion−macromolecule interactions. The change in the chemical shift with increasing salt concentration was ﬁt to an empirical
equation in the form of a linear term and a term containing a
Langmuir binding isotherm. In order to probe the amide oxygen for speciﬁc cation inter-
actions, an attenuated total reﬂection (ATR)-FTIR technique
was employed. The details of our ATR-FTIR system can be found elsewhere.68 In this case, a Nicolet 470 FTIR spectro-
meter was used, which was equipped with a Pike Miracle ATR
attachment containing a single-bounce ZnSe crystal. A liquid
nitrogen cooled MCT detector was utilized to measure the infrared signal. A sample spectrum was collected at 2 cm−1 resolution over a window from 1000 to 4000 cm−1. An otherwise identical salt solution was employed without the model
amide molecule, butyramide, to obtain background spectra. Protein/Polymer Solubility Measurements. Solubility meas-
urements were performed in order to probe the macroscopic
behavior of biomacromolecules, i.e., polymers/polypeptides, and
proteins. The LCST values of thermoresponsive polypeptides

and proteins were measured as a function of salt identity and concentration to explore ion-speciﬁc eﬀects. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)69−71 and poly(N,N-diethyl acrylamide) (PDEA),72 along with neutral44,73 and positively and negatively74 charged elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) and lysozyme,26 were utilized as model biomacromolecules. The salt-speciﬁc LCST
curves were modeled as a function of salt concentration by using
the following empirical equations:

T = T0 + c[M] +

Bmax [M ] KD + [M]

(1)

T = T0 + c[M] +

Bmax [M ]e−b[M ]k KD + [M]e−b[M]k

(2)

The ﬁrst equation models ion interactions with neutral bio-

macromolecules, while the second model also includes electro-

static charge neutralization interactions. These equations have a

linear term and a Langmuir binding isotherm where T0 is the phase transition temperature for the macromolecules in the

absence of any added salts and [M] is the molar salt concentration.

The constants Bmax and c have units of temperature (°C) and °C/[M], respectively. The Bmax constant denotes the maximum change in the LCST value upon ion binding, and c refers to the

linear portion of the change in the phase transition temperature. In

the second equation, the constant b has units of inverse molarity

and is related to the strength of the electrostatic interaction

between the charged macromolecules and the ions. It has been

observed phenomenologically that the constant, k, has a value

of 1 for anion binding to positively charged macromolecules and

2 for cation binding to negatively charged ones. These two

empirical equations have been shown to describe ion−macromolecule interactions rather well.26,74 The thermodynamic origins

of these models are discussed below.

Solution Theory and Thermodynamic Models. A complete

understanding of the eﬀects of salts on proteins not only

requires molecular insights, but also scale-bridging models that

allow one to connect microscopic interactions and structures

to measurable macroscopic observables, such as unfolding

(melting) temperatures or LCST values as well as solvation or

association free energies. To this end, the ﬂuctuation theory of solutions can be employed as a starting point.75−78 From this

bridges microscopic and thermodynamic behavior and thus

enables insights to be obtained from atomistic computer simula-

tions and macroscopic experiments. It has been shown recently that the connection to experi-

ments can be made in a direct way if the response of the twostate transition free energy ΔG(T) to the perturbation by salt is

evaluated in more detail close to the transition temperature of the pure water reference state.75,79 T0 is a constant deﬁned as
the temperature at which the populations of the two states are
equal to one another in the absence of salt, such that ΔG(T0) = ΔH0 − T0ΔS0 = 0, where ΔS0 is the transition entropy. A Taylor expansion of ΔG(T, cs) about this reference state
(i.e., temperature T0 and cs = 0 M) in the variables cs and T
leads to an explicit expression for the change in the transition temperature75

Of particular importance is the parameter m which is related to

the well-known “m-value” that has been traditionally used to describe linear cosolute eﬀects on protein unfolding, ΔGF↔U (cs) = ΔGFH↔2OU − mcs.80−83 The m-value is known to have a

negative value for stabilizing/salting out (i.e., from the protein-

surface-excluded) salts and a positive value for destabilizing/ salting in (i.e., protein-attracted) salts.80 Within our picture, m

describes linear changes for small cs while the parameter m′ accounts for higher-order nonlinear eﬀects of salts. Importantly,

through eq 3, both parameters are directly related to the simulation-accessible preferential binding coeﬃcient ΔΓ.75 ΔS′0
describes the eﬀect of the salt on the transition entropy. Due to

the symmetry of mixed derivatives in the Taylor expansion, the

latter is the same as the temperature derivative of parameter m.

We note that eq 4 is mathematically equivalent to eq 1,

which empirically combines a linear part with a Langmuir-type binding isotherm.70,84 Equation 4 can also be extended to

approximately include electrostatic interactions between the

ions and charged macromolecules in the limit of small charges and high screening,79 resulting in a diﬀerent form than eq 2.

The signiﬁcance of eq 4 is that we can now determine the

leading order thermodynamic coeﬃcients of salt-induced

changes by ﬁtting to experimental ΔT(cs) curves, e.g., via LCST data, and directly linking them through the preferential

binding parameter to microscopic ion−protein adsorption

structures, which are accessible through computer simulations.

Hence, this gets us closer to achieving a multiscale picture

of salt-induced eﬀects on macromolecular solubility and

stability, connecting microscopic structures to macroscopic

phase behavior.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Feature Article

Recent studies have demonstrated that the interactions of anions and cations with chemically diverse protein surface groups need to be individually considered and understood in order to rationalize the Hofmeister series.13 Such microscopic information is accessible by computer simulations based on physically reasonable and suﬃciently accurate force ﬁeld parameters, allowing for the experimental data to be rationalized consistently and with high information content. Moreover, although cationic and anionic eﬀects are often discussed separately, electroneutrality requires that the two types of ions have inseparable behavior on a global scale. Similarly, only the eﬀects for the whole protein (i.e., not individual surface patches) are measured in thermodynamic experiments. Nevertheless, such observations result from an interplay of individual local interactions, which calls for a detailed molecular level understanding of the dominant players.11,15,39 In the following discussion, we thus dissect the protein surface into its major building blocks that are relevant for salt−protein interactions. Namely, we consider the protein backbone, the negatively and positively charged side chains, as well as the hydrophobic and polar side chains.
This reductionist approach to ion−protein interactions builds upon earlier studies of ions at more homogeneous aqueous interfaces. After investigations of ions at the water/vapor and water/oil interfaces,85,86 more complex model surfaces were considered. In particular, considerable insight and generic rules were obtained via MD simulation studies of salt interactions with functionalized monolayers.11,15,87 Varying the surface charge and polarity, diﬀerent rank orderings have been found for cations and anions, providing a rationalization for the complexity of the Hofmeister series.11,15,87 These studies prove that ion-speciﬁcity appears even at more uniform surfaces containing the same functional groups present in proteins. In other words, Hofmeister ordering clearly persists beyond proteins, which were designed by natural selection over millions of years.
Ions at the Protein Backbone: Direct Hofmeister Series. Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The fact that proteins contain a wide range of sizes and shapes, and contain charged, polar, and hydrophobic side chain ratios, has led many researchers to assume that the Hofmeister ordering of ions may be driven by some universal and ubiquitous feature of proteins. A natural candidate is the peptide bond at the protein backbone. Indeed, both cations and anions follow the Hofmeister series at the peptide bond, which has been documented by a number of MD simulation studies of proteins,35,40 short peptides (such as triglycine),44,88,89 polymers/polypeptides PNIPAM, and ELPs,44 as well as by studies of small molecular systems such as N-methylacetamide (NMA).42,43 Speciﬁcally, weakly hydrated anions and strongly hydrated cations are attracted to the protein backbone. In general, interactions of anions like iodide, thiocyanate, and perchlorate with the NH end of the peptide bond, and the adjacent methylene groups, are found to be stronger than those of cations such as sodium, lithium, or calcium with the adjacent CO group.44
Experiments. Experimental techniques which work over a variety of length scales (both microscopic and macroscopic ones) are required to obtain a full molecular level picture of the inﬂuence of salt ions on biomacromolecules.44 First, the hydrocarbon protons on ELP (VPGVG)120 were monitored at each site with proton NMR as a function of salt concentration.

It was found that only the weakly hydrated anions (SCN− and I−) inﬂuenced the chemical shifts in a nonmonotonic fashion and only for protons on carbons adjacent to electron withdrawing groups. The most favorable interactions on polypeptide backbones occurred for a hybrid binding site that consisted of the amide nitrogen and the adjacent α-carbon. The apparent dissociation constants (KD’s), achieved from the nonlinear change in the chemical shifts, were shown to be as tight as 50 mM between a thiocyanate anion and this site (see Figure 3A). The reason is that the CH moieties for these α-carbon positions maintained a partial positive charge, which led to the binding of weakly hydrated anions. By contrast, the hydrophobic side chains of isopropyl groups of the valine residues did not show any anion binding. In thermodynamic measurements, the KD values found with these polymers (e.g., ELPs, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), or poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide)) are typically hundreds of millimolar, which necessarily represents an average over the varying sites on the macromolecules.44,62,69,70,72,73,82,87 Interestingly, the presence of a partially positively charged hydrogen from the amide N−H groups is not required for this binding to occur, although they may slightly contribute when present.72

Ion-speciﬁc eﬀects at the protein backbone were also examined at the air/biomacromolecule/water interface via vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy. In these studies, ELP (VPGVG)120 and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), see insets of Figure 3A,B, were employed as model macromolecules, and the vibrational resonances of the interfacial water molecules were probed. Figure 3B plots the vibrational spectra of a Gibbs monolayer for PNIPAM in the presence of 1 M sodium salts. Signiﬁcantly, a substantial enhancement in the oscillator strength of the water OH stretch bands (3200 and 3400 cm−1) in the VSFS experiments was observed upon the introduction of weakly hydrated anions. Such an increase followed a direct anionic Hofmeister series for the air/PNIPAM/water interface. This signal is direct evidence of anionic absorption to the macromolecules over the sodium countercations, which leads to an alignment of interfacial water molecules with respect to the surface normal and, in turn, shows a rise in the VSFS signal.59,61 The change in the VSFS OH stretch spectrum upon the addition of strongly hydrated anions was much smaller, which is evidence that these anions are not preferentially partitioned to the interface. The ion-speciﬁc trends obtained from the interfacial water signal are in agreement with the idea that weakly

thermodynamically relevant.

hydrated anions partition to an interface containing an amide moiety, much like the backbone of proteins.
Cation interactions with amide moieties were also explored employing the small molecule of butyramide (inset in Figure 3C). A series of aqueous metal chloride salt solutions were employed in combination with ATR-FTIR to monitor the contact pair formation between the metal cations and the amide oxygen. Figure 3C shows ATR-FTIR spectra of butyramide in the amide I region, in the absence and presence of 5 M salt concentrations. No apparent change in the amide I band (1620 cm−1) could be seen in the presence of weakly hydrated cations even with 5 M concentration of their chloride salts (Figure 3C, parts i and ii, compare no salt with 5 M NaCl). In sharp contrast, molar concentrations of more strongly hydrated cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Li+) gave rise to a new peak at 1645 cm−1, assigned to metal cation-contact-pair bound amides (data with 5 M CaCl2 in Figure 3C, part iii). Note that this binding is relatively weak and that only 30% of the binding sites are occupied in salt solutions even at 5 M CaCl2, which is near the salt solubility limit. As such, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants should be no tighter than ∼8.5 M.45
In a complementary set of experiments, the interactions of cations with amide moieties were investigated at the air/ butyramide/water interface via VSFS. Such experiments were sensitive to the interfacial cation partitioning for not only contact pair formation, but also solvent shared and solvent separated pairs. Figure 3D displays VSFS spectra in the CH and OH stretch regions for interfacial butyramide molecules and their adjacent water structure in the presence of various metal chloride salts in the subphases. The sharp vibrational resonances in the 2800−3000 cm−1 region are from the CH stretch bands of the butyramide molecule, while the broader bands in the higher-frequency region come from NH and OH stretches. Speciﬁcally, the water OH stretch peak (3200 cm−1) was strongly enhanced by the preferential binding of strongly hydrated cations, whereas this same peak remained essentially unchanged for the chloride salts of weakly hydrated cations. This data suggested that only strongly hydrated cations have

preferential absorption over their respective counteranion.45 Thus, the hydration data is in good agreement with a direct cationic Hofmeister series. The data from Figure 3B,D, for anions and cations, respectively, demonstrate that weakly hydrated anions bind tighter than strongly hydrated cations to interfaces with amide moieties. Interestingly, this is not necessarily the case for small molecules, such as NMA or triglycine, where cation binding is often found to be stronger.88,90,91
Although cationic aﬃnities to the peptide bond were found to be relatively weak compared to anion binding, they may play a role in aﬀecting the stability of secondary structure elements of proteins, such as α-helices or β-sheets, where the ions and water molecules compete with intrachain backbone hydrogen bonds. Structural stabilities of oligopeptides of various polarity, ranging from hydrophobic,92 over neutral but polar, to highly charged,93,94 and of complex compositions (AK,95,96 AE,97 EK,95,98 polyGLU93,94,96) were studied in diﬀerent salt solutions. This allowed ion−peptide interaction motifs and binding kinetics (retention times, etc.)96,99 to be related to macroscopic observables, such as folding times and helical stabilities. Computational predictions for Hofmeister ordering of ion eﬀects on the structural stability of oligopeptides were also supported by direct spectroscopic evidence from circulardichroism (CD) and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements.100
Thermodynamic Modeling. As illustrated above, several model compounds can be used as proxies for the protein backbone. The thermoresponsive polymer PNIPAM is one of the most widely used examples. Equation 4 was employed to analyze the thermodynamic equilibrium and the preferential binding of salts, with the focus on cations, to PNIPAM.43,57,70,71,75 Cations, typically as chloride salts, are mostly found to decrease the LCST in a linear fashion as a function of salt concentration. The corresponding thermodynamic analysis shows the lowering of the transition free energy with salt concentration, in quantitative accord with calorimetry experiments,55−57 together with a stronger salt depletion from

the swollen state.75 It is generally observed that strongly
hydrated cations are preferentially excluded from the PNIPAM surface.29,41,43,70 As seen from the radial distribution func-
tion between the PNIPAM monomer and the ions from Na2SO4 (see Figure 4), this is reﬂected by an ion-depleted zone close to the monomer. Analogous results were found for
strongly hydrated ions near the methyl group of PNIPAM and NMA.42,44
The existence of a depletion zone for salt ions next to the polymer enables the building of a simpliﬁed semiquantitative
thermodynamic model. Starting with a salt inaccessible (but water-accessible) volume ΔV(cs, T), the accompanying free energy change paid for the transfer of ions from water to the salt solution can be expressed as ΔΔG ≅ kBTcsΔV.75 Using an approximate surface area for the N-isopropylacrylamide monomer of 100 Å2 and a depletion layer thickness of 1 Å, the model predicts a negative coeﬃcient m = −kBTΔV on the order of −100 kJ mol−1 m3, which is consistent with literature
m-values (or, in older notation, transfer free energies) for strongly hydrated ions.9,28,29,101
The aﬃnity patterns of anions for the peptide bond are more
complex compared to those of cations. Unlike the cationic case,
the m-parameter for weakly hydrated anions (i.e., their sodium salts), which denotes nonlinear eﬀects, is nonvanishing.70,75
Although the LCST curves start at the origin in a linear fashion,
the deviation from linearity already shows up at very low salt concentrations (cs ≃ 50 mM).75 For the most weakly hydrated

anions, the initial slope is even positive (that is, yielding a positive parameter m before the LCST turns over at a maximum to a negative slope ΔT′(c) < 0), implying a stronger adsorption (or lesser exclusion) to the extended versus the collapsed states at small salt concentrations.75 The turnover eﬀect is the strongest for NaClO4 where the maximum of the LCST curve was found at about c ≃ 50 mM. Thus, a more complex model is needed to ﬁt the data for the anion series, compared to the simple excluded volume approach applicable for cations. Thermodynamic analysis of PNIPAM shows that the parameter m′ is always negative, which can be interpreted as a weakened attraction of anions for the PNIPAM surface with increasing salt concentration. On a microscopic level, this may be attributed to slow but gradual charging of the PNIPAM surface (and/or its vicinity) due to the excess partitioning of anions (NaSCN in Figure 4). In this way, the buildup of repulsive electrostatic interactions causes the binding of anions to become anticooperative at higher concentrations.
Cations at Negatively Charged Side Chains: Direct Hofmeister Series. Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Our early simulation study on interactions of sodium and potassium ions with soluble proteins showed that cations follow the Hofmeister series both at the backbone and at negatively charged side chains of glutamates and aspartates.35 These calculations also demonstrated that cationic interactions with the anionic side chain groups at the protein surface are stronger than those with the backbone. Subsequent studies,

In the right column, we present the thermodynamic preferential binding coeﬃcient Γ evaluated in regions adjacent to the three methylene groups (see inset and legend).

which reduced the problem of cationic aﬃnities to acidic side chains of proteins to interactions of ions with glutamate and aspartate amino acids or even with the carboxylic group of model compounds like acetate or formate, further systematized and experimentally veriﬁed the early computational predictions.38,40,42,95,96,102 In a nutshell, cations order according to the Hofmeister series at the aqueous COO− group with strongly hydrated ions such as sodium, lithium, or calcium forming stronger ion pairs than weakly hydrated ions like potassium, ammonium, or cesium. Pairing of divalent and trivalent cations with the carboxylic group is suﬃciently strong that it can lead to overcharging of short oligoaspartates in aqueous solutions, as demonstrated by MD simulations and electrophoretic measurements.50
Experiments. Speciﬁc cation eﬀects were also probed at net negatively charged polypeptides by monitoring the phase transition temperature of ELPs containing aspartic acid residues that were deprotonated under the conditions of the experiments.74 Figure 5A,C plots the LCST of the polypeptide as a function of concentration for chloride salts of monovalent and divalent cations. The data were ﬁt to an empirical equation that consists of a linear term and a modiﬁed Langmuir binding isotherm which accounts for electrostatic interactions (eq 2). Divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, and Zn2+) resulted in a sharp decay in the LCST due to electrostatic screening and ion pairing between the negatively charged aspartate groups and

the divalent cations. Such interactions resulted in apparent KD values that were found in the low millimolar range for all tested divalent cations. The eﬀects of monovalent cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+, NMe4+) were approximately 2 orders of magnitude weaker with shallower decay trends observed (Figure 5A). Furthermore, these cation binding aﬃnities to
the macromolecules were in agreement with a direct cationic Hofmeister series.74
Thermodynamic Modeling. Above, we described a model that accounts for cation-speciﬁcity at the neutral protein
backbone, where salting out could be attributed to cationspeciﬁc depleted volume eﬀects. Proteins are weakly charged
macromolecules with charge fraction (i.e., ratio of total charge
vs number of amino acids or monomers) typically below 10%.103 For such systems, the two-state thermodynamic model,
eq 4, of the folded/unfolded equilibrium has been extended to the case where the polymer is weakly charged.79 Here, we include nonspeciﬁc electrostatic eﬀects via a Donnan potential, but explicitly account for the salt-speciﬁcity deﬁned above. The
model was tested for a weakly (positively) charged PNIPAM-
copolymer up to a charge fraction of 5% in NaBr solution.
Moreover, our theory was further applied in this work to analyze the eﬀects of the alkali-chloride salts on the LCST of
the weakly charged elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) plotted in
Figure 5B. Decomposing the total LCST change into two
contributions, it was found that for monovalent cations the

electrostatic contribution can be modeled as a combination

of a nonspeciﬁc dominant response (responsible for ∼35 K

decrease of the LCST), and a “softer” cation-speciﬁc eﬀect

contributing around ∼10 K/M. Moreover, it was found that the

cation-speciﬁc eﬀects were virtually the same as in the neutral

ELP reference; i.e., the cations follow a direct Hofmeister

series. We note that more advanced electrostatic descriptions,

as well as couplings with speciﬁc polymer shapes, are available in principle.104 These, however, necessarily lead to mathemati-

cally much more complex expressions and would only provide

smaller improvements.

Anions at Positively Charged Side Chains: Reversed

Hofmeister Series. Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Be-

sides the protein backbone, the obvious hot spots at the protein

surface for interactions with anions are the positively charged

side chains of arginine, lysine, and (doubly protonated)

histidine. While nature operates with only a single anionic side chain group (COO−), there are instead three cationic

side chain groups: guanidinium, ammonium, and imidazolium.

MD simulations of aqueous proteins/peptides, as well as single

amino acids or molecular ions carrying these cationic groups,

show that interactions with anions are governed by a reversed

Hofmeister series (see Figure 6 for ordering of anions at the ammonium group at the N-terminal of triglycine).41,98 In other

words, unlike at the protein backbone, it is the strongly hydrated

anions like ﬂuoride or sulfate which dominate at positively

charged side chains over weakly hydrated anions like iodide,

perchlorate, or thiocyanate. As discussed in more detail below,

this anionic behavior at positively charged side chains makes

the ion-speciﬁcity of anions richer than that of cations and is

responsible for the occurrence of a Hofmeister reversal as observed for some cationic proteins like lysozyme.25,26

Experiments. In analogy to the previous experimental

section, the eﬀect of Hofmeister anions on polypeptides with

positively charged residues was experimentally investigated as

a function of salt concentration by monitoring the LCST of an

ELP containing 16 lysine residues. In this case, about 3% of the

amino acids were positively charged. The other 97% consisted

of valine, glycine, and proline residues. These data could also

be modeled with eq 2, and anions are expected to interact

strongly with the polymer surface. At low salt concentrations, a

sharp decay in the LCST curves was observed that corresponds

to the electrostatic charge neutralization for all tested weakly

hydrated anions (Figure 5D). This relative eﬀectiveness of

anions to salting out the positively charged ELPs reﬂects a

electrostatic charge neutralization showed a strong correla-

tion with the partial molar volume of the Hofmeister anions

(Figure 5D, inset). Strikingly, at higher salt concentrations, the salt eﬀect reverted to a direct Hofmeister series Cl− > NO3− > ClO4− > Br− > I− > SCN−. The ion-speciﬁc trends at higher salt concentrations (>0.2 M) correlated with the values of salt

eﬀect on the surface tension at the air/water interface. Namely,

the positively charged ELPs salt in with more weakly hydrated

anions (i.e., NaSCN and NaI), whereas the same ELPs salt out

when more strongly hydrated anions such as NaCl, NaNO3, and NaBr were introduced. This higher salt concentration

behavior mirrors our results with neutral ELPs and polymers.

Moreover, the Hofmeister series reversal has been found

in other systems as well. For instance, the protein−protein

aggregation behavior of lysozyme with salts of weakly hydrated

anions were shown to demonstrate very similar behavior to that

of positively charged ELPs,26 with diﬀerent mechanisms at low

and high salt concentrations. More recently, other reversed

Hofmeister series have also been reported, i.e., for the anion

association to the N-terminus of uncapped triglycine oligopeptides.88,96

Thermodynamic Modeling. The electrostatic contribution

can be introduced analogously as in the case of cations, i.e., at

the nonspeciﬁc Donnan electrostatic potential level. To test this

approach, we again employed the weakly charged elastin-like

polypeptide (KV6, i.e., with low content of lysine residues), for

which anion-speciﬁc eﬀects on the experimental LCST were analyzed using data in Figure 5D.74 The results of this analysis

can be summarized showing that a dominant contribution

originates from electrostatic screening. A smaller contribution,

however, stems from strongly anion-speciﬁc interactions with

the ELP, which are generally more pronounced than those of

the cations (as discussed above). Due to the small fraction

of lysine residues, this anion-speciﬁc contribution does not

cause the full reversal of the Hofmeister series at this level of

description.

For peptides with surfaces of high charge density, such as

polyARG, the Donnan description is no longer applicable. In this case, Bjerrum theory,50,105 which phenomenologically

describes counterion complexation, or the more advanced Manning condensation model102,106 can be employed for non-

speciﬁc screening of highly charged surfaces by singly or

multiply charged ions. The remaining eﬀect is due to ion-speciﬁc

interactions (analogous to the weakly charged ELP) with the

highly charged surface created by the charged functional groups

on the amino acid side chains (i.e., −NH3+ or −Gnd+). Here, the reversal of the Hofmeister series is recovered for anions of

polyARG.

Eﬀects of Cations and Anions at Hydrophobic and

Polar Surface Groups. The eﬀect of Hofmeister anions at

hydrophobic surfaces were elucidated in several diﬀerent contexts including at the air/water,85 oil/water,107−109 and related hydrophobic surfaces.91,110 In these reports, the most

weakly hydrated anions were found to absorb to a variety of

liquid interfaces and alter the adjacent water structure under

most conditions. Measurements on negatively charged, hydro-

phobic surfaces were made with VSFS on negatively charged

silica surfaces covered with a monolayer of octadecyl trichlorosilane (OTS) molecules.111 Such an interface can

serve as a model system for hydrophobic patches located in the

vicinity of anionic residues. As can be seen in Figure 7A, the

stretch of the

OTS monolayer along with the hydration water signal (3200 and 3400 cm−1). The sodium salts of more weakly hydrated

anions (NaSCN or NaClO4) enhanced the water ordering due to anion adsorption. Salts of less weakly hydrated anions

(NaNO3, NaBr, or NaCl), in contrast, suppress the water signal via a screening eﬀect. Indeed, one would expect better sodium

partitioning to the negatively charged surface compared to a generic anion. However, Na+ is relatively well-hydrated and

cannot interact as strongly with the negatively charged surface as SCN− and ClO4−, which can more easily shed their hydration shells at the interface, as illustrated in Figure 7B. As

a consequence, the surface potential actually becomes more

negative when low concentrations of weakly hydrated anions

are introduced. Overall, a direct Hofmeister series is obeyed in terms of the attenuation of the water structure as Cl− > Br− > NO3− > ClO4− > SCN−.

In MD simulations of short alanine based helix forming peptides it has been observed that I− has considerable aﬃnity for the nonpolar alanine.95,98 This is in line with the recent observations of a large propensity of I− to adsorb to simple hydrophobes and thereby appeared to “assist” Na+ in its destabilizing action of the helical structure.95,98 The larger ions ClO4− and Gnd+ were also found to have a propensity to favorably interact with the hydrophobic methyl group of the ALA side chain.100 The I− aﬃnity to alanine was enhanced for the positively charged (AK)6. However, the helix destabilization eﬀect by NaI for this peptide was found to be much weaker compared to the negatively charged (AE)6 due to the (electrostatically induced) depletion of Na+ at the peptide backbone. This demonstrated that I− alone was not responsible for denaturation, but rather assisted and ampliﬁed cationic action. This exempliﬁed the synergetic mechanisms behind speciﬁc ion-induced (de)stabilization of protein secondary structures and its sensitive dependence on local value and sign of the charge on the peptide.
Already the early simulation studies of proteins in aqueous solutions of simple salts showed that the remaining parts of the protein surface, i.e., polar and hydrophobic amino acid groups, do not strongly attract ions.35,112,113 Therefore, these regions do not contribute signiﬁcantly to the preferential binding of salts to the protein surface when compared to the charged side chains and the backbone. Nevertheless, hydrophobic surface groups can contribute to salt exclusion, and in general, these interactions may be characterized in terms of a direct or reversed Hofmeister series depending on the combination of surface polarity and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity employed.11,15,87
■ BEYOND HOFMEISTER Beyond Separate Cationic and Anionic Series. Global salt and cosolvent eﬀects have been widely investigated in considerable detail. These studies have addressed solubilities, cloudpoint temperatures and equilibrium constants (i.e., transition free energies, ΔG) of biomolecules.9,28,29,70,73,77,80−82,89,101 Despite the diversity of these studies and the various speciﬁc salt eﬀects that were found, only a limited number of physical scenarios seem to be relevant on a macroscopic level. In the vast

majority of experiments, linear changes in the thermodynamic properties with salt concentration were found, often up to surprisingly high concentrations. This linear behavior provides justiﬁcation for the m-value description and the transfer models introduced in the 1960s.77,80−82,114,115
Less frequently, nonlinearities in biomolecular thermodynamic quantities as functions of concentration of salts (e.g., in T0(c), ΔG(c), K(c), etc.) due to the addition of salts or cosolvents were reported at higher concentrations (c > 4 M). Such nonlinearities were believed to originate from solution nonideality.77,80,116 Qualitatively diﬀerent nonlinearities (again in Tm(c), ΔG(c), or K(c)) due to the addition of salts may appear in the submolar salt concentration range.70,117,73,118 In this case, the thermodynamic properties are nonmonotonic in c, which are signiﬁed, e.g., by a re-entrant collapse transition (at ﬁxed temperature) of the polymer, undergoing a collapsed → swollen → collapsed transition with increasing cosolvent concentration. These cases were reported only recently for the action of weakly hydrated anions, such as ClO4−, SCN−, or I−, on thermoresponsive polymers.70,73,117 Note that a similar co-nonsolvency eﬀect119 can also be observed in polymer solubility in mixed solvents (e.g., water/methanol) under some conditions,120 where the polymer is completely soluble in the pure solvents, but not in their mixtures.56,119−122
A uniﬁed model of salt eﬀects on protein stability, covering these three main regimes during the re-entrant transitions, was established recently by coarse-grained simulations, Flory theory, and simple statistical mechanics considerations.123 Figure 8A−E summarizes and illustrates the diﬀerent levels of description of the three distinct regimes of the concentration dependent cosolvent (e.g., salt) action, found in ternary solutions (i.e., containing biomolecules in water and salt). These follow: (i) There is collapse due to depletion (exclusion). Under conditions where the cosolvent (e.g., Na2SO4) is depleted, the state of the polymer with a smaller exposed surface area is preferred. (ii) There is swelling due to weak attraction (weak binding). In contrast, in the weakly attractive regime (e.g., for GndCl or urea), the state of the polymer with the larger exposed surface area is preferred. In these cases the cosolvent eﬀect on ΔG(c) is linear.70,73,75 This situation can be well-described by m-value-type models, and the transition thermodynamics is similar to that in neat water. This is related to the fact that these cases are essentially weak perturbations from neat water conditions. (iii) There is collapse and re-entrant swelling due to strong attraction (strong binding). For certain cosolutes (such as ClO4−, I−, SCN−), the binding at the polymer surface is relatively strong, but decreases with the concentration of the cosolute.70,73,75 This eﬀectively leads to the opening up of larger polymer surface areas at low salt concentrations and to collapsed states at higher salt concentration. This behavior was captured in calorimetry experiments55−57 as well as in MD studies. In this strongly binding (“bridging” or “weak cross-linking”) regime,123 the addition of cosolvent leads to tightly collapsed polymer states, maximizing contacts of monomers and cosolvent due to enthalpic reasons, at low cosolvent concentrations. The same enthalpic gain leads to polymer swelling at high cosolvent concentrations.123 This happens due to the fact that the extended polymer conformation provides more exposed surface area for interactions, which is also entropically favorable in terms of exchange of nearby cosolvent molecules.
The thermodynamic expansion model75 can be further used to interpret these results. The description by the thermodynamic model, as shown in Figure 8A−C, provides the eﬀects of

salt depletion, weak adsorption, and strong bridging on the polymer thermodynamics parameters, such as transition enthalpy, measured in calorimetry studies.56 It also provides preferential binding coeﬃcients, measurable in ﬁelds such as dialysis and accessible via computer simulations (Figure 8C). The coarsegrained simulations,121,123 converging the average knowledge gained from all-atom simulations,40,41,43,44,112 allow one not only to assess the stability of polymer chains in diﬀerent cosolvent regimes but also to extract the excess adsorption of the cosolvent molecules as well as thermodynamic features. Consequently, the trends in experimental data can be quantitatively analyzed and the corresponding microscopic details revealed.117,123
Speciﬁc Binding Sites. So far, we have mainly discussed ion interaction with biomacromolecules and small molecules containing amide bonds. Clearly, the role of ions in biology is far richer and more complex with large concentration gradients often existing across the lipid membrane. For example, the concentration of K+ in the cytoplasm is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than its concentration in the extracellular

ﬂuid, while the reverse is true for Na+. Such a strong gradient is not due to a Hofmeister eﬀect, as the diﬀerence in the ion pairing interactions for these ions with charged carboxylic acid groups, phosphate groups, or neutral protein backbones is only very modest, but rather due to the action of specialized ion pumps and channels. However, the coordination number diﬀerences of these cations within ion channels or other specialized binding sites are often signiﬁcant. It has been demonstrated that the coordination number for cations plays a crucial role in ion channel selectivity and can account for the signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the interactions of K+ or Na+ with these biological entities.124−126 In fact, the very existence of these specialized sites can override Hofmeister eﬀects. This is responsible for many of the ion selective behaviors observed in cells. In other words, while Hofmeister series eﬀects are always present as a background, they can be overridden by steric arrangements of speciﬁc chemical sites.
The behavior of divalent alkali earth cations and, in particular, transition metal ions is very diﬀerent from that of monovalent alkali metal cations. Magnesium, calcium, zinc, and divalent ions formed from ﬁrst row transition metal elements are exploited in numerous metalloproteins and serve as the basis for a myriad of catalysts and structural elements. Such transition metal cations are distinct from Hofmeister ions in that they can form coordination complexes in which substantial charge is transferred between the metal center and the binding ligand. These interactions often lead to much tighter bindings than those of Hofmeister-type ion pairing, and diﬀerent rules apply. The generic ion-speciﬁcity for ﬁrst row transition metal ions to amines and thiols in coordination complexes follows a distinct rank ordering of behavior, which is called the Irving−Williams series and is listed as follows:127
Mn2+ < Fe2+ < Co2+ < Ni2+ < Cu2+ > Zn2+
The main driving force in the Irving−Williams series is the charge transfer between the transition metal center and its ligands, which reaches a maximum for Ni2+ and Cu2+, but is weaker for the ions to their left. Zn2+ also shows much less charge transfer because it possesses ﬁlled d orbitals and is, therefore, technically not a transition metal. It should be noted that the ﬁrst row transition metals can also follow a Hofmeister series when charge transfer processes with ligands, such as amines or thiols, are not involved.
■ CONCLUSIONS
Molecular simulations together with spectroscopic and thermodynamic experiments have allowed us to understand the basic principles that govern the interactions of ions with proteins in aqueous solutions leading to salting out and salting in eﬀects. The gist of Hofmeister eﬀects, i.e., the ordering of ions according to their ability to salt out proteins, lies in local interactions at their surfaces. Straightforward thermodynamic reasoning leads to the notion that the more strongly attracted anion is to a protein in solution, the less eﬃcient it is in its salting out and vice versa. In particular, the crucial regions of protein surfaces interacting with ions are the backbone and charged side chains, with polar and hydrophobic side chains playing a much smaller role. Both simulations and experiments conﬁrm that cations follow standard Hofmeister ordering with strongly hydrated cations interacting more strongly and thus being less eﬃcient in salting out than weakly hydrated ones. This is true both at the protein backbone and at negatively

charged side chains, with the former interactions being signiﬁcantly weaker than the latter. The picture for anions is more complex with backbone and side chain interactions being oppositely ordered. At the backbone, they follow the normal anionic Hofmeister series with weakly hydrated anions interacting more strongly and thus being less eﬃcient in salting out than strongly hydrated ones. However, at the positively charged side chains, the anionic ordering is reversed. As a result of the above considerations, cations follow the Hofmeister series for protein salting out behavior, while for anions this is true only for proteins where the backbone eﬀect is stronger than that of the positively charged side chains. For strongly positively charged proteins such as lysozyme at low to neutral pH values, the anions can actually follow a reversed Hofmeister series.
No matter how powerful they appear to be, the Hofmeister rules governing protein salting out/salting in and their molecular rationalizations are only of an approximate nature. The ﬁrst and foremost approximation lies in separating the eﬀects of ions of opposite polarities into distinct cationic and anionic series. This is not the full story since ions interact with their counterions both in the bulk solution and at the surfaces of proteins. Beyond the need to satisfy the electroneutrality condition in both environments, there may be particularly strong cation−anion interactions for speciﬁc salts that render the separate treatment of cations and anions in the Hofmeister series questionable. For example, guanidinium is known to interact strongly with proteins in its most common chloride salt. Such cation−protein interactions can be, however, signiﬁcantly diminished for guanidinium when paired with sulfate. In other words, it is not only the interaction of a given ion with the protein surface that must be considered, but also its interactions with counterions.
The importance of the Hofmeister series goes beyond salting out of proteins, which is just one macroscopic manifestation of ion-speciﬁc eﬀects. The complementary process of salting in is intimately connected with protein (de)stabilization and denaturation, which remains a major scientiﬁc and technological challenge. Next, there is a plethora of biological functions that are controlled by ions, ranging from homeostasis and calcium signaling, to key roles of speciﬁc cations in metalloproteins. Most of these processes go beyond generic Hofmeister interactions and involve speciﬁc steric arrangements, e.g., in active sites of enzymes. The question that poses itself, motivating further research, is as follows: How much does nature exploit Hofmeister eﬀects in biological function and to what extent does it overrule them via forming speciﬁc binding sites?
