INCYLINDER
	This is part of the multicolvar module

This quantity can be used to calculate functions of the distribution of collective variables for the atoms that lie in a particular, user-specified part of of the cell.

Each of the base quantities calculated by a multicolvar can can be assigned to a particular point in three dimensional space. For example, if we have the coordination numbers for all the atoms in the system each coordination number can be assumed to lie on the position of the central atom. Because each base quantity can be assigned to a particular point in space we can calculate functions of the distribution of base quantities in a particular part of the box by using:

s ⎯ ⎯ τ = ∑ i f ( s i ) σ ( r x y ) ∑ i σ ( r x y )

where the sum is over the collective variables, s i , each of which can be thought to be at ( x i , y i , z i ) . The function σ is a switchingfunction that acts on the distance between the point at which the collective is located ( x i , y i , z i ) and the position of the atom that was specified using the ORIGIN keyword projected in the xy plane if DIRECTION=z is used. In other words:

r x y = s q r t ( x i − x 0 ) 2 + ( y i − y 0 ) 2

In short this function, σ ( r x y ) , measures whether or not the CV is within a cylinder that runs along the axis specified using the DIRECTION keyword and that is centered on the position of the atom specified using ORIGIN.

The function ( s i ) can be any of the usual LESS_THAN, MORE_THAN, WITHIN etc that are used in all other multicolvars.

When INCYLINDER is used with the DENSITY action the number of atoms in the specified region is calculated

Examples

The input below can be use to calculate the average coordination numbers for those atoms that are within a cylindrical tube of radius 1.5 nm that is centered on the position of atom 101 and that has its long axis parallel to the z-axis.

Glossary of keywords and components

Description of components

When the label of this action is used as the input for a second you are not referring to a scalar quantity as you are in regular collective variables. The label is used to reference the full set of quantities calculated by the action. This is usual when using MultiColvar functions . Generally when doing this the previously calculated multicolvar will be referenced using the DATA keyword rather than ARG.

This Action can be used to calculate the following scalar quantities directly. These quantities are calculated by employing the keywords listed below. These quantities can then be referenced elsewhere in the input file by using this Action's label followed by a dot and the name of the quantity. Some of them can be calculated multiple times with different parameters. In this case the quantities calculated can be referenced elsewhere in the input by using the name of the quantity followed by a numerical identifier e.g. label .lessthan-1, label .lessthan-2 etc. When doing this and, for clarity we have made it so that the user can set a particular label for each of the components. As such by using the LABEL keyword in the description of the keyword input you can customize the component name
Quantity 	Keyword 	Description
vmean 	VMEAN 	the norm of the mean vector. The output component can be referred to elsewhere in the input file by using the label.vmean
between 	BETWEEN 	the number/fraction of values within a certain range. This is calculated using one of the formula described in the description of the keyword so as to make it continuous. You can calculate this quantity multiple times using different parameters.
lessthan 	LESS_THAN 	the number of values less than a target value. This is calculated using one of the formula described in the description of the keyword so as to make it continuous. You can calculate this quantity multiple times using different parameters.
mean 	MEAN 	the mean value. The output component can be referred to elsewhere in the input file by using the label.mean
morethan 	MORE_THAN 	the number of values more than a target value. This is calculated using one of the formula described in the description of the keyword so as to make it continuous. You can calculate this quantity multiple times using different parameters.
