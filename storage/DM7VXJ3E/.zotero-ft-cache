Protein aggregation results in -sheet–like assemblies that adopt either a variety of amorphous morphologies or ordered amyloid-like structures. These differences in structure also reflect biological differences; amyloid and amorphous -sheet aggregates have different chaperone affinities, accumulate in different cellular locations and are degraded by different mechanisms. Further, amyloid function depends entirely on a high intrinsic degree of order. Here we experimentally explored the sequence space of amyloid hexapeptides and used the derived data to build Waltz, a web-based tool that uses a position-specific scoring matrix to determine amyloid-forming sequences. Waltz allows users to identify and better distinguish between amyloid sequences and amorphous -sheet aggregates and allowed us to identify amyloid-forming regions in functional amyloids.
The most common mechanism by which proteins aggregate consists of the incorporation of relatively short sequence segments into β-sheet–like assemblies1,2. Although enrichment in β-sheet structure is almost always observed3,4, aggregates display very disparate macro­ scopic structures5. Most proteins form amorphous aggregates that are characterized by a lack of regular three-dimensional structure. Under physiologically relevant conditions, however, several proteins aggregate into fibrillar amyloids6. As with all self-assembly processes, these differences in macromolecular structure reflect differences in packing and molecular structure at the atomic level7. These structural differences also reflect biological differences. Whereas misfolded and aggregated proteins are found in perinuclear locations and are generally degraded by the protea­somal system8,9, amyloids preferentially accumulate in perivacuolar inclusions, where they are degraded by the autophagosome10. This segregation directly results from a differential recognition by the protein quality control system10. A reduced affinity of amyloids for the protein quality control system is probably also at the root of their higher toxicity11 as artificial overexpression of chaperones usually leads to decreased toxicity and removal of amyloids from

the cell12. Contrary to amorphous aggregates, amyloid structures can fulfill biological functions, and functional amyloids are found in organisms from prokaryotes to humans13.
The amyloid conformation reflects an intrinsic conformational propensity of polypeptides as many proteins can be forced into amyloid fibrils by manipulating external conditions. However, amyloid formation is also a sequence-specific process14,15. Under physiological conditions, most peptide sequences derived from proteins will remain soluble even at high concentrations, whereas most hydrophobic sequences will invariably aggregate as amorphous aggregates. The first steps toward understanding the sequence-specific determinants of amyloid structure had been made by analyzing the first microcrystal structures of peptides from amyloid peptides16,17 and with the observation that protein aggregation correlates with simple biophysical parameters18. This triggered the development of several algorithms for predicting aggregation19–27. However, owing to the relatively small amount and diversity of experimentally validated amyloidogenic sequences, sequence-based prediction algorithms do not possess sufficient information to distinguish amyloid from amorphous aggregates. They generally also have rather poor predictive capabilities toward amyloid sequences from yeast prions and functional amyloids. In contrast, structure-based homology modeling methods25,40 can in principle provide very specific predictions. However, as side-chain modeling is very sensitive to even modest changes in backbone conformation, structure-based approaches are also limited by a shortage of experimentally determined structures28.
To better understand the sequence determinants of amyloid structure, we explored the sequence diversity of amyloid hexapeptides by inspecting more than 200 peptides using various structural and biophysical methods. Using these data we trained a web-based tool called Waltz, which allows users to explore the sequence space of amyloids. Our analysis highlighted the strong position-specific tendencies of the different amino acids for forming amyloid structures observed both in disease-related as well as in functional amyloids.

RESULTS Exploration of the sequence space for amyloid propensity Most of the experimentally characterized amyloid sequences ­available to this date are hexapeptides. Community-­generated, experimentally verified amyloidogenic hexapeptides are ­available in the AmylHex database25 consisting of 67 ‘positive’ and 91 ‘﻿­negative’ examples that have been used to benchmark new methods. Although there is no doubt that amyloid nucleating sequences in full-length proteins are often longer than six residues29 and that the full-length protein context can considerably modulate amyloid propensity30, this length of six residues has been found to represent a minimalistic amyloid nucleating core, which as an insertion is sufficient to induce amyloid conversion of an entire protein domain2. The use of short peptides therefore minimizes the risk of alignment errors, whereas for longer amyloid sequences it is often not clear whether all residues participate in the β-sheet or are just tolerated dangling ends.
The AmylHex database, however, has a high sequence redundancy, as it has a strong overrepresentation (51%) of point mutations of the amyloidogenic hexapeptide STVIIE15. To unbias this dataset to more generally reflect amyloido­genic properties in ­naturally occurring peptides, we used the AmylHex set as a starting point to construct a first position scoring matrix, which we used to select increasingly divergent hexapeptides (Online Methods). In this manner, we identified and experimentally ­validated 49 new amyloid hexapeptide sequences as well as 71 negative (non-amyloid-forming) hexapeptide sequences (Supplementary Table 1). To unequivocally distinguish amyloid fibrils from nonfibrillar β-aggregates, we relied on a combination of electron microscopy (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1), circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectro­ scopy. For selected cases, we also collected X-ray diffraction data (Fig. 1a), which revealed oriented diffraction patterns, all showing the characteristic diffraction signals for cross–β-amyloid fibrils16. We collected circular dichroism spectra of an aging hexapeptide solution (Fig. 1b), which showed β-sheet–enriched spectrum, and FTIR spectra (Fig. 1c), which displayed the typical peaks for β-sheet–enriched structure around 1,630 and 1,680 cm−1.
When we added the 49 new sequences we identified to the existing 67 AmylHex peptides, our training set of amyloid ­ forming

hexapeptides was comprised of 116 positive and 103 negative sequence examples (the full training set is available at http://waltz. switchlab.org/). This increases the amount of learning ­examples compared to the AmylHex database by 70%. More importantly, we increased the number of nonredundant positive sequences by 370%, allowing for a better mapping of the position-specific sequence propensities of amyloidogenic hexapeptides.
Position-specific properties of amyloidogenic hexapeptides We aligned our learning hexapeptide set and used it to ­generate a position-specific scoring matrix for amyloid propensity (Online Methods and Fig. 2). Almost all amino-acids had highly ­position-dependent propensities ranging from unfavorable to highly ­favorable for amyloid formation. Notably, residues with relatively low hydrophobicity such as glutamine and asparagine showed the greatest position dependency. This helps explain why prediction methods relying on average physical properties and

Benchmarking on independent data We next addressed whether Waltz covers sufficient sequence space to allow recognition of amyloidogenic sequences that are sufficiently different from the original AmylHex set by comparing Waltz’s performance to five existing algorithms that use very ­ different prediction strategies. These algorithms can be accessed on the recently developed AmylPred webserver26. These include: (i) the average packing density algorithm23, (ii) the dual sheet/helix propensity method26, (iii) the hexapeptide sequence pattern15, allowing us to directly benchmark the sequence enrichment of our learning set, (iv) Tango19, which exploits average physical properties such as hydrophobicity, secondary structure and charge to predict β-aggregation, and (v) the template modeling method40, which uses a scoring function directly derived from structural modeling on microcrystal structures.
We compared the ability of Waltz and these five other algorithms to predict the amyloid-forming propensity of the yeast prion sup35, which is strongly enriched in the polar amino acids glutamine, asparagine and tyrosine. Out of the 73 peptides covering the sup35 N-terminal domain that we experimentally tested, 12 peptides were capable of forming amyloid at pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl. Waltz predicted seven of these correctly, yielding a sensitivity of 58%. This is a considerable improvement in comparison with the earlier hexapeptide-based method15, which predicted only 3 out of 12 peptides (25% sensitivity). The other methods achieved between 0 and 8% sensitivity (Table 1) for the sup35 dataset.
Whereas benchmarking by cross-validation (84% ­ sensitivity and 92% specificity; Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Notes 3 and 4) likely represents the higher-limit performance expectation of Waltz, the very restrictive benchmarking performed on sup35 (58% sensitivity, 90% specificity) probably represents a realistic lower limit performance expectation for Waltz, because

we performed the evaluation on independent sequences that have a very different composition from the original AmylHex set. Nevertheless, Waltz outperformed earlier methods in its ability to predict amyloid morphology. Although the sensitivity could still be improved by extension of the training set with ever more divergent sequences, our results showed that Waltz extends amyloid prediction to parts of sequence space that were previously unmapped.
Prediction of functional amyloids Amyloids are not only associated with disease-related proteins. Nature also exploits the structural and mechanical properties of amyloids to regulate biological functions13. For example, in bacteria amyloids such as curli promote biofilm formation and host invasion, and chaplins in bacteria and hydrophobins in yeast act as regulators of surface tension of water. Insects and fish use chorion amyloid as a component of eggshell, and spiders use spidroins in spider silk. Humans possess at least one functional amyloid protein: Pmel17 is used as a structural scaffold in melanin synthesis. The strength and flexibility of amyloids have attracted attention for their use as biomaterials. However, it remains to be understood how functional amyloids avoid the cytotoxic effects observed in disease amyloids. In part, functional amyloids are regulated by chaperones and proteases. But it is also becoming evident that sequence composition modulates ­critical biophysical parameters determining kinetics of assembly or mechanical strength.
We used Waltz to identify amyloid-forming amino-acid sequences in 22 functional amyloids6,13. To maximize our chances of identifying amyloid sequences in these proteins, we used a cutoff ensuring high sensitivity but at the cost of a somewhat lower specificity. In cases in which overlapping hexapeptides were found, we selected a peptide that contained the entire region

­encompassed by the peptides, resulting in peptides ranging from six to nine amino acids in length and experimentally tested the amyloid-­forming propensity of these peptides. As expected from the highly sensitive threshold used, we found that about 50% of the predicted sequences yielded clear amyloid fibrils under the conditions assayed, resulting in the identification of 22 ­ amyloid-forming regions in 17 out of the 22 functional amyloids tested (Table 2).

DISCUSSION Amyloid is a very specific structure in terms of order and orientation. X-ray fiber diffraction from amyloid fibrils reveal a characteristic cross-β-sheet diffraction pattern displaying a sharp 4.7 Å reflection along the fiber axis and a more diffuse reflection at 10–12 Å perpendicular to the fiber axis (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 1). X-ray crystallography of microcrystals from amyloid forming peptides have also allowed investigation of side-chain packing in cross-β amyloid structures17,28. As expected, we observed extensive side chain–side chain contacts both along and perpendicular to the fiber axis. Viewed along the fiber axis, side-chain interactions were dominated by in-register interactions of identical residues stacked with a periodicity of 4.7 Å, which is the distance between two adjacent H-bonded β-strands. Sidechain interactions perpendicular to the fiber axis are constituted of interdigitating side chains protruding from backbones that face each other with a distance of 10–12 Å, thereby forming a tightly packed steric zipper28 that constitutes the core of protofilaments (Fig. 4b,c).
Amorphous β-sheet aggregation, however, is less position­dependent and can, in principle, be achieved by any sequence that can adopt an extended conformation, is sufficiently hydrophobic and has no unsatisfied hydrogens or electostatic groups18,19. Thus β-sheet aggregation can be relatively easily predicted by methods that evaluate aggregation by evaluating biophysical parameters over a sequence segment, without the need for considering ­position-dependent values of these parameters19–21. In contrast, side-chain ­ interactions perpendicular to the fiber axis show that the quaternary packing of two amyloid β-sheets imposes more extensive and complementary steric constraints28. β-sheet aggregating sequences that are compatible with the formation of a steric zipper can ­therefore be stabilized in the amyloid structure by the formation of a ­protofilament, but sterically incompatible sequences will remain in a ‘molten’ and thus amorphous β-sheet structure. Thus, ­predicting amyloid morphology requires know­ ledge of these position-­specific sequence requirements15. Given the low abundance and diversity of experimentally validated amyloid-forming sequence sets, we did not have sufficient information to develop a reliable method to differentiate the specific amyloid morphology from amorphous β-sheet aggregates.
To address this issue, we expanded the existing AmylHex hexapeptide set to include increasingly diverging amyloid sequences, increasing the sequence diversity of the existing dataset by almost 400%. Waltz is unique in that it is, to our knowledge, the first position-specific amyloid sequence prediction tool that can be used to distinguish between amyloid and amorphous aggregate sequences. We extensively validated the performance of Waltz by experimentally characterizing additional amyloidforming ­peptides both in functional amyloid proteins as well as in ­proteins hitherto not shown to possess amyloid potential.

(b,c) A molecular model showing the β-strands running perpendicular to the fiber axis (b) and the fibril cross-section, highlighting the interdigitation of the side chains (c).
In total, the training and validation of Waltz resulted in the identification of 111 new amyloid-forming hexapeptides.
Waltz also has a better ability to detect amyloid-forming potential involving polar amino acids such as found in prions and functional amyloids. Given the diversity of the current sequence dataset, a realistic performance estimate is in the 60–80% range for both sensitivity and specificity. Although additional sequence information might still improve the accuracy of pssm-based amyloid prediction, the simplicity of the assumptions (hexapeptide model, no differentiation between parallel and antiparallel orientation) will also have to be revisited and refined as more sequence and structural information becomes available.

ONLINE METHODS Generation of the hexapeptide learning set. In a first step, the sequence information of the original AmylHex set was used to generate a Prosite31-style sequence mask. This was then used to screen and experimentally validate candidate regions in fulllength amyloidogenic proteins for which the precise amyloid­o­ genic regions were still unidentified. In parallel, double and triple mutations within the hydrophobic core of the STVIIE sequence have been investigated experimentally for amyloid fibril formation to better map interpositional dependencies. This exercise generated 30 new amyloid hexapeptides which we added to the AmylHex set (Table 1). In a second step, an initial crude log-odd based sequence profile has been generated from this extended AmylHex set and used to scan a general set of human proteins previously not related to amyloidosis. The resulting hexapeptide hits were then ranked by their dissimilarity to already experimentally tested ones (as judged with a Hamming distance of BLOSUM62 scores) and the top 30 that shared the least sequence similarity to known amyloidogenic examples were tested experimentally, to enrich the sequence diversity in the learning set. This exercise generated another 19 new amyloid hexapeptides (Table 1).
Amyloid peptide analysis. All peptides were obtained from JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH. Peptide stock solutions were prepared by dissolving a weighed amount of peptide (1 mg ml−1) into the buffer indicated in the text. Samples were immediately sonicated using a Branson sonifier for 10 min to dissemble preformed nuclei and centrifuged (5 min at 16,100g) to deposit insoluble material. The concentration of the stock solutions was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 or 220 nm for ­peptides without aromatic residues. Peptide solutions were incubated at room temperature (25 °C) and checked by circular dichroism or FTIR and electron microscopy at different incubation times (t = 0 and 1 month). In case a peptide sequence did not reveal fibrils by electron microscopy after 3 months, the incubation was repeated with a three times higher concentration.
Electron microscopy. Aliquots (5 µl) of a peptide preparation were adsorbed to carbon-coated FormVar film on 400-mesh copper grids (Plano GmbH) for 1 min. The grids were blotted, washed twice in 50 µl droplets of Milli-Q water and stained with 1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate. Samples were studied with a FEI Morgagni 268(D) microscope at 120 kV and a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope at 200 kV.
X-ray fiber diffraction analysis. Peptides were dissolved in milliQ 0.2 µm filtered water at a concentration of 10mg ml−1 and incubated for a week at room temperature. We suspended 10–20 µl of peptide solution between two wax filled capill­aries32 and allowed them to dry at room temperature to form partially aligned fiber samples. X-ray diffraction data were collected using a RAxis IV++ detector with rotating anode CuKalpha X-ray source with exposure times of 10–20 min and data were examined using Clearer33.
Spectroscopy. Circular dichroism measurements were recorded on a Jasco Spectropolarimeter J715 using quartz cuvettes (Hellma) with path lengths of 0.2–0.5 mm. A scan rate of 1 nm s−1 was used, and 15 spectra were averaged for each measurement. Samples

were equilibrated at 25 °C using a water bath. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker Tensor 37 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an AquaSpec flowcell or a bioATR sample cell. The sample compartment wa s equilibrated to 25 °C; 100 spectra were averaged for a good signal-to-noise ratio.
Alignment of learning set sequences. Besides being reliably verified, the number and variety of bona fide examples is critical for sequence profiles to approximate a general model and sample the sequence space sufficiently. Finally, our strongly increased non­ redundant learning set strengthens feasibility of a sequence-based prediction attempt. For a position-specific sequence profile an alignment of the learning set sequences is required that follows the β-sheet arrangement and, therefore, needs to be gapless. Ideally, independent sequence profiles should be derived for parallel and antiparallel β-sheet–forming sequences assuming different interaction types. However, the vast majority of experimental data do not include information on the preferred relative orientation of the β-strands and it is, hence, not possible to separate the data supported by experimental evidence.
One would expect that a cluster analysis of known hexa­peptide examples could separate the data into two groups reflecting parallel and antiparallel sheets. Therefore, we modeled a set of hexapeptides from amyloid-related disease proteins into available parallel and antiparallel fibril structures and evaluated their energy using FoldX34. Notably, the energy distribution of the tested peptides for both orientations was hardly ­distinguishable for most cases. Only the classical example for a peptide with opposite charges on each end had a sharp stability increase in the antiparallel sheet, which can clearly be explained by electro­ static effects. Apparently, a certain similarity of residues at ­corresponding opposite ends can result in sequences that are similarly compatible with both orientations.
Indeed, when comparing the amino acid frequency distributions at the different positions of a nonredundant set of known fibril-forming hexapeptides, we found strong correlations (up to R > 0.7) among reciprocal positions both in the center but especially at the ends of the hexapeptide (for example, R = 0.72 for positions 1 and 6). Consequently, a sequence profile based on the currently known hexapeptide examples would not suffer from merging a presumed mixture of parallel and antiparallel examples into one learning set owing to the observed symmetry of motif positions flanking the core residues. Eventually, when sufficient reliable experimental data are available to separate parallel and antiparallel fibrils, this issue should be revisited.
Another possible variation in the alignment of β-strands are register shifts (for example, aligning position 1 in one strand with position 2 of the other). However, such shifts are assumed to be of minor importance in the case of isolated hexapeptides because any parallel translation of the strands relative to each other results in increasing solvent exposure of the respective ends which, clearly, is associated with a high energetic cost.
Selection of optimal subset of learning set sequences. Assuming a heterogeneous mixture of interaction types in our learning set consisting of a majority with similar properties and only a few outliers, we opted to test this rationally derived hypothesis by a data-driven approach. Therefore, we progressively knocked out groups of similar sequences (with high identity) from the learning

set and tested how well the resulting subset predicts the currently available full dataset. This procedure aims to find the most general sequence profile and unselects peptides that are less compatible with the dominant interaction model. For example, in our case, such an outlier-stripped subset profile selected for high specificity can result in a sensitivity increase of up to 40% compared to a profile blindly using the full learning set. Our final learning subset for generating the sequence profile consists of 91 of the 125 positive and 122 of the 138 negative examples contained in the total learning set.
There is the danger that removal of sequences from the profile can create new pseudocounts and give unwanted strength to the implemented pseudocount scheme. This is, however, not the case here, as the amino acids at affected positions are well-sampled by the remaining peptides, and the pseudocount penalty was furthermore chosen to have only little influence on the total score of a peptide.
The majority of unselected positive examples are STVIIEderived single mutations, including STVIIE itself (accounting for 29 of 34 removed sequences). These peptides featured mutations only at the first and last positions, indicating that their measured effect on fibril formation is strongly dependent on the sequence of the peptide core (TVII), rather than being a general model. Similarly, the unselected negative examples are mainly from the STVIIE-like set. Among them was a group of sequences with opposite charges at the peptide termini that are listed as nonfibril formers in the AmylHex database. However, these were in fact found to form fibrils under special conditions (neutralization of the charged N and C termini but not the side-chain charges, by acetylation and amidation, respectively) and were therefore rightfully unselected from the negative set. Notably, two known fibril-forming peptides from the yeast prion sup35 were also unselected as outliers. They were indeed different from the majority of the learning set through their high glutamine and asparagine content. Nevertheless, the profile of the remaining sequence subset still recognized them as good fibril-formers with high prediction scores, distracting our concerns that the glutamine- and asparagine-rich peptides could have strongly differing interaction modes.
Sequence profile. The sequence profile was calculated as ­standard log-odd score in a position-specific matrix (the value for each amino acid at each position is the logarithm of the ratio of its frequency in the learning set and the background database). As we have a positive and a negative set that both sample well the amino acid space over the motif positions, we created one profile for each set and subtract the score against the negative profile (compliance with the negative set) from the score against the positive profile. We tested various pseudocount schemes (to avoid un­defined logarithm calculation caused by zero frequencies) ­ ranging from a simple constant pseudofrequency, over a background database dependent frequency, to a complex expected frequency derived from BLOSUM substitution probabilities considering all observed amino acid frequencies. Finally, when keeping the influence of the pseudocount model low regarding the contribution to the total score, all tested schemes resulted in a similar prediction performance and, hence, we chose the simple model of a constant pseudofrequency of 0.1% for nonobserved amino acids.
The amino acid variability is not equally distributed among the motif positions and the core positions seem to have higher

importance for the amyloidogenic property of a peptide. We accounted for this by adding weights to the individual positions in the sequence profile indirectly proportional to their observed amino acid variability35. Again, we tested several different models to estimate this variability and found the Shannon entropy of amino acid group conservation a suitable measure. Thereby, the weight becomes the bit score derived from conservation of amino acids belonging to 6 groups of similar physicochemical properties, as defined previously36.
Physical property descriptor selection. Besides the sequence profile, we also refined the motif characteristics in terms of physical property descriptors that will be added to the prediction scoring function. From a database of roughly 700 normalized parameter sets of physical properties for each of the 20 natural amino acids37,38, we selected a subset of candidate properties for individual, pairs and regions of motif positions using various statistical methods, as established previously39 but following a semiautomated procedure. First, we identify physical property scales that strongly correlated with the amino-acid frequencies of a nonredundant subset of our learning set, separately for the positive and negative examples.
Second, we selected the physical properties with the strongest deviation in positional and regional averages between our positive learning set and UniRef50 representing the expected random property value in large database searches. Third, we identified the strongest normalized property deviations between the positive and negative nonredundant learning sets. For the average deviation analyses, the balance between single positions and regions was reached by dividing the property deviation by the square root of the number of considered positions. We only considered deviations larger than 0.5 of the s.d. of the property in the positive set to reduce the number of candidates based on the significance of the deviation.
Fourth, we considered interpositional dependencies estimated by the Fisher ratio of variances, separately for the positive and negative nonredundant learning sets. The task of identifying interpositional correlations from a multiple alignment of sequences was not straightforward, and we introduced an additional internal cross-validation step. Apart from having a significant Fisher ratio with P > 0.99, we required that removing any of the learning set sequences does not alter the average of the property calculated over the correlated positions to fall out of the range determined by the s.d. of the full set. Thereby, we aimed to identify inter­ positional dependencies that were highly robust and general in regard to the learning set.
The following pruning rules apply to all candidate sets derived from the different analyses described above. Properties that correlate with R > 0.9 with an average database composition property are excluded to eliminate unspecific descriptors. To avoid redundant properties for the same positions or regions, only the best properties were selected among those that correlate with each other with R > 0.4. To avoid redundancy among positions and regions, we only kept the best position or region for each property.
Altogether, our semiautomated procedure selected 94 ­propertyposition or region mappings, which we continue to refer to as physical property regions (PPRs). From this pool of candidate PPRs, we derived an effective subset using a heuristic genetic

programming-inspired procedure. Therefore, a formula was ­iteratively ‘evolved’ by linear combination of PPRs. The ­‘fitness’ of the formula was determined by the Matthew correlation co­efficient (MCC) of a receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis over the nonredundant positive and negative learning sets, where a set of random peptides from UniRef50 is added to the latter to allow testing for general database overprediction. Analogous to evolutionary selection, combinations were only accepted if the MCC was improved compared to the individual performances. As opposed to stochastic genetic algorithms, all possible combinations of PPRs were tested exhaustively, but we therefore limited the number of generations or iterations. Another difference to classic genetic algorithms is that we did not automatically unselect a fraction of worst performing formulas. Instead, after each iteration, a pruning step removed formulas whose performance was matched by another formula consisting of less individual PPRs, thereby favoring compact formulas. All accepted PPR combinations, as well as all initial single PPRs, were allowed to recombine in the next iteration. However, we only kept the best 7 formulas for each individual starting PPR, to avoid dragging along endless variations of formulas dominated by a single PPR with strong predictive power. After 10 iterations, the above-described procedure presents a formula with only 19 of the 94 PPRs remaining. As we allowed individual PPRs to enter the formula multiple times, a relative weighting of the PPRs among each other is obtained by their relative occurrences. The selected PPRs, listed in Supplementary Table 3, were assumed to be charac­ teristic descriptors of the investigated motif as it is presented in the learning sets. More importantly, these semiautomatically selected physical property descriptors matched previous findings and expectations.
Structural modeling. The fibril crystal structure of the GNNQQNY peptide from Sup35 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 1YJP) was first reduced to polyalanine. Then, all possible pair combinations of all 20 natural amino acids at all positions were generated and energy-optimized using FoldX. Energy estimates were calculated with FoldX as the ∆G difference (∆∆G) to the reference polyalanine. To retrieve a position-specific pseudoenergy matrix for the prediction scoring function, we then averaged for each amino acid the energies for all its occurrences at a certain position in combination with all amino acids at other positions.
Composite scoring function. Building up on earlier work39, Waltz combines sequence, physicochemical as we all as structural information into a composite scoring function (equation 2). A sequence score Sprofile was calculated from the log-odd based sequence PSSM derived as described in the preceding sequence profile subsection. The 19 selected physical properties enter the scoring function as a physical property term Sphysprop consisting

of the sum of the products of the amino acid frequency with the normalized property value of the respective amino acid for each position. The final component of the scoring function is the position-specific pseudoenergy matrix from the structural ­modeling (Sstruct). Relative weightings of the individual terms had to be introduced for a balanced scoring function:

Stotal = Sprofile + Sphysprop − 0.2 × Sstruct

(2)

Additionally, most methods take advantage of selected physical property scales for their predictions. Typically these properties are characteristic for the sets of known examples they are derived from and, hence, could be a source of overfitting. In our case, the benchmark was executed over the AmylHex dataset, which only had an approximate overlap of 50% with the nonredundant subset of the extended learning set that was used to select physical properties for Waltz. This difference between learning and benchmark set represented a strong cross-validation by itself. In contrast, the structure-derived contributions were independent of the learning set and did not need to be cross-validated.
Indeed, when omitting the physical property and structural descriptors in the prediction function, the sequence profile alone already showed a strong performance increase compared to the competing algorithms, albeit less than with the complete composite scoring function (data not shown). Hence, the sequence component of our scoring function yielded most of the predictive power, and we are confident that we addressed the problem of overfitting appropriately with the rigorous cross-validation.

True positives (%)

After the publication of our paper, we identified a mistake in Table 1 regarding the comparison of our program, Waltz, to the program 3D profile1 (ref. 25 in our paper); we cited the wrong name and reference of the algorithm in the right column. This error has been corrected after print to refer to the algorithm we actually used, the method described in reference 2 (ref. 40 in the corrected paper). However, as the 3D profile1 method developed in the Eisenberg laboratory has a long-standing good reputation as an amyloid prediction tool, here we compare it to Waltz. An improved version of 3D profile3 was published about a week and a half before our paper, so for complete transparency we also compare Waltz to the improved 3D profile algorithm.
In Table 1 we list all predicted peptides and scores or energies, respectively, comparing Waltz (threshold 77, running on our webserver at http://waltz.switchlab.org/) with the 3D profile1 scores at the ZipperDB website (http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/zipperdb; energy threshold was –23; additional shape complementarity > 0.7 for the 3D profile 2010 version3). The sensitivity of 3D profile on our sup35 positive set was 67% (75% if one includes prediction of a hexapeptide that is almost but not fully included in the tested decapeptide).
However, the higher sensitivity of 3D profile comes at a cost of lower specificity (more false positives). To estimate the rate of false positives, we derived a reliable negative set from our experimental data for sup35, which included all decapeptides that did not form fibers under the unified experimental conditions and did not overlap with any positively tested one (31 in total). However, we cannot draw hard conclusions as the availability of bona fide experimental data is typically limiting and these numbers are too low for a good general comparison. An additional complication is that 3D profile is designed to predict hexapeptides; as next best approximation we defined the best score or energy of a fully included hexapeptide as prediction for the respective peptides. Owing to this limitation and the fact that well-predicted hexapeptides may actually form amyloid fibers and the longer decapeptide does not, it may be wiser to exclude such peptides in an alternative comparison with only 26 ‘negative’ peptides, the reduced benchmark set (‘–5’) (Table 1).
Sensitivities of predictors should either be compared at similar levels of specificity (as should be done in consensus methods, such as AmylPred4), or one needs to consider both sensitivity and specificity together. Established measures for this are the Matthew correlation coefficient and the probability excess5. Probability excess has the additional advantage that it is also independent of set size inequalities6, which are not considered in other measures such as accuracy and precision.

The resulting performance statistics are reported in Table 2. Although 3D profile 2006 version1 predicted several additional
false positives compared to Waltz, the improved 3D profile 2010 version3 filtered out several of these. Considering the possibility
that high-scoring hexapeptides may indeed form fibers outside of
the experimentally tested decapeptide context, the performances of Waltz and 3D profile (2010 version)3 become comparable over
the reduced benchmark set (‘–5’). In fact, the observed differ-
ences may well be within the error of performance estimation
given the small benchmark set.
We also performed a receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
curve analysis to benchmark the performance of Waltz, 3D profile 2006 version1, Tango7, Packing8 and Aggrescan9 on the AmylHex dataset1 (Fig. 1). The AmylHex dataset is an experimentally vali-
dated set of hexapeptides containing 67 positive (amyloid form-
ing) and 91 negative (non–fiber forming) examples. Although 3D
profile and the other methods in this benchmark were not sub-
jected to cross-validation, we additionally scrutinized Waltz using
rigorous cross-validation criteria as outlined in Supplementary
Notes 3 and 4 of our original paper. We emphasize that the 3D profile method1 in this ROC curve was the version from 2006; we did not test the performance of the improved 3D profile3
method.
Our and others’ recent work has additionally contributed sev-
eral new experimentally verified examples, which should form
the basis of an enlarged benchmark set to allow standardized
ROC comparison of amyloid predictors by all interested groups
in the future.
