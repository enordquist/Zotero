ABSTRACT: Molecular dynamics simulations using physicsbased atomistic force ﬁelds have been increasingly used to
characterize the heterogeneous structural ensembles of intrinsi-
cally disordered proteins (IDPs). To evaluate the accuracy of the latest atomistic explicit-solvent force ﬁelds in modeling
larger IDPs with nontrivial structural features, we focus on the
61-residue N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of tumor
suppressor p53, an important protein in cancer biology that has
been extensively studied, and abundant experimental data is
available for evaluation of simulated ensembles. We performed extensive replica exchange with solute tempering simulations, in excess of 1.0 μs/replica, to generate disordered structural ensembles of p53-TAD using six latest explicit solvent protein force ﬁelds. Multiple local and long-range structural properties,
including chain dimension, residual secondary structures, and transient long-range contacts, were analyzed and compared
against available experimental data. The results show that IDPs such as p53-TAD remain highly challenging for atomistic simulations due to conformational complexity and diﬃculty in achieving adequate convergence. Structural ensembles of p53TAD generated using various force ﬁelds diﬀer signiﬁcantly from each other. The a99SB-disp force ﬁeld demonstrates the best
agreement with experimental data at all levels and proves to be suitable for simulating unbound p53-TAD and how its
conformational properties may be modulated by phosphorylation and other cellular signals or cancer-associated mutations. Feasibility of such detailed structural characterization is a key step toward establishing the sequence-disordered ensemble− function−disease relationship of p53 and other biologically important IDPs.

■ INTRODUCTION
Lacking well-deﬁned three-dimensional structures under physiological conditions, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are functional proteins that deviate from the traditional protein structure−function paradigm.1−10 Sequence analyses have shown that nearly one-half of eukaryotic proteins contain disordered regions whose lengths are at least 30 amino acids,11 which implies that many proteins may rely on intrinsic disorder to perform biological functions. Indeed, IDPs could speciﬁcally interact with many cellular targets under diﬀerent conditions, thus playing critical roles in cellular signaling and regulation.5,7,8,11−13 Missense mutation of IDPs, changes in IDP concentration, or aggregation of IDPs are frequently associated with human diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.11,13−16 Thus, there is a great need to characterize the detailed structural and dynamic properties of IDPs in order to better understand the functional mechanisms of IDPs in many biological processes.
The highly dynamic and heterogeneous conformations of IDPs pose great challenges in their experimental characterization. They must be described using ensembles of diverse structures that do not lend themselves to description using

traditional methods that are geared toward describing a coherent set of similar structures. For a disordered protein state, only ensemble-averaged properties can be measured in most cases,17−21 which alone are insuﬃcient to uniquely deﬁne the heterogeneous ensemble.17,22,23 In contrast, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using physics-based atomistic force ﬁelds could provide high temporal and spatial resolution information for the system of interest, thus oﬀering a powerful tool in characterizing the detailed structures of IDPs. Properly validated using experimental data, the simulated ensemble could provide the much needed basis for establishing how intrinsic conformational disorder mediates protein function and how such functional mechanism may be altered in diseases.
Nevertheless, challenges still exist in atomistic simulations of IDPs. First, IDPs usually are more expanded than folded proteins with the same number of residues, requiring larger explicit solvent simulation boxes and signiﬁcantly increasing the computational cost. Eﬃcient enhanced sampling techniques24−27 and/or implicit treatment of solvent28−31 are often

needed to reduce the computational cost of adequate sampling
of the large conformational space of IDPs. However, a more
fundamental challenge lies in the accuracy of current protein force ﬁelds, since the quality of force ﬁeld ultimately
determines the reliability of simulated ensembles. The free
energy landscape of an IDP often displays a multitude of comparably shallow minima,32,33 and accurate description of
relative prevalence of these important substates has pushed the limit of protein force ﬁelds. In fact, the need for accurate simulation of IDPs has prompted intensive eﬀorts toward developing improved atomistic force ﬁelds.28,34−42
It has been shown that many modern atomistic force ﬁelds
could describe folded proteins and some small IDPs quite well.
For example, 12 structurally distinct proteins have been shown43 to reversibly fold into their native states using the CHARMM22* force ﬁeld.39 By systematic comparison against 524 NMR measurements on very short peptides (≤4 residues) and a folded protein, ubiquitin,44 ﬀ99sb-ildn-phi45 or ﬀ99sbildn-NMR46 force ﬁelds were found to yield errors that are
comparable to the experimental uncertainty. In another benchmark study,47 both ﬀ99SB*-ILDN42,48,49 and CHARMM22*39 were found to reproduce experimental data on folded proteins and small IDPs (10−15 residues) quite
well. As for slightly larger IDPs, for instance, the 24-residue arginine/serine (RS) peptide, CHARMM 22*,39 was observed to agree best with experimental measurement.50 However, it
has also been increasingly recognized that most explicit solvent atomistic force ﬁelds often generate overly compact con-
formations for the unfolded state of proteins and larger IDPs.37,38,51,52 Several strategies then have been proposed to alleviate this problem. For example, a new water force ﬁeld, TIP4P-D,37 has been developed, where water dispersion
interaction was increased by approximately 50% compared with the TIP3P water force ﬁeld.53 Another approach was to scale up the Lennard−Jones (LJ) interactions between protein and water, such as in the Amber ﬀ03ws force ﬁeld.38 More recently, the CHARMM36m35 and a99SB-disp34 force ﬁelds
were developed based on extensive simulations of tens of
folded and disordered proteins and peptides, demonstrating
impressive levels of accuracy in simulating both folded and intrinsically disordered proteins.
These exciting developments in protein force ﬁeld
optimization have now paved the way for broader application
of atomistic simulations to larger and more complex IDPs of
biological and biomedical interest. In this work, we focus on the N-terminal transactivation domain of tumor suppressor p53 (p53-TAD, residues 1−61), one of the most frequently mutated proteins in human cancers.54,55 The stability and
activity of p53 are tightly controlled by its interactions with key
regulators, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300.56 These interactions
are mediated through the intrinsically disordered TAD domain of p53, which can speciﬁcally recognize these targets and often
gain stable secondary and tertiary structures upon binding.
Under normal cellular conditions, p53-TAD binds more tightly to MDM2, leading to polyubiquitination and degradation of p53.57,58 Under prolonged genotoxic stress, p53-TAD
accumulates phosphorylation at multiple sites, which reduces binding aﬃnity to MDM2 and enhances binding to the CBP/ p300, resulting in stabilization and activation of p53.59−63 Thus
far, the molecular mechanisms of how phosphorylation modulates binding aﬃnity to MDM2 and CBP/p300 is not obvious. The eﬀects of phosphorylation on binding is typically

understood by examining how it may provide additional interaction sites or disrupt the existing binding interface in the complex state. However, available structures of p53-TAD complexes64−67 suggest that most phosphorylation sites are outside of the binding interface. Instead, the eﬀects of p53TAD phosphorylation are likely achieved through modulation of the unbound state, where the disordered ensemble is poised to respond sensitively to post-translational modiﬁcations and mutations. Altered level of partially formed secondary structures and/or tertiary contacts may lead to diﬀerent folding conformational entropy cost upon speciﬁc binding and modulate the binding aﬃnity.68,69 Therefore, the disordered ensemble of p53-TAD is likely a central conduit of p53 regulation, and its detailed characterization will be critical for establishing the sequence-disordered ensemble−function− disease relationship of p53.
As a key step toward detailed characterization of the structural ensembles of p53-TAD using MD simulations, one needs to carefully examine if the current protein force ﬁeld could accurately recapitulate key structural features revealed by available experimental measurements. Due to its biological and biomedical signiﬁcance, p53-TAD has been extensively characterized using several experimental techniques,70−75 including NMR, single-molecule FRET (smFRET), and time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET). These studies have revealed that p53-TAD contains nontrivial structural features, including multiple residual helical elements70,73,75 and transient longrange contact formation.74,76 The conformational complexity and availability of a large amount of experimental data also makes p53-TAD an ideal model system for evaluating the quality of current protein force ﬁelds for simulating increasingly complex IDPs of biological interest.
In the present work, we evaluate six of the latest protein force ﬁelds including CHARMM36m35 (herein termed c36m), CHARMM36m35 with an alternative water force ﬁeld35 (herein termed c36mw), CHARMM22*39,77,78 (herein termed c22*), ﬀ99SB-ILDN,48,49 ﬀ99SB-ILDN49 with TIP4P-D water force ﬁeld37 (herein termed ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D), and a99SB-disp.34 To obtain suﬃcient sampling of relevant conformational space for the 61-residue p53-TAD peptide, we deployed the replica exchange with solute tempering (REST2) enhanced sampling technique,27,79 which allows tempering on only the region of interest (e.g., protein) and dramatically reduces the computational cost of replica exchange types of simulations in explicit solvent.80−83 Two independent REST2 simulations were performed starting from distinct conformations for each force ﬁeld examined to allow rigorous evaluation of the convergence of simulated ensembles. The aggregated simulation time is over 192 μs. A wide range of local and long-range structural features of p53-TAD were carefully analyzed and compared directly against available experimental measurements.
■ METHODS Simulation Details. The p53-TAD domain (residues 1− 61: MEEPQ SDPSV EPPLS QETFS DLWKL LPENN VLSPL PSQAM DDLML SPDDI EQWFT EDPGP D) was studied in this work. The N- and C-termini were capped with an acetyl group and N-methyl amide, respectively. The six latest protein force ﬁelds were examined, including c36m,35 c36mw,35 c22*,39,77,78 ﬀ99SB-ILDN,48,49 ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D,37,49 and a99SB-disp.34 For each force ﬁeld two independent REST2 simulations were performed, one starting from a highly

helical state (i.e., control run) and the other one starting from Ewald (PME) method.88 Lengths of all bonds involving

an extended state (i.e., folding run). This allows rigorous evaluation of simulation convergence. The protein was simulated in a truncated octahedron box containing at least 23 500 water molecules. The shortest distance between two opposite hexagons was ∼9.8 nm, which proved suﬃciently large to prevent signiﬁcant contacts of the protein with its periodic images (see Figure S1).14 Na+ were added to neutralize the system.
All simulations were carried out using GROMACS 5.1.484,85 patched with PLUMED 2.3.0.82,86,87 The initial conformation was ﬁrst energy minimized using a steepest descent algorithm
for 6000 steps. NVT simulation at 298 K was then performed for 100 ps, followed by 1 ns of NPT simulation at 298 K and 1 atm, during which the position of protein heavy atoms was restrained using harmonic potentials with force constants of 1000 kJ/mol/nm2. The system was then equilibrated under the
same NPT condition for another 1 ns, removing all restraints on the protein. From this NPT simulation the mean volume of the simulation box was calculated, and one conformation was selected with its volume closest to the mean volume. This conformation was then used as the initial structure for the production NVT run at 298 K. Only the protein was subjected to tempering, which was achieved by scaling the solute−solute and solute−solvent interactions by λ and √λ, respectively. Sixteen replicas were used in all cases, with λ values set to 1.00, 0.97, 0.93, 0.90, 0.87, 0.84, 0.81, 0.79, 0.76, 0.73, 0.71, 0.68, 0.66, 0.64, 0.62, and 0.60. They correspond to 16 exponentially spaced eﬀective temperatures of the protein, ranging from 298 to 500 K. Replica exchange was attempted every 2 ps, and the averaged exchange acceptance ratio was ∼25%. Each simulation lasted for ∼1 μs/replica. In simulations using the c36m,35 c36mw,35 or c22*39,77,78 force ﬁeld, van der Waals interactions were truncated at 1.2 nm, with the force smoothly
switched to zero starting from 1.0 nm and the neighboring list updated every 10 steps. When ﬀ99SB-ILDN,49 ﬀ99SB-ILDNTIP4P-D, or a99SB-disp34 was used, the van der Waals interactions were cut oﬀ at 1.0 nm with the neighboring list updated every 5 steps. For all simulations, long-range
electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh

hydrogen atoms were constrained using the LINCS algorithm,89 which allows for an integration time step of 2 fs.
Analysis. By examining the evolution of secondary
structure and radius of gyration of p53-TAD, the ﬁrst 300 ns

trajectories of each REST2 simulation were excluded from all

analyses to remove the initial condition dependence. Simulated

structure ensembles were constructed by collecting conforma-
tions sampled in the replica of λ = 1.00. Unless otherwise
speciﬁed, all structural analyses were performed using the GROMACS toolset84,85 and in-house scripts. Chemical shifts of simulated structures were calculated using SHIFTX2,90 and

the ensemble-averaged values were compared with experimental data.91 For secondary chemical shift analysis, random coil values92,93 were subtracted from both calculated and experimental91 chemical shifts. For conformational clustering

analysis, trajectories from independent control and folding

simulations were combined. For such a large and highly

dynamic system, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) in

the Cartesian coordinate space is not an optimal distance metric. Therefore, featurization was ﬁrst performed using the

DRID algorithm, distribution of reciprocal of interatomic distances,94 implemented in MSMBuilder 3.6.1,95 with only
Cα atoms selected in this calculation. K-means clustering was
then performed in the DRID space. Diﬀerent numbers of total

clusters were tested, including 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, and

10 000. Final results were reported for 1000 total clusters,

because smaller values would result in large clustering error, while larger values do not signiﬁcantly decrease the clustering

error, i.e., sum of squared distances of samples to their closest

cluster center (see Figure S2). The paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) eﬀects of

four sites (D7, E28, A39, and D61) were calculated for

simulated ensembles and directly compared with previously published experimental results.72 The ratios of peak intensities

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Evaluation of Self-Consistency of Simulated Ensem-
bles. The p53-TAD peptide provides an exceptional model system to understand the sequence-disordered ensemble− function−disease relationship of IDPs. In order to reliably

simulate the disordered ensembles of p53-TAD using de novo simulations, the ﬁrst and probably one of the most important

steps is to generate well-converged simulations. Here, the

convergence of our REST2 simulations was mainly assessed by

comparing the structural ensembles generated from the

independent control and folding runs (see Methods). As

shown in Figure 1, the overall dimension of p53-TAD

(indicated by the radius of gyration, Rg) appears well converged in c22*, ﬀ99SB-ILDN, ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D,

and a99SB-disp simulations. Similar observations could be

made for the distributions of end-to-end distance (Figure S3).

Acceptable convergence at the level of secondary structure is

also found for the REST2 simulations using these four force ﬁelds (Figure 2). This was further supported by comparing the results calculated from diﬀerent segments of each trajectory,

demonstrating the self-consistency of each individual simu-

lation (Figures S4 and S5).

However, it seems challenging to obtain convergence for c36m and c36mw simulations, as reﬂected by the distributions

of Rg (Figure 1), end-to-end distance (Figure S3), and residue helicity proﬁles (Figure 2). For example, as shown in Figure 2, residues 10−25 barely unfolded in the control simulations

(where initial structures were highly helical), while it remained

fully disordered in the folding simulations (where initial

structures were highly extended). As a result, REST2 simulations as conﬁgured were not able to generate converged ensembles when these two force ﬁelds were used to study p53-

TAD. We note that both sets of simulations appeared to reach

steady states, where distributions for individual control or
folding REST2 runs stopped changing (Figures S4 and S5).
This again highlights the importance of using independent runs with drastically diﬀerent initial conformations to
rigorously evaluate convergence in IDP simulations. Two
factors may contribute to the slow convergence of c36m and
c36mw simulations. The free energy barrier separating helical and unfolded coil states may be higher in these two force ﬁelds such that longer helix−coil transition time scales may have signiﬁcantly slowed down the convergence of REST2 simulations. On the other hand, the apparent diﬃculty of
achieving convergence with REST2 simulations using c36m
and c36mw may also be due to imperfect compensation between the scaled solute−solute and solute−solvent interaction energies, which will hinder the sampling eﬃciency of REST type of simulations.79 To further understand this issue, we extracted the last conformations at the λ = 1.00 condition
from the four REST2 simulations to initiate four multimicroseconds MD simulations at 298 K. After about another 1 μs, the seemingly long-lived helical states for residues 10−25 from
control REST2 simulations became unfolded in both c36m
and c36mw force folds; yet partial helix refolding was not observed in any of these 7 μs simulations (see Figure S6). This
suggests that lack of convergence of REST2 simulations in c36m and c36mw is likely attributed to the force ﬁeld
characteristics instead of the REST2 protocol. Due to a lack of
convergence, the quality of c36m and c36mw will not be
reliably evaluated based on the current REST2 and constant
temperature simulations. Therefore, we will mainly focus on evaluating c22*, ﬀ99SB-ILDN, ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D, and
a99SB-disp in the remainder of this study, where well-
converged structural ensembles are available from REST2
simulations. Overall Dimension of p53-TAD Varies Signiﬁcantly
among Diﬀerent Force Fields. A previous NMR study has
shown that under normal cellular conditions p53-TAD could
interact simultaneously with HDM2 (the human homologue of MDM2) and CBP domains, thus forming ternary complexes.60
The fate of these ternary complexes can be regulated by many
cellular events, such as phosphorylation of p53-TAD, thus aﬀecting the stability and activity of p53. According to this
model the compactness of p53-TAD may have a consequence
in its availability to these regulatory proteins and in

coordinating various interactions, as proposed previously.76 Therefore, in order to study the “structure”−function relation-
ship of p53-TAD using de novo simulations it is very
important to model its overall dimension correctly. Here we examine if these six force ﬁelds could describe the level of
compaction of p53-TAD. The results show that chain
dimensions of simulated p53-TAD ensembles depend strongly on the force ﬁeld used. For instance, simulations using c22* and ﬀ99SB-ILDN yield signiﬁcantly more compact ensembles compared to those generated by ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D and
a99SB-disp simulations (Figure 1 and Figure S3). The
ensemble-averaged Rg values were 1.26, 1.33, 2.61, and 2.60 nm in c22*, ﬀ99SB-ILDN, ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D, and
a99SB-disp simulations, respectively. This is not surprising as both of the latter two force ﬁelds have been parametrized speciﬁcally to overcome the overcompaction bias of earlier force ﬁelds.34,37 Despite a lack of convergence, scaling up protein−water interactions in the c36mw force ﬁeld clearly
leads to more expanded structural ensembles, which appears more in-line with results from ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D and
a99SB-disp simulations (Figure 1 and Figure S3). The Stokes radius of a slightly longer p53-TAD peptide (residues 1−73)
was found to be 2.38 nm based on size exclusion chromatography.72 Although the Stokes radius depends on multiple factors including protein shape and protein−solvent interactions, the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between calculated Rg values and experimental measurements suggests that both c22*

and ﬀ99SB-ILDN, and likely c36m, overestimate the
compaction of p53-TAD. We further assess the ability of these force ﬁelds to correctly
describe the overall compactness of p53-TAD as well as
transient long-range ordering by comparing the back-calculated PRE eﬀects with experimental measurements. PRE measurement provides ensemble-averaged distance information between the paramagnetic spin label at a speciﬁc residue location and all protons throughout the rest of the protein; it provides unparallelly rich information to examine the presence
(and absence) of transient long-range ordering of the simulated ensembles. In Figure 3 we compare the backcalculated PRE eﬀects with experimental results on labeling at residues 7 and 61, where the terminal locations of the spin label provide particularly useful information on the peptide
chain dimension. Quantitative comparison of experimental and back-calculated PRE eﬀects is summarized in Table 1. These results clearly conﬁrm that the simulated ensemble generated using c22* and ﬀ99SB-ILDN is overly compact, leading to global overestimation of PRE eﬀects (Figure 3). As for c36m
and c36mw simulations, although not converged, better agreement with experimental PRE measurements appear to be achieved compared to the older c22* force ﬁeld (Figure S7 and Table 1), demonstrating their improvement in describing the overall dimension of IDPs. Moreover, ﬀ99SB-ILDNTIP4P-D and a99SB-disp simulations are able to reliably
capture the chain dimension and long-range ordering of p53-

Ensemble-averaged distances between several pairs of
residues of p53-TAD have also been determined previously using smFRET and TR-FRET measurement71 (see Figure 4
and Figure S8). For the distances between residues 1 and 17 (Figure 4, top row), results from c22* and Amber ﬀ99SB-
ILDN simulations agreed well with experimental values, while ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D and a99SB-disp appeared to slightly
overestimate this distance. For another residue pair, 14 and 30 (Figure 4, middle row), all four force ﬁelds showed reasonable
agreement with the experimental data. However, caution needs
to be taken to interpret the absolute distance estimation from smFRET and TR-FRET experiments, since ﬂuorescence
properties and energy transfer also depend on environment and orientation of the dye,98 and the average distance inferred
from FRET can vary according to the model chosen to describe the distance distribution.99−101 Therefore, the
distances between these two residue pairs calculated from all simulations did not seem too qualitatively diﬀerent from

experimental measurement. On the other hand, the distance

between residues 10 and 56 was signiﬁcantly underestimated in

c22* and ﬀ99SB-ILDN simulations, while better agreement

was observed for ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D and a99SB-disp force

ﬁelds (Figure 4, bottom row). We also directly computed the

Förster critical distance. For the pair of residues 10 and 56, the

computed mean FRET eﬃciency for ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D

and a99SB-disp simulations was highly consistent with

experimental results, while c22* and ﬀ99SB-ILDN force ﬁelds

underestimated the distance (Table 2). Since these two

residues are close to N- and C-termini, respectively, in the

primary sequence, it may be used to approximate the end-to-

end distance and thus overall dimension of the peptide. The

results again suggest that c22* and ﬀ99SB-ILDN-derived

structures are too collapsed and that ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D

and a99SB-disp can faithfully predict the chain dimension of

p53-TAD.

Dependence of p53-TAD Secondary Structure on
Force Field. The level of secondary structure of IDPs is often ﬁnely tuned by their sequences, which is critical for signaling ﬁdelity.8 Many disease mutations in IDPs have been predicted
to alter secondary structure with higher probabilities than functionally neutral mutations,15 which may perturb the
protein interaction network and lead to misregulation. Multiple partial helices have also been identiﬁed in p53-TAD70,75 and suggested to play roles in mediating p53’s interactions with key regulators including MDM2 and CBP/p300.56 Cancer-
associated p53-TAD mutant K24N has been shown to reduce the helicity of residues 18−27.75 Therefore, it is very important to evaluate how well current force ﬁelds can capture residual
secondary structures. Like chain dimension, the secondary
structure content of p53-TAD also depends strongly on the chosen force ﬁeld. The helical content in c22* simulations,
although not fully converged for certain residues, seemed to be the highest among these four force ﬁelds, where three

segments (residues 15−25, 35−45, and 45−55) constantly
showed helical propensity of at least 40% for both control and
folding simulations (Figure 2). In contrast, there was almost no
residual helical structure in both control and folding simulations using the ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D force ﬁeld
(Figure 2). The residual helicities for the other two force ﬁelds, ﬀ99SB-ILDN and a99SB-disp, were in between these
two extremes. Previous NMR studies have shown that residues 17−29 were ∼10% helical, and two turns were assigned to the regions of 40−44 and 48−52.70,75 Nonetheless, continual sequential dNN NOEs and negative secondary Hα chemical shifts were found in the latter two regions,70 implying that
partial helical elements may exist. Results from the a99SB-disp force ﬁeld appear the most consistent with these experimental
observations (see Figure 2). To better quantify the level of agreement of simulated
ensembles with NMR results we calculated the secondary chemical shifts of Cα and C′ atoms, which are sensitive to the

secondary structure. The proﬁles of secondary chemical shift
are shown in Figures 5 and 6, and quantitative comparison
between simulated and experimental results is summarized in
Table 3. These results demonstrate that secondary chemical shifts of Cα and C′ atoms from a99SB-disp simulations agreed
the best with experimental measurements, suggesting that this force ﬁeld could properly describe the secondary structure
propensity of p53-TAD. Note that SHIFTX2 could predict
chemical shifts for folded proteins with RMS errors of 0.4412 and 0.5330 ppm for Cα and C′ atoms, respectively.90 Therefore, according to Table 3, results from the ﬀ99SBILDN force ﬁeld also seem in reasonable agreement with
experimental values. In contrast, the content of helical structure is signiﬁcantly underestimated by ﬀ99SB-ILDNTIP4P-D and overestimated by c22* (Figures 5 and 6).
We note a curious observation regarding the propensity of forming 310 helices from multiple fore ﬁelds. As summarized in Figure S9, the 310 helical content in simulations using three CHARMM force ﬁelds was low and signiﬁcantly lower than the corresponding α-helical content (Figure 2). This can be
directly attributed to the CMAP term used in CHARMM force ﬁelds, which was designed to rebalance the propensities of forming α, 310, and π helices.77 In contrast, the Amber family of force ﬁelds appears to generate signiﬁcant 310 helices. The only exception was ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D, but this may be a
direct result of increased water dispersion in the TIP4P-D water force ﬁeld that destabilizes both α (e.g., Figure 2) and
310 helices. As shown in Figure S9, the 310 helical propensity is comparable to the α-helical content for residues 20−25 in both ﬀ99SB-ILDN and a99SB-disp simulations. Similar observations have also been reported previously for ﬀ99SB*-ILDN,42,48,49 a force ﬁeld modiﬁed from ﬀ99SB-ILDN by rebalancing the

backbone helix−coil propensity, where the probability of forming 310 helix is higher in ﬀ99SB*-ILDN simulations than in those using other force ﬁelds (see Figure 2 in ref 50). It is
known that 310-helix represents the third principal secondary structure in folded proteins, following the α-helix and βsheet,102 with a population of ∼3%.103 Nevertheless, the
population of 310-helix in IDPs remains unclear. To better assess if there is any systematic bias in simulating p53-TAD or other IDPs using these force ﬁelds, more experimental data are
needed, including three-bond coupling constants. Detection of Transient Long-Range Contact Forma-
tion Using Diﬀerent Force Fields. Transient long-range
interactions in IDPs are known to have important functional implications.104−106 For example, a previous NMR study has shown that loss of transient long-range interactions in αsynuclein, an IDP associated with Parkinson’s disease, could
lead to completely unfolded conformations that aggregate more rapidly.106 Such transient long-range interactions have also been found in p53-TAD,74,76 and they can be modulated
both locally and remotely by binding of regulatory proteins or post-translational modiﬁcation.74 Thus, in order to obtain
reliable simulated structural ensembles of p53-TAD, the force ﬁeld also needs to be able to capture such important structural features. Experimentally, PRE in combination with site-speciﬁc
spin labeling provides a powerful tool in detecting transient long-range contact formation for IDPs.76,107−109 The increase in relaxation rate of a proton is proportional to 1/r6, where r is
the distance between the proton and the unpaired electron in a spin label. Because of this 1/r6 dependence, the PRE eﬀect is
suitable for identifying transient long-range contacts and insensitive to conformations with large proton−electron
distance. Since PRE measurement could detect contact

Figure 8. Contact probability maps calculated from independent control (top left) and folding (bottom right) simulations using four force ﬁelds.
Contact is considered formed if the minimum distance between heavy atoms of two residues is less than or equal to 0.42 nm. Local and intermediate range contacts between residues separated by ≤4 residues were not shown for clarity.

formation between unpaired electron and all amide protons in
a protein, it provides valuable information for globally
validating our simulation ensembles. Experimental PRE measurement76 found that residue 28 could become close to
many residues ranging from 16 to 55 (see Figure 7, top row).
This feature could be captured by all simulations, although c22* and ﬀ99SB-ILDN simulations seemed to underestimate
the distances to both N- and C-termini, and a99SB-disp may
overestimate the distances between residue 28 and residues 45−55 (Figure 7, top row). Similar observations could also be
found for PRE induced by spin labeling at residue 39 (Figure 7, bottom row). Notably, a99SB-disp and ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D force ﬁelds could even recapitulate some ﬁne features in the experimental PRE proﬁles (Figures 3 and 7). Taken together,

transient long-range interactions from ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D and a99SB-disp simulations agreed the best with experimental PRE (Table 1).
The presence of long-range contacts can be more directly and systematically examined using the contact probability map. As shown in Figure 8, c22* and ﬀ99SB-ILDN force ﬁelds generate signiﬁcantly more transient interactions than ﬀ99SBILDN-TIP4P-D and a99SB-disp force ﬁelds, consistent with the above observation that they may overestimate the compactness of p53-TAD (e.g., Figure 1). Nevertheless, many weakly populated tertiary contacts were also constantly observed in both ﬀ99SB-ILDN-TIP4P-D and a99SB-disp simulations (Figure 8), implying that the structural ensemble is highly heterogeneous. This can be illustrated by conforma-

tional clustering analysis shown in Figures 9 and S10−S12, where no major cluster with over 2% occupancy was identiﬁed (see Methods for details). Since many of these long-range contacts involve the regions important for binding to MDM2 or CBP domains (e.g., residues 16−26, 48−55, see Figure 8), in the future it would be interesting to study how these transient long-range contacts are modulated by mutation or post-translational modiﬁcation, thus shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of p53 regulation.
■ CONCLUSIONS
Accurate description of various local and long-range structural features of large, complex IDPs using empirical force ﬁelds is crucial for successful application of de novo simulations to characterize the disordered structure ensembles of IDPs and understand their sequence-disordered ensemble−function− disease relationships. We explored the 61-residue p53-TAD as an exceptional model system to assess the ability of the six latest protein force ﬁelds to describe nontrivial structural features within the disordered ensemble. Structural ensembles generated using microsecond-time scale REST2 enhanced sampling simulations were carefully analyzed and compared to a wide range of experimental measurements derived from NMR, smFRET, and TR-FRET experiments. The results show that complex IDPs like p53-TAD remain very challenging for atomistic explicit solvent simulations, not only in achieving an adequate level of convergence but also in proper description of local and long-range structural properties. Results from diﬀerent force ﬁelds can vary signiﬁcantly. Both c36m and c36mw fail to generate converged ensembles despite multiple microsecond simulation time scales. c22* generated overly compact structural ensembles, and residual helicity is also slightly overestimated. A similar problem of overcompactness was also observed in ﬀ99SB-ILDN simulations, but the helical propensity agreed well with NMR measurement. More expanded structures can be obtained by combining the ﬀ99SB-ILDN force ﬁeld with the TIP4P-D water force ﬁeld; this seems to be achieved at the expense of overdestabilizing protein−protein interactions, leading to signiﬁcant underestimation of residual secondary structures in p53-TAD. Encouragingly, the latest a99SB-disp force ﬁeld seems capable of faithfully recapitulating virtually all experimental measurements examined, including the overall chain dimension, residual secondary structures, and transient long-range ordering. As such, we anticipate that atomistic simulations using a99SB-disp will provide a viable approach for understanding how the disordered state of p53-TAD may be modulated by multisite phosphorylations and/or many cancer-associated mutations in biology and cancers. Such structural insights will pave the way for establishing the sequence-disordered ensemble−function−disease relationships of p53-TAD and other regulatory IDPs.
