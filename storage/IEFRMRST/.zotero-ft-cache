Abstract

Several prediction algorithms and tools have been developed in the last two decades to predict protein and peptide aggregation. These in silico tools aid to predict the aggregation propensity and amyloidogenicity as well as the identification of aggregation-prone regions. Despite the immense interest in the field, it is of prime importance to systematically compare these algorithms for their performance. In this review, we have provided a rigorous performance analysis of nine prediction tools using a variety of assessments. The assessments were carried out on several non-redundant datasets ranging from hexapeptides to protein sequences as well as amyloidogenic antibody light chains to soluble protein sequences. Our analysis reveals the robustness of the current prediction tools and the scope for improvement in their predictive performances. Insights gained from this work provide critical guidance to the scientific community on advantages and limitations of different aggregation prediction methods and make informed decisions about their research needs.

Introduction

Protein aggregation has been an active area research in recent years due to its association with human pathologies, a deteriorative role in the manufacturing, storage and shipping of protein therapeutics and enzymes for industrial applications;promise of viable mechanisms to build self-assembling nanostructures [ 1–6 ]. Amyloid fibrillization is associated with several human diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington and various amyloidosis [ 7 , 8 ]. Apart from the pathological importance, assessment of protein aggregation propensity is an essential part of the development of biotechnology products such as monoclonal antibodies, hormones, vaccines, enzymes and growth factors [ 9–12 ]. Higher aggregation propensity often correlates with low solubility and high viscosity, which affects product developability [ 13–15 ].

The growing interest and necessity to understand and control protein aggregation had triggered the development of several in silico tools during the last two decades [ 5 , 16–18 ]. These various prediction tools can be classified based on input features to the model: protein sequence or structure and outputs obtained from the model such as β-aggregation propensity or amyloidogenicity, aggregation-prone regions (APRs) or β-sheet arrangement. Further, sequence-based features themselves can vary widely, ranging from sequence patterns; amino acid properties such as hydrophobicity, charge or secondary strand propensity; position-specific residue preferences and residue-pair preferences [ 12 , 18–22 ].

However, the development and assessment of most of these prediction models are primarily based on a set of hexapeptide sequences [ 5 , 20 , 23–27 ] and extended datasets of experimentally identified APRs [ 28 , 29 ]. Most of these methods have been well reviewed in the literature [ 5 , 6 , 18 , 30 ]. In this work, we have performed a systematic comparative assessment of prediction performance using a series of diverse experimental datasets.
Methods and materials
Experimental datasets for performance comparison

Several diverse sequence datasets were collected from the literature to assess the prediction performance. These are described below and are available at https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/fileShare/AggReview2/datasets/ .

    (i) Hex1421 : Hex1421 consists of 512 amyloidogenic and 909 non-amyloidogenic hexapeptide sequences. These were collected from CPAD 2.0, WALTZ-DB and AmyLoad databases [ 26 , 27 , 31 , 32 ]. Several prediction algorithms have been trained and validated on these hexapeptide sequences. Clustering the hexapeptides based on number of identical residues lead to 491, 26 and 1 cluster(s) at sequence identity cut-off of 33.33% (2 residues), 50% (3 residues) and 60.67% (4 residues), respectively. Further, normalized entropy-based conservation score calculated at each position showed that the residues were not conserved (score: 0.88–0.92; 0: conserved; 1: variable) [ 33 , 34 ]. To avoid bias in performance comparison, sequences containing hexapeptides from Hex1421 were filtered out from other sequence datasets (listed below).

    (ii) Amyl37 : 37 amyloidogenic protein sequences with residue-level APR annotations were collected from AmyPro database [ 28 ] based on the following criteria: (a) sequence do not contain hexapeptides from Hex1421, (b) the protein contains less than 400 residues and (c) the APR fraction in the sequence is more than 5% and less than 100%. These restraints are added to filter out proteins with incomplete APR annotations.

    (iii) IAPP8 : Palato et al . [ 35 ] studied the amyloidogenicity of homologous sequences of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) protein from 12 different species. Among the 12 sequences, 4 sequences (from Human, Dog, Seal and Rat) containing hexapeptides from Hex1421 were removed.

    (iv) ALBase678 : 678 sequences of immunoglobulin light chain variable regions along with their association with amyloidosis were obtained from ALBase database ( http://albase.bumc.bu.edu/aldb ). The dataset contains 177 amyloidogenic and 501 non-amyloidogenic variable light chain sequences, respectively. The sequence identity among these sequences is less than 90%, and sequences do not contain hexapeptides from Hex1421.

    (v) Fold-Agg77 : A dataset of 46 proteins whose folding kinetics have been well studied experimentally and 31 aggregating protein sequences [ 36–38 ]. The sequences share less than 90% sequence identity and do not contain exact matches from Hex1421.

    (vi) Sol2151 : A dataset of 1077 soluble and 1074 insoluble E. coli protein sequences, respectively, which were experimentally studied in the in vitro system by Niwa et al . [ 39 ]. The sequences share less than 90% sequence identity.

Selection of prediction methods/algorithms

Among the various prediction algorithms and tools, we selected nine prediction tools based on the following criteria: (a) the method takes amino acid sequence as input for prediction, (b) the tools accessible as a webserver or stand-alone application and (c) can process large datasets of >100 sequences in a single submission. The list of various APR and aggregation propensity prediction tools compared in this study ( Table 1 ) is discussed below:

    (i) AGGRESCAN is based on aggregation-propensity scale for 20 natural amino acids [ 40 , 41 ] derived from in vivo mutagenesis experiments on Aβ fused to GFP. It predicts the intrinsic aggregation propensity of a given sequence and hotspots/APRs in protein sequences.

    (ii) AgMata utilizes energy potentials obtained from a dataset of globular protein structures [ 42 ] and a pair of logistic regression models for predicting parallel and antiparallel beta-aggregation propensity of protein sequences.

    (iii) AmyloGram employs n-gram analysis with reduction of amino acid alphabets to encode hexapeptides [ 43 ] and Random-forest classifier to predict amyloidogenic hexapeptides.

    (iv) ANuPP is an ensemble of logistic regression models trained on clusters of hexapeptides using atom composition as input features [ 44 ].

    (v) APPNN is a neural network-based method [ 45 ] using physicochemical and biochemical amino acid properties.

    (vi) GAP uses statistical potentials derived from amino acid pair preferences in alternate and adjacent positions of amyloid fibril-forming and amorphous β-aggregating peptides, and Bayesian networks to compute the amyloid probability [ 21 ].

    (vii) PASTA2 predicts β-aggregation based on energy functions for parallel and antiparallel beta-strands derived from a larger dataset of protein structures in comparison with AgMata [ 46 ].

    (viii) TANGO predicts β-aggregation prone regions based on relative preferences for secondary structure conformations in the protein sequence [ 22 ], which is obtained from Boltzmann distribution of empirical/statistically derived energetic terms.

    (ix) WALTZ is a combination of three position-specific sequence information: (a) scoring matrix derived from amyloidogenic hexapeptides, (b) helical, beta and solvation-related hydrophobicity propensities and (c) pseudoenergy matrix derived from in silico mutagenesis of polyalanine microcrystal structures [ 20 ].

Assessment of prediction performance
To assess the prediction performance of protein and peptide aggregation propensity, the total and average aggregation scores for each sequence were obtained from the nine selected aggregation tools. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to obtain the optimum threshold cut-off for every method in each dataset independently to avoid bias towards any single prediction algorithm. The optimum threshold for a dataset is that the threshold value corresponds to the upper-left corner in the ROC curve, calculated from min ((1−TPR) 2  + FPR 2 ). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used for performance comparison. In addition, the following measures were also used.

In the above equations, TP, TN, FP and FN stand for true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative, respectively. Bootstrap sampling ( n  = 1000), Student’s t -test, and Mann–Whitney rank-sum test were performed using SciPy [ 47 ] to assess the statistical significance of the difference in performance. Segment OVerlap (SOV) scores: SOV APR , SOV non-APR , SOV average and SOV overall are used for the evaluation of identification of APR regions in protein sequences [ 48 ]. APR predictions are similar to secondary structure assignment. SOV scores the prediction performance based on the overlap between the predicted and actual and hence appropriate for APR prediction assessment.
Results and discussion
Prediction of peptide amyloidogenicity

The ability of peptide sequences to form amyloid-like fibrils has been extensively studied experimentally and computationally. Hex1421 consists of 512 amyloidogenic and 909 non-amyloidogenic hexapeptides from all experimentally studied sequences over the decades [ 26 , 27 , 32 ]. The dataset has been widely used in the literature as training and validation datasets. Seven out of the nine tools, namely AmyloGram, ANuPP, APPNN, GAP, PASTA2, TANGO and WALTZ have been either trained or validated using part of the Hex1421 dataset. Supplementary Table S1 , available online at https://academic.oup.com/bib , shows the performance of the nine prediction tools on Hex1421 dataset. AmyloGram, ANuPP, AGGRESCAN and PASTA2 showed a performance with an AUC of greater than 0.8 [ 40 , 43 , 44 , 46 ]. Further, to exclude the bias on the prediction performance, a dataset of 31 hexapeptides ( Hex31 ) was constructed, which was not used for training in any of the methods. The methods AmyloGram, ANuPP, AGGRESCAN and AgMata scored an AUC above 0.75 ( Figure 1 ) and the performance of AmyloGram, ANuPP and AGGRESCAN was consistently better than other methods on these hexapeptide datasets with a minimum accuracy of 75%.

Identification of aggregation prone regions

The performance of prediction tools was tested on a dataset of experimental APR annotation collected from the AmyPro database [ 28 ]. The dataset consists of annotation of 52 APRs in 37 amyloidogenic proteins. The assessments have been carried out using the measures, SOV score [ 48 ], the number of correctly predicted APR and non-APR segments. An APR/non-APR segment is considered correctly predicted if at least 50% of residues in a segment are correctly classified. AmyloGram was excluded in the analysis as it was trained to predict amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic peptides and not for predicting the aggregation prone regions in proteins.

Overall, among 52 APRs, the maximum of 11–32 (21–61%) APRs are predicted correctly and SOV APR and SOV overall ranged from 30 to 58.8% and 27.2 to 69.9%, respectively ( Table 2 ). APPNN showed the highest SOV APR of 58.9% and predicted 32 of the 52 APRs correctly. On the other hand, it showed a lower SOV non-APR of 36.4% and predicted only 28 of the 79 non-APR segments correctly. APPNN showed the highest sensitivity to APRs but also exhibited lower specificity. TANGO and WALTZ scored the highest SOV overall of 60.9 and 62%, respectively. The higher SOV overall is a result of higher SOV non-APR since the non-APRs are the majority class. Both TANGO and WALTZ showed higher specificity and lower sensitivity, respectively. As a result, they predicted 67 and 69 of 79 non-APRs correctly, respectively, but identified only 12 APRs. ANuPP, AGGRESCAN and PASTA2 showed a balanced sensitivity and specificity with SOV overall of 57, 47 and 44.6%, respectively. These three methods predicted 28–32 (54–60%) APRs and 41–54 (52–68%) non-APRs correctly. These results highlight the necessity of new robust methods to identify APRs accurately.

Amyloidogenicity of IAPP variants

IAPP is a 37-residue intrinsically disordered hormone protein known to form amyloid in vitro and in vivo . Interestingly, the amyloidogenicity of IAPP is known to vary among different species [ 49 , 50 ]. In recent work, Palato et al . [ 35 ] studied the amyloidogenicity of 12 different naturally occurring full-length animal variants of IAPP by measuring the fibrillization using Thioflavin T binding and atomic force microscopy. Among 12 homologous protein sequences, 4 sequences which contained hexapeptides from Hex1421 were removed to avoid redundancy with the hexapeptide dataset. Figure 2 shows the predicted normalized aggregation scores (0–1) for the variants. Overall, most prediction methods showed excellent accuracy (>80%). AGGRESCAN showed the highest performance with a perfect ROC and AUC of 1 (Supplementary Table S2 available online at https://academic.oup.com/bib ). AmyloGram, ANuPP, PASTA2, GAP and TANGO showed better performance with AUC in the range of 0.8–0.93 and an accuracy of 87.5%.

AGGRESCAN predicted score showed excellent correlation with the observed data with 100% accuracy (AUC = 1) in distinguishing the fibril forming and non-forming homologous proteins. ANuPP, TANGO, PASTA2, GAP and AmyloGram also scored accuracy greater than 85% (AUC≥0.8, Supplementary Table S2 available online at https://academic.oup.com/bib).

Amyloidogenicity of the immunoglobulin light chain variable regions

Light chain amyloidosis is the most common type of systemic amyloidosis and characterized by the deposition of immunoglobulin light chains in extracellular tissue [ 4 , 51 ]. Amyloidogenicity of the light chains is attributed to the variable regions commonly observed in the tissue deposits [ 52 ]. A set of 678 light chain variable region sequences, including 356 kappa and 322 lambda subtypes, was obtained from the ALBase ( http://albase.bumc.bu.edu/ ) (see Material and Methods section). These variable regions share high sequence similarity and can be clustered to four sequences at 40% sequence identity cut-off. Overall, we observed that all the methods showed poor performance in distinguishing the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic light variable sequences ( Table 3 ). The AUC varied from 0.374 to 0.674. Among the nine predictors: APPNN, ANuPP and AmyloGram showed better performance with AUC of 0.674, 0.606 and 0.579 and accuracy of 62.4, 59.2 and 59.8%, respectively.

Prediction of protein aggregating propensity

Fold-Agg77 consists of 46 proteins whose folding kinetics have been experimentally studied and 31 aggregating protein sequences [ 36–38 ]. Overall, the performance of methods as measured through AUC varied from 0.290 to 0.810. APPNN, TANGO and GAP showed the highest performance with an AUC of 0.810, 0.808 and 0.788 and accuracy of 79.3, 78.3 and 76%, respectively. AGGRESCAN, AmyloGram, ANuPP and PASTA2 showed similar performance with AUC between 0.720 and 0.743 and accuracy in the range of 70.5–74.2%.
Solubility and aggregation

Most often, aggregation is correlated with the solubility of proteins in solution. Proteins with higher aggregation propensity tend to separate from the bulk solution by coagulating or precipitating. Though the prediction of protein solubility is a significant problem, it is also a tricky one because of the subjectiveness of the definition of solubility itself for proteins. We tested the ability of aggregation prediction tools to distinguish the soluble and insoluble proteins using Ecoli2151 dataset [ 39 ]. These datasets were developed initially by Niwa et al . [ 39 ] and used previously by Agostini et al . [ 38 ] to develop the ccSOL. Overall, the AUC and accuracy varied in the range 0.568–0.777 and 55.9–71.7%, respectively ( Table 5 ). PASTA2, APPNN, ANuPP and GAP showed better performance with an AUC of 0.777, 0.757, 0.747 and 0.740 and accuracy of 71.7, 70.1, 70.2 and 69.6%, respectively, than other methods. WALTZ and TANGO showed similar performance with AUC between 0.732 and 0.714 and accuracy in the range of 67.4–65.1%. This analysis highlights that the predicted aggregation scores could be used as a feature in the development of protein solubility prediction methods.

The results presented in Table 6 showed that the performance of prediction methods varied across different datasets. For example, APPNN outperformed ANuPP on ALBase678, Fold-Agg77 and Sol2151 datasets. However, it underperformed in Hex1421, Hex31 and Amy37 datasets.

APPNN is a neural network model, trained on 296 hexapeptides and validated on a dataset of 483 peptides/protein sequences of varying lengths (>6 residues). The accuracy of the model in training and validation datasets are 78% [confidence interval (CI): 72.6–82.4%] and 84.9% [CI: 81.2–87.6%] [ 45 ]. We observed a similar trend in our analysis that APPNN performed better on protein sequences than hexapeptides. Moreover, the performance in the Hex1421 dataset is similar to the training dataset with an accuracy of 70.6% [CI: 68–73.1%].

AGGRESCAN, which is based on in vivo experiments on change in aggregation propensity among Amyloid-β mutants [ 41 , 49 ], showed a moderate performance in all datasets except ALBase678. Though the method was not trained on hexapeptides, it showed an AUC of 0.838 in Hex1421 dataset. The observed prediction performance could be attributed to the amino acid level features of AGGRESCAN. ALBase678 is a challenging dataset of light chain variable sequences. These sequences are highly redundant with conserved framework regions and islands of variable CDR regions. ANuPP and APPNN showed the highest performance with an accuracy of 58.2 and 62.4% (AUC: 0.606 and 0.674), respectively. Both these methods were trained on hexapeptide datasets, and their robustness was tested on validation datasets as well as several cross-validation procedures. ANuPP is modeled with ensemble of logistic regression equations, whereas APPNN is based on artificial neural network. These results highlight the importance of large diverse datasets and robust model architecture to improve the performance of a method.

Ecoli2151 dataset is an extended inclusion in our analysis. Interestingly, four of the nine methods scored about 70% accuracy (AUC > 0.74), which indicates the inverse relationship between solubility and aggregation. Although AgMata and PASTA 2.0 were developed using beta-strand pairing scores, AgMata showed the least performance of 55.9% accuracy (AUC: 0.568). A similar trend was also observed in Fold-Agg77 dataset, where PASTA 2.0 (AUC = 0.722) showed better performance than AgMata (AUC = 0.29). The significant difference in these methods was mainly in the formulation and pair potentials used in these models [ 42 , 53 ].

In summary, the performance of an aggregation prediction method depends on the model architecture, input features along with the training and validation datasets.
Conclusions

Several prediction algorithms and tools have been developed in the last two decades to predict beta-aggregation propensity and amyloidogenicity. Similar to experimental techniques, the development of in silico methods requires cycles of validation and refinement. In this current work, we have assessed the performance of nine different aggregation prediction tools on six diverse datasets. Some of these tools were developed to predict beta-aggregation in proteins, and others were trained to predict amyloid fibril formation. While some of these tools were trained on hexapeptide dataset, others were based on statistical analysis and scoring functions derived from sequence and structural dataset. Despite the difference, most methods showed good predictive power on the solubility dataset. Simultaneously, the ALBase dataset of highly similar immunoglobulin light chain variable regions proved to be a challenge for all the methods. Our analysis stresses the importance of benchmark datasets in the development of any tool. The current work provides a platform for further developing protein aggregation prediction tools to take advantage of the diverse datasets and suggests scope for improvement.
Key Points

    Systematically evaluated the performance of aggregation prediction tools on diverse curated datasets.

    Performance of a method depends on the type of datasets such as hexapeptides, protein sequences, amyloidogenic antibody light chains and soluble protein sequences.

    The method, ANuPP uniformly predicts well in all the datasets

    Provides insights to the scientific community to select a suitable method for prediction.
