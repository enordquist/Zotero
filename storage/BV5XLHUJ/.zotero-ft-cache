Abstract
Stunning advances have been achieved in addressing the protein folding problem, providing deeper
understanding of the mechanisms by which proteins navigate energy landscapes to reach their native
states and enabling powerful algorithms to connect sequence to structure. However, the realities of the
in vivo protein folding problem remain a challenge to reckon with. Here, we discuss the concept of the
“proteome folding problem”—the problem of how organisms build and maintain a functional
proteome—by admitting that folding energy landscapes are characterized by many misfolded states
and that cells must deploy a network of chaperones and degradation enzymes to minimize deleterious
impacts of these off-pathway species. The resulting proteostasis network is an inextricable part of
in vivo protein folding and must be understood in detail if we are to solve the proteome folding problem.
We discuss how the development of computational models for the proteostasis network’s actions and the
relationship to the biophysical properties of the proteome has begun to offer new insights and capabilities.

The Protein Folding Problem
In 1958, Kendrew et al . published the first three-
dimensional model of the structure of a globular
protein, sperm whale myoglobin. Although the
resolution was only 6  A, the complexity of the
structure was abundantly clear and led the authors
to remark: “The arrangement seems to be almost
totally lacking in the kind of regularities which one
instinctively anticipates, and it is more complicated
than has been predicted by any theory of protein
structure”.1 This complexity became even more
apparent in later, higher resolution structures of
myoglobin.2 In parallel with these studies, Anfinsen
and others were studying the process of protein fold-
ing using bovine pancreatic ribonuclease as a model
protein. They discovered that the complicated struc-
tures reported by Kendrew and others seemed to be
the thermodynamically most stable conformations
that could be adopted by polypeptide chains. More-
over, they showed that these structures could be
attained without assistance from any external bio-
logical machinery, despite their complexity.3–6
These two lines of work immediately suggested that
protein primary structures contain all the information
needed to produce the rich complexity evident in
protein tertiary structures. And so, the protein folding
problem was born.
The protein folding problem has dominated
protein science for the past 60 years. There are
many definitions of it, but we prefer Dill’s three-
part formulation7,8: (1) how do we predict a protein’s
three-dimensional tertiary structure from its one-
dimensional primary structure? (2) how do the vari-

ous intra- and intermolecular interactions in the sys-
tem (protein–protein, protein-solvent, and solvent–
solvent) determine this three-dimensional struc-
ture? and (3) what is (are) the pathway(s) by which
it is formed? Tremendous progress has been made
on all three aspects of the protein folding problem,
and this progress has been accelerating as more
powerful computational and experimental methods
have been brought to bear.9 This past year, how-
ever, we witnessed an extraordinary advance
toward a solution to the protein folding problem in
the performance of AlphaFold, an artificial intelli-
gence program developed by DeepMind to predict
protein structures. In CASP14 (the 14th running of
the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction
competition), AlphaFold was able to predict the
three-dimensional structures of an array of proteins
with a median accuracy that was as high as that of
models built from experimental data.10,11 The
potential utility of this algorithm was recently power-
fully demonstrated by predicting the structures of
almost every protein in the human proteome.12
While AlphaFold cannot be considered a compre-
hensive solution to the protein folding problem—it
addresses only the first of the three questions that
make up the protein folding problem as defined
above—we believe that it probably will mark a
new era in protein science. As such this seems like
a suitable moment to pause and consider what chal-
lenges might define the next 60 years of protein
science the way that the protein folding problem
has defined the last 60.
The Proteome Folding Problem
The protein folding problem focuses on one
outcome that can occur when an unstructured
protein is placed under native conditions: folding
to the functional native structure. However, it has
long been known that folding is not so
straightforward for many (if not most) proteins,
and that other, more untoward outcomes are
possible.13 Proteins can become trapped in mis-
folded conformations that represent local minima
on their folding energy landscapes.14,15 This is
especially true for longer proteins with more compli-
cated topologies, which are underrepresented
among proteins for which detailed in vitro folding
studies have been done.16 This situation can be
visualized with a folding energy landscape that
contains more than one deep minimum, as sug-
gested by Clark in 2004.15 Such a folding energy
landscape is depicted in Figure 1. If these misfolded
conformers are abundant enough and persist for
long enough, they can self-associate to form aggre-
gates that are virtually never salutary to a cell and
are usually toxic, especially in their early stages of
formation.17–20 Even if misfolded proteins did not
aggregate, it is very unlikely that they would be func-
tional, and such a loss-of-function could be devas-
tating.17,19,20 Moreover, many different proteins
are present simultaneously in vivo, a feature of the
proteome folding problem that introduces major
complexity. To mitigate the effects of protein mis-
folding, all organisms from the time of the last uni-
versal common ancestor have had a network of
cellular components that is tasked with maintaining
protein homeostasis, or “proteostasis”, which is the
condition of an organism having enough properly
folded proteins to carry out the functions essential
to life but not so much misfolded/aggregated protein
as to interfere with these functions.21,22
Recognizing that protein folding is not an ideal
process and that there is biological machinery that
exists to help it along raises a different problem
that has been gaining recognition over the past
two decades14–19,23,24 and that we believe will
become one of the dominant questions in protein
science going forward: the proteome folding prob-
lem . In our view, the proteome folding problem
can be broken into two questions. The first is still
intrinsic to protein sequences under a given set of
conditions: what alternative states are competitive
with the native state, either thermodynamically or
kinetically or both, on the protein folding energy
landscape as it exists in living cells? This question
subsumes the original protein folding problem, but
it also requires an understanding of the energetics
of non-native states, which would have been con-
sidered decoys or incorrect solutions in the context
of the original protein folding problem. In addition, it
includes issues relating to the environment within
cells. Many environmental variables that can pro-
foundly influence protein folding vary not only
between cells but also within cells—from organelle
to organelle and potentially even between liquid–liq-
uid phase separated domains in a single orga-
nelle.25–29 These variables include but are not
limited to: the pH; the concentrations of ions and
osmolytes30–32; and macromolecular crowding.33–35
The second question in the proteome folding
problem is largely extrinsic to protein sequences:
how do components of the biological folding
machinery, the “proteostasis network”, interact
with proteins to optimize protein folding outcomes,
or when folding fails, how do they mitigate the
impact of protein folding failures? We examine
these questions in the following sections.
Non-Native States of Proteins and the
Cellular Folding Environment
A useful example of the non-native states of
proteins comes from work by the Anfinsen lab on
ribonuclease folding.4,15 Ribonuclease has eight
cysteine residues that can form four disulfide bonds.
There are 105 possible pairings of these cysteines
as disulfides, only one of which allows native folding
and function. Re-folding reduced and denatured
ribonuclease under conditions that permit cysteine
