Abstract
Hsp70 chaperones have been implicated in assisting protein folding of newly synthesized polypeptide chains, refolding of misfolded proteins, and protein trafficking. For these functions, the chaperones need to exhibit a significant promiscuity in binding to different sequences of hydrophobic peptide stretches. To characterize the structural basis of sequence specificity and flexibility of the Escherichia coli Hsp70 chaperone DnaK, we have analyzed crystal structures of the substrate binding domain of the protein in complex with artificially designed peptides as well as small proline-rich antimicrobial peptides. The latter peptides from mammals and insects were identified to target DnaK after cell penetration. Interestingly, the complex crystal structures reveal two different peptide binding modes. The peptides can bind either in a forward or in a reverse direction to the conventional substrate binding cleft of DnaK in an extended conformation. Superposition of the two binding modes shows a remarkable similarity in the side chain orientations and hydrogen bonding pattern despite the reversed peptide orientation. The DnaK chaperone has evolved to bind peptides in both orientations in the substrate binding cleft with comparable energy without rearrangements of the protein. Optimal hydrophobic interactions with binding pockets − 2 to 0 appear to be the main determinant for the orientation and sequence position of peptide binding.

Introduction
Hsp70 molecular chaperones are essential for the protein quality control machinery that is involved in folding and translocation of newly synthesized proteins as well as refolding and degradation of misfolded proteins.1 These proteins enable cell survival in stress conditions such as heat shock, which result in an increased concentration of misfolded and aggregated proteins. The chaperones bind to denatured protein sequence stretches by recognizing exposed hydrophobic regions that are normally buried in the core of the correctly folded protein.2,3 Hsp70 proteins consist of an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD), which has ATPase activity, and a C-terminal substrate binding domain (SBD).4 The NBD is important for the regulation of peptide binding and release via ATP binding.5 In the ATP-bound state, the substrate affinity is low and Hsp70 adopts an open state for

peptide binding. After peptide binding, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and the chaperone adopts a closed state that exhibits an ~ 10-fold increased affinity for the peptides. Following exchange of ADP with ATP, Hsp70 switches again to the low-affinity state and the peptide is released. In vivo, cochaperones are involved in the chaperone cycle to stimulate ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange. The Escherichia coli chaperone DnaK is currently the best characterized member of the Hsp70 chaperone system, which exists in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
DnaK consists of a 42-kDa NBD and a 27-kDa SBD. The SBD is further subdivided into a 12-kDa βsubdomain, which contains the substrate binding site and a 15-kDa α-helical subdomain, which forms a lid that covers the substrate binding cleft and stabilizes the loop regions of the β-subdomain. The last 30 amino acids of the helical domain are unstructured.4 NBD and SBD are connected by a

Binding Modes of Peptides to DnaK

short conserved interdomain linker, which is involved in the interdomain communication.1,6 Recently, two DnaK structures provided new insight into the chaperone cycle of DnaK.7,8 In the ADP-bound state, the domains do not interact and are connected by a flexible interdomain linker resulting in a closed conformation of the helical lid that covers the substrate binding site. In contrast, ATP binding brings both domains closer together by binding of the linker region in a groove formed by the NBD.8 The lid is flipped away from the substrate binding cavity in order to interact transiently with the NBD. In this conformation, the substrate binding cleft has a low affinity for peptide substrates.
Information on the substrate specificity of DnaK was first obtained from binding assays on peptide libraries via phage display9 and cellulose-bound peptide scans.3 These studies showed that the binding peptides contained a core of three to five hydrophobic residues flanked by polar, predominantly positively charged residues. From these screens, the heptapeptide NRLLLTG emerged as a good DnaK binding peptide.9 The first crystal structure of DnaK was determined in complex with this peptide, showing that the peptide binds in an extended conformation to a cleft of ~ 15 Å length for the seven amino acids of the peptide.4 L4 binds to a central hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of I401, F426, V436, I438, I472, and V474. Later studies on DnaK substrate specificity used this structural information to develop predictors for DnaK binding peptide stretches. Based on molecular modeling and force field calculations, Kasper et al.10 found that the nonpolar interactions are energetically the predominant contributions for binding and that these are due to three central hydrophobic residues of the heptapeptide. The most detailed information on the specificity of DnaK to date was obtained from a large peptide binding scan including the structural information to align the binding sequences to the DnaK binding pockets to obtain a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM, Table S3).11
To further our understanding of the structural basis of the substrate specificity and promiscuity of Hsp70 chaperones, we determined the co-crystal structures of the SBD of DnaK with designed peptides and proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs). PrAMPs penetrate the bacterial cell membrane in a non-lytic way. In the cytoplasm, the peptides interfere with the function of essential proteins involved in protein synthesis and transport, including chaperones.12 The chaperone DnaK was identified to bind to the PrAMPs pyrrhocoricin, drosocin, apidaecin, and oncocin and is discussed as a major target protein for PrAMPs.13–18 Selectivity as antimicrobial agents is achieved by the control of cell penetration. In apidaecin and pyrrhocoricin, the Cterminus is responsible for cell penetration into

Gram-negative bacteria, the N-terminus for DnaK binding.16–18 For pyrrhocoricin, in vitro binding to human Hsc70 was shown,17 but PrAMPs do not penetrate the eukaryotic cell membrane. 18,19
Crystal structures in complex with short peptides or PrAMPs are available for the SBD of DnaK. 4,15,16,18 In the peptides NRLLLTG, pyrrhocoricin_LYZ, and oncocin Onc72, a leucine binds in a deep hydrophobic pocket of the substrate binding cleft.4,15,16 In apidaecin Api88(3–11), the central DnaK binding pocket is occupied by an isoleucine in one of two DnaK molecules within the asymmetric unit.18 In the second molecule, a proline residue binds in reverse direction to this pocket but its binding mode is influenced by crystal packing interactions. A reverse binding orientation was also reported for the complex of the peptide IscU with the SBD of HscA, a DnaK-related Hsc70 protein in E. coli. A proline occupies the central binding pocket in this structure.20 The contribution of the high content of prolines in PrAMPs for DnaK binding has not been investigated yet and remains to be established. The proline residues in these peptides restrict the peptide flexibility and may thus reduce the loss of entropy upon binding.
Understanding of the molecular basis of the DnaK substrate specificity is important not only for a characterization of the chaperone function but also for biotechnological applications of the chaperone in protein production. Our studies reveal the structural basis for the ability of DnaK to bind peptides in the forward as well as reverse orientation and the sequence-specific properties that determine the peptide binding modes. Furthermore, we characterized the influence of peptide binding on the ATPase rate in order to study the allosteric coupling of the peptide-bound SBD with the NBD.
Results
We determined 14 crystal structures of the SBD (amino acids 389 to 607) of DnaK in complex with the peptides listed in Table 1. The structures were obtained in four different crystal forms (Table 2). According to the peptide binding orientation, the structures can be divided into two groups: the forward and reverse binding modes. Crystal structures of the forward binding peptides NRLLLTG, pyrrhocoricin_LYZ (Z stands for cyclohexylalanine), and oncocin have been analyzed before and show that a leucine binds to the central hydrophobic binding pocket.4,15,16 In this study, we first analyze the forward binding mode of pyrrhocoricin-related peptides with the sequence YXPRP with X = L, I, S. In further structures, we investigate the influence and interactions of the amino acid in the central hydrophobic pocket. To investigate the binding of designed non-natural peptides, we studied the

For each peptide, the amino acid binding forward or reverse to the central pocket of DnaK is highlighted in red. Amino acids binding to the hydrophobic pockets −1 and −2 are marked in green. Amino acids visible in the electron density are typed in bold letters. The other residues are disordered (flexible). aThis work. bZ, cyclohexylalanine. cO, ornithine. dChex, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. eBb, bumblebee, amino acid numbering according to Api88.18 fFor these complexes, the Kd value or AC50 value was not determined. The assay could not be applied to the self-associating DnaK dimer. gThe values for the buried DnaK surfaces were calculated with the program dssp21 by addition of the individual molecular surfaces of DnaK and peptide followed by subtraction of the complex surface divided by 2 (1/2 · (P + L − PL)). hThe server http://limbo.switchlab.org was used to calculate the score. The server is not useable for non-proteinogenic amino acid sequences. In addition, amino acid sequences with missing residues within pockets −3 to +3 cannot be analyzed. If two scores are given, the first value corresponds to the observed binding mode. The second value specifies the score for the predicted optimal binding mode (with the specified amino acid in the central pocket). Thus, if only one value is given, the predicted binding mode was observed in the crystal structure. For the reverse binding peptides, the first value specifies a pseudo-score that was calculated in the following way. The limbo server was developed for the prediction of forward binding peptides and an evaluation of reverse binding sequences is not directly possible. Therefore, the score for the heptapeptide residues in reverse binding mode were calculated for a forward binding mode such that the same side chains bind to the DnaK binding sites as observed in the crystal structures. The second value again specifies the best forward binding mode as predicted by the limbo server.

binding mode of variants of NRLLLTG, in which the central leucine was mutated to isoleucine and methionine. Surprisingly, these structures resulted in different peptide binding modes. In the last section, we describe the interactions of reverse binding peptides. Starting from the model peptide ELPLVKI, which was spectroscopically shown to bind in a reverse orientation,22 we analyzed variants with high sequence similarity to the C-terminal part of pyrrhocoricin, which contains a palindromic sequence nearly reverse to the N-terminal forward binding sequence stretch.
PrAMPs binding in the forward binding mode
Pyrrhocoricin-related peptides with sequence motif YLPRP bind in the forward binding mode
In addition to the pyrrhocoricin derivative pyrrhocoricin_LYZ16 and oncocin Onc72,15 native pyrrhocoricin from Pyrrhocoris apterus, PR-39(1–15) from pig, and the designer peptide A3-APO(1–20)21 bind also in a forward direction to the conventional substrate binding cleft of DnaK (Fig. 1g). This “forward binding mode” is defined in Fig. 1. The peptides form strong contacts with the β-subdomain, whereas the α-helical subdomain is a lid that covers the substrate binding cleft and stabilizes loop regions of the β-domain (Fig. 1a). All these peptides share the sequence motif YLPRP, which binds to the substrate binding cleft. Leucine is the most important amino acid within this stretch because it occupies the central hydrophobic pocket, in the following designated as pocket 0 (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, hydrophobic amino acids are preferred at the two positions N-

terminal to the central leucine, since they can form additional interactions with the predominantly hydrophobic − 1 and − 2 binding sites (Fig. 1b–f). In pyrrhocoricin_LYZ, amino acids GSY preceding the leucine in native pyrrhocoricin were mutated to LYZ (Z denotes the non-proteinogenic amino acid cyclohexylalanine), leading to better hydrophobic contacts to these binding sites.16 Tyrosine in position − 1 in native pyrrhocoricin, Onc72, PR-39(1–15), and A3APO(1–20) also fits well to the hydrophobic − 1 site. Position − 2 is occupied by a serine in pyrrhocoricin, which probably does not contribute strongly to peptide binding in the relatively hydrophobic environment and by a proline in A3-APO(1–20), Onc72, and PR-39. These binding preferences are in good agreement with the Kd values determined by fluorescence polarization (Table 1; Fig. S1). For pyrrhocoricin_LYZ and pyrrhocoricin(1–11)_LYZ, the Kd values are 0.17 ± 0.01 μM and 0.41 ± 0.02 μM and approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than those for pyrrhocoricin and pyrrhocoricin(1–11) with 2.2 ± 0.4 μM and 4.6 ± 0.6 μM, respectively, showing that hydrophobic and bulky amino acids N-terminal to the central leucine increase affinity for peptides binding in the forward binding mode. The amino acids Cterminal to the leucine form fewer interactions with DnaK, indicating that more different amino acids at sequence positions + 1 to + 3 would support binding in the observed binding mode (Fig. 1g). This is supported by the PSSM scores (Table S3), which show more residues with a large negative score in positions − 2, − 1, and 0 compared to the other positions. In all peptides discussed in this section, the sequence motif PRP binds to positions + 1 to + 3 (Fig. 1g). This is in very good agreement with the

PSSM scores, as prolines are favored at sites + 1 and + 3 and strongly disfavored at − 3 to 0. Further evidence of the importance of hydrophobic amino acids within the DnaK binding region is provided by drosocin, which has a high sequence identity to the other pyrrhocoricin-related peptides, but contains a serine instead of a leucine in the central binding motif: YSPRP. As a result, drosocin(1–11) has a significantly higher Kd value of 43.3 ± 8.7 μM. If this serine is replaced by leucine (peptide drosocin_S7L), a much lower Kd value of 1.4 ± 0.2 μM is obtained. A3APO(1–20) has an identical sequence as drosocin_S7L in the binding region and is with 0.41 ± 0.01 μM among the best binding PrAMPs. R7 in the − 3 binding site may form additional hydrogen bonds with its guanidine group, which most likely contributes to the good Kd value, although the electron density of the side chain is not defined, indicating flexibility (Fig. 1b).
All peptides discussed in this section were obtained in space group II, in which two DnaK monomers are arranged within the asymmetric unit. In monomer B, the peptide binding mode is not influenced by crystal packing interactions in contrast to monomer A, where the peptide chain makes a kink after the leucine binding to pocket 0 to avoid steric clashes with a neighboring DnaK monomer (Fig. 1h). For all shown superpositions, only the unaffected monomer B is used. By using a shorter construct in the variant pyrrhocoricin(1–10)_LYZI (discussed later), the two monomers within the asymmetric unit of crystal form II exhibit an identical peptide binding mode as observed in monomer B in the longer peptide structures. All peptides discussed in this section form approximately five strong hydrogen bonds (≤ 3 Å) to DnaK via the peptide backbone (Fig. 1h). Considering the comparable number of hydrogen bonds, a comparison of the Kd values of pyrrhocoricin(1–11) and pyrrhocoricin_LYZ(1–11) indicates that the kind of amino acid side chain binding to DnaK pockets − 2 to 0 plays a major role for the binding affinities of these peptides.

Apidaecin Bb(3–11) binds with an isoleucine to binding pocket 0
Apidaecin Bb(3–11), a peptide fragment from bumblebee apidaecin, comprises a similar sequence stretch as the pyrrhocoricin-related peptides (YIPPP) and binds in crystal form I in a similar manner in a forward binding orientation with isoleucine in binding pocket 0 (Fig. 2a and b). A slight downward shift of the pyrrolidine ring of P9 away from the protein compared to A3-APO(1–20) is observed (Fig. 2b). This most likely results from the presence of the larger isoleucine side chain in the central pocket 0. Without the observed shift, the Cβ atom of the isoleucine would clash with the Cδ atom of the pyrrolidine ring (Fig. 2b). Despite the shift, the carbonyl group of P9 binds to a similar position as the carbonyl group of P11 in A3-APO(1–20) but forms a less strong hydrogen bond to T437. Pyrrhocoricin(1–10)_LYZI (analyzed in crystal form II, discussed in the next section) binds identical with apidaecin Bb(3–11) with an isoleucine in the central pocket and shows a similar downward shift of the pyrrolidine ring of P8 (Fig. 3b). Api88(3–11), an optimized apidaecin derivative, has a very similar sequence as Bb(3–11) (Table 1). Recently, we published its forward binding mode in crystal form V, which is similar to that of apidaecin Bb(3–11) in crystal form I,18 confirming this binding mode in two independent crystal forms.
A superposition of apidaecin Bb(3–11) in crystal form I with the published binding mode of the prolinefree peptide NRLLLTG in crystal form I4 shows similar binding modes with differences only for P5, P10, and P11 of apidaecin Bb(3–11) (Fig. 2a).

to LYZ in binding sites − 3 to − 1 decreases the Kd value by 1 order of magnitude as shown above. We tested the binding of a variant peptide, in which the leucine binding to pocket 0 was replaced by cyclohexylalanine (Z). Z completely fills binding pocket 0 in the structure of pyrrhocoricin(1–11) _LYZZ (Fig. 3a). The Kd value is improved to 0.08 ± 0.03 μM compared to 0.41 ± 0.02 μM of pyrrhocoricin_LYZ. In the derivative pyrrhocoricin(1–10)_LYZI, the central pocket is occupied by the isoleucine. The Kd value was determined to 0.35 ± 0.01 μM. Together, these findings demonstrate that for the forward binding mode, the central hydrophobic pocket is best filled by amino acids Z N L ~ I. Interestingly, the size of the central pocket 0 is increased in the complex structure with pyrrhocoricin_LYZ (Fig. 3a) compared to pyrrhocoricin(1–10)_LYZI (Fig. 3b) to accommodate the larger cyclohexyl moiety. This increase results from a change in the side chain rotamer of I438 and from an ~ 0.8 Å shift of residues I401. The fact that these conformational changes are accompanied by an increased affinity of the peptide with Z in the 0 pocket indicates that there is no large energetic cost associated with the movement of these residues. A similar plasticity of the central hydrophobic pocket has not been observed in previous DnaK structures.
Structural studies of NRLXLTG (X = L, I, M) peptides
To further investigate the binding of isoleucine and methionine to the central hydrophobic pocket, we synthesized variants of the NRLLLTG peptide with methionine and isoleucine replacing L4 to study the influence of this residue on peptide binding. For NRLLLTG, it was previously shown that L4 occupies the central binding pocket (Fig. 4a).4 Surprisingly, NRLMLTG binds not with M4 but with L5 to pocket 0 (Fig. 4b). In this binding mode, L3 and M4 fit well to the binding sites − 2 and − 1, respectively. To verify this difference in the binding modes of the similar peptides, we also

crystallized NRLLLTG with DnaK. Similar to the binding mode of NRLMLTG, NRLLLTG also binds with L5 to the central pocket (Fig. 4a–c). The complex structures of DnaK with NRLLLTG and NRLMLTG were obtained in space groups III and II, respectively, after seeding with pyrrhocoricin_LYZ crystals grown in crystal form II (crystallization conditions are shown in Table S2). The previously reported structure of NRLLLTG with L4 in the central pocket was obtained in crystal form I.4 In the binding mode of the peptides in crystal forms II and III, the three consecutive hydrophobic and bulky side chains bind to binding sites − 2, − 1, and 0, which are also of predominantly hydrophobic nature. The different binding modes may be influenced by crystal packing interactions. In crystal forms II and III, peptide binding appears not to be restricted by crystal packing interactions. In crystal form I, the DnaK molecules are packed more tightly. The N-terminus of peptide NRLLLTG forms a hydrogen bond with 3.1 Å distance to a neighboring Q534 side chain. However, apidaecin Bb(3–11) was also crystallized in crystal form I (discussed above) and accommodates a larger N-terminal overhang left to the central binding pocket. It thus appears likely that the peptide NRLLLTG is not restricted to shift one position to the left in this crystal form to adopt the binding mode observed by us in crystal form III. More importantly, an NMR structure of NRLLLTG with DnaK(389–507) confirmed the binding mode of NRLLLTG obtained in crystal form I.4,23 We assume that several almost isoenergetic binding modes exist for these peptides and that the obtained binding mode might be influenced by (i) direct packing interactions of the peptide (which are observed only for crystal form I), (ii) indirect packing interactions via slight conformational changes of the DnaK protein that influence peptide binding, and (iii) different buffer conditions. The PSSM score (Table 1) indicates the binding mode in crystal form I as the most favorable binding mode. However, the structure of DnaK in crystal

form I was used in the docking studies and calculation of the binding energies in the alignment of the peptides to obtain the scores.11 Assuming induced-fit effects, this possibly generates a bias such that these binding peptides are assigned to the binding mode observed in crystal form I.
A further surprising result was obtained with the complex structure of peptide NRLILTG. In crystal form I, NRLILTG binds in reverse orientation to DnaK (Fig. 4c) such that L3 is located in the central pocket and I4 and L5 make hydrophobic interactions with binding sites − 1 and − 2, respectively. Independent of the peptide orientation, in all three new complex structures, three hydrophobic and bulky amino acids form interactions with the − 2, − 1, and 0 positions. In addition, the superposition of DnaK × NRLLLTG with DnaK × NRLILTG shows a remarkable similarity in the side chain orientations and hydrogen bonding pattern despite the opposite binding modes of the two peptides (Fig. 4c). This illustrates an inherent promiscuity or flexibility of the chaperone in binding its target peptides. The hydrophobic interactions with the − 2 to 0 pockets are probably the main determinant for the orientation and sequence position of peptide binding. The Kd values for NRLLLTG, NRLMLTG, and NRLILTG are similar with 1.0 ± 0.3 μM, 1.6 ± 0.5 μM, and 2.56 ± 0.01 μM,

respectively. This is in agreement with the favorable binding of a leucine in the central hydrophobic pocket, methionine, or (iso)leucin in the − 1 pocket and leucine in the − 2 pocket.
Reverse binding mode
Interactions of DnaK with peptide ELPLVKI
The co-crystal structure of the DnaK homolog HscA with the IscU recognition peptide ELPPVKIHC provided first structural information on the reverse binding mode of a peptide to the substrate binding cleft of an Hsp70 chaperone.20 In this structure, the central PVK motif binds to the 0, − 1, and − 2 positions, respectively (Fig. 5a). For DnaK, fluorescence studies for the peptides ELPPVKI and ELPLVKI indicated a strong preference for a reverse binding mode.22 We determined a crystal structure in complex with peptide ELPLVKI, which was obtained in crystal form I. Indeed, this peptide binds in reverse direction to the substrate binding cleft of DnaK with L4 in the central hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 5a and b). A superposition of the DnaK × ELPLVKI and HscA × ELPPVKIHC complexes shows similar binding modes (Fig. 5a). ELPLVKI also superimposes quite well with the

Because of the smaller central hydrophobic pocket in HscA, peptide ELPLVKI does not fit with L4 to this binding site.

reverse binding peptide pyrrhocoricin(12–20), which is discussed in the next section (Fig. 5b). The Kd value is with 6.4 ± 0.6 μM comparable to the forward binding peptides, for example, pyrrhocoricin. ELPPVKI with a Kd value of 9.0 ± 0.9 μM shows a lower binding affinity, most likely due to the less optimal fitting of the smaller proline compared to leucine in the central pocket. Comparing the protein surface of DnaK and HscA with the superimposed peptides shows a steric clash of L4 of peptide ELPLVKI with the central HscA pocket due to its smaller size, which is caused by V436M exchange in HscA (Fig. 5c). Therefore, ELPLVKI might not bind to HscA.
Pyrrhocoricin's dual binding capability
Pyrrhocoricin consists of a nearly palindromic binding sequence, if comparing the C-terminal half of the peptide with sequence PRPIY with the binding motif YLPRP of the N-terminal half, which was shown to bind to DnaK in forward orientation: VDKGSYLPRPTPPRPIYNRN. To investigate if the C-terminal part could also bind to DnaK, we cocrystallized the protein with the peptide fragment pyrrhocoricin(12–20) (Table 1). Indeed, this peptide binds to the conventional substrate binding cleft, but

in reverse direction with the central proline residue of the PRPIY motif in the central hydrophobic pocket 0 (Fig. 6a–c). A superposition of the forward and reverse binding modes of pyrrhocoricin shows that the amino acid side chains are oriented in similar directions and largely occupy the same binding pockets (Fig. 6c).
The proline residue in the central binding pocket probably confers a less favorable hydrophobic effect compared to the leucine in the forward binding peptides as shown above by a comparison of the Kd values of ELPPVKI and ELPLVKI. In the PSSM, proline has a relatively large negative score of − 8 for the central pocket. However, it should be considered that these scores were obtained only based on the forward binding mode and that peptides binding in reverse direction with good affinity might affect the PSSM, since they will be assigned to the predicted lowest energy forward binding mode although the high affinity results from a reverse binding mode.
In the forward binding mode of pyrrhocoricin(1–11) and in the reverse binding mode of pyrrhocoricin(12– 20), hydrophobic residues are present in − 1 and − 2 sites (Fig. 6c). In addition, the number of hydrogenbonding interactions is comparable. The fact that both peptide fragments form a similar number of

The interacting residues are colored as the peptide. (d) Superposition of the intermolecular self-bound and reverse binding sequence (red) to peptide NRLILTG. Methionine is shown in alternative conformations. Residues 386 to 388 originate from the vector sequence; therefore, numbering is subscript. (e) Superposition of the self-bound binding sequence (red) to DnaK × pyrrhocoricin(12–20) (green). The DnaK surface in (d) and (e) is colored based on its hydrophobicity (green: hydrophobic amino acids, white: polar amino acids; calculated with the PyMOL plugin Protscale).

hydrophobic and polar interactions with DnaK is in agreement with the Kd values of 4.6 ± 0.6 μM for pyrrhocoricin(1–11) and 6.3 ± 0.3 μM for pyrrhocoricin(12–20). The Kd value for full-length pyrrhocoricin is 2.2 ± 0.4 μM.
Binding assays of pyrrhocoricin with DnaK and
docking studies indicated an interaction of the peptide with the α-helical domain of the SBD.4,15,16 In all crystal structures analyzed in this work, we
could not identify other binding sites than the conventional peptide binding site between the βdomain and the α-helical lid.

Reverse binding mode of pyrrhocoricin(12–20)related peptides
To further investigate the reverse peptide binding mode, we searched for antimicrobial peptides with high sequence identity to the C-terminal pyrrhocoricin binding motif and determined the binding mode of these peptides or peptide fragments. In drosocin, a peptide from Drosophila melanogaster, the tyrosine of the pyrrhocoricin binding motif PRPIY is changed to an arginine. Drosocin(12–19) binds also in a reverse orientation to DnaK and superposes well

with pyrrhocoricin(12–20) (Fig. 6a). Heliocin(14–21) from the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens also binds to the SBD in reverse direction (Fig. 6b). Proline again occupies the central pocket and valine and isoleucine fit well to the hydrophobic DnaK pockets − 1 and − 2. Hydrogen bonding interactions are similar to the other peptides.
In the course of our work for the preparation of constructs for efficient expression and purification of DnaK, we inadvertently generated a variant that results in the formation of dimers of DnaK(389–607), as indicated by size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). This variant contains the N-terminal fusion tag MGHHHHHHHHHHSSHIEGRHM, which induces dimer formation by binding to the substrate binding cleft of a neighboring DnaK molecule and vice versa (Fig. S2). The RHMVL motif of the fusion tag binds in reverse orientation such that the methionine occupies the central pocket (Fig. 6d and e). The DnaK pockets − 1, − 2, and − 3 are occupied by the bulky and hydrophobic DnaK linker residues V389, L390, and L391 (Fig. 6d and e), forming a stable artificial dimer. This reverse oriented and proline-free sequence stretch superimposes quite well with the also reverse binding proline-free peptide NRLILTG (Fig. 6d). Furthermore, the artificially obtained binding mode resembles that of pyrrhocoricin(12–20), but the binding of the arginine residue in the + 1 pocket differs (Fig. 6e). These differences may result from the reduced flexibility of P15 in the central binding pocket.
Influence of peptide binding on the ATPase activity of DnaK
The DnaK chaperone cycle is controlled via binding of ADP and ATP to the NBD. The ATPbound state is characterized by low peptide affinity and fast exchange rates, whereas in the ADP-bound state, the peptide substrates bind with high affinity and slow exchange rates.6 In addition, the two DnaK domains only interact in the presence of ATP, but are separated in the ADP-bound and nucleotide-free states, connected by a flexible short interdomain linker. The co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE accelerate the chaperone cycle and the associated ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange in vivo. This communication from the NBD to the peptide binding domain is necessary for the function of the chaperone, enabling the release of the tightly bound peptide stretches. However, the communication between the SBD and the NBD is reversible: The NBD has a low intrinsic ATPase activity of ~ 0.9 pmol ATP/μg DnaK/min in good agreement with previous measurements.24,25 This ATPase activity is influenced by peptide binding to the SBD. Binding of pyrrhocoricin to the SBD was described either to stimulate or to inhibit the ATPase activity.17,26,27 To further study the coupling be-

tween the two domains, we measured the influence of peptide binding on the ATPase activity of fulllength DnaK. For each peptide, the concentration was varied between 0 and 300 μM and the ATPase activity was determined with the quantification of phosphate release via a malachite green assay.24 Most of the peptides stimulated the ATPase activity, which is consistent with previous results (Table 1; Fig. 7).17,24,26 The measured ATPase activities in the presence of NRLLLTG and pyrrhocoricin(1–11) _LYZ at 75 μM are 5.9 ± 0.1 pmol ATP/μg DnaK/ min and 0.63 ± 0.04 mol ATP/mol DnaK/min, respectively, and thus in good agreement with the previously reported values of ~ 8 pmol ATP/μg DnaK/min at 75 μM NRLLLTG24 and 0.51 ± 0.02 mol ATP/mol DnaK/min at 64.5 μM pyrrhocoricin(1–11)_LYZ.17 None of our peptides inhibits the ATPase activity, in contrast to a previous report.27 The reported inhibition effect may be caused by the absence of potassium ions in the activity buffer, which are needed for ATP hydrolysis.28–30
Overall, the peptides stimulate the ATPase activity up to 10-fold at high peptide concentrations, although full activation is not achieved for every peptide (Fig. 7a–c). Unexpectedly, drosocin(12–19) shows a very low stimulation despite a relatively good Kd value in contrast to, for example, heliocin(14–21) (Fig. 7b). The Kd values of the peptides are correlated to their AC50 values (the concentration at which 50% activation is achieved) (Fig. 7d). The Kd values for a given peptide are generally lower than the AC50 values since the former are determined in the absence of nucleotides, whereas the latter are determined in the presence of ATP, which reduces peptide affinity. There are a few outliers from a linear correlation, which may be due to specific structural features of the peptides influencing the interdomain communication or it may be that the presence of ATP reduces peptide affinity to a different extent depending on the specific structure of a peptide (Fig. 7d). Another contribution might be that the fluorescence label affects the Kd value for some peptides. More detailed molecular information on the nature of the interdomain communication is needed to understand the influence of peptide binding on ATPase activity.
Discussion
To investigate the structural basis of the preferred binding modes and substrate specificity of DnaK, we determined 14 co-crystal structures with peptides binding in forward and reverse directions. A superposition of all available structures in the forward and reverse binding modes indicates the variability of the main chain and side chain conformations (Fig. 8). In particular, in the vicinity of the residue binding to pocket 0, the conformations are similar, whereas

Fig. 8. Superposition of (a) all forward binding and (b) all reverse binding DnaK–peptide complex structures. The representative molecular surfaces are shown for the forward binding DnaK × pyrrhocoricin(1–11)_LYZZ and the reverse binding artificial N-terminal overhang in complex with DnaK. Furthermore, the protein structure surfaces are colored green for hydrophobic and white for polar regions. For all peptides, carbon atoms are colored beige, oxygen atoms are colored red, nitrogen atoms are colored blue, and sulfur atoms are colored yellow. The β-domain is located in the upper surface, harboring the hydrophobic pocket 0, and forms together with the helical domain in the lower part the peptide binding channel.

more variation is present at the ends of the DnaK peptide binding cleft. Nearly all structures show that both binding orientations form approximately an equal amount of hydrogen bonds and that four carbonyl groups of the peptide backbone in pockets − 2 to + 2 are similarly oriented (Fig. 8a and b). Outside the peptide binding channel, different peptide conformations can be accommodated. Considering the similar binding constants, these findings indicate that the DnaK chaperone has evolved to bind peptides in both orientations in the substrate binding cleft with comparable energy at low micromolar affinities. However, the best binding peptides listed in Table 1 bind in the forward binding mode. Most probably, this is for most reverse binding peptides due to the presence of a proline in the central pocket. It remains to be shown if reverse binding peptides can also achieve submicromolar affinities.
The sequence pattern determines the preferred binding orientation, which is mainly dictated by a hydrophobic fit of the side chains to pockets − 2 to 0. The largest contribution is probably provided by the fitting of medium-sized hydrophobic side chains to the central hydrophobic pocket 0.
Based on the DnaK PSSM,11 binding pockets − 2 and − 1 prefer hydrophobic and bulky amino acid side chains, which is in agreement with the binding mode of pyrrhocoricin_LYZ in which tyrosine and cyclohexylalanine bind to these sites, respectively.16 The frequently occurring proline within PrAMPs is strongly disfavored in positions − 3 to 0 and has a positive score in the remaining positions in the PSSM. This is in agreement with the forward binding pyrrhocoricin-related crystal structures with prolines in pockets + 1 and + 3 (Table 1). The important contribution of all three binding sites − 2 to 0 explains the lower Kd value of pyrrhocoricin(1–11)_LYZ compared to pyrrhocoricin(1–11). In the former

peptide, amino acids GSY binding to pockets − 3 to − 1 were exchanged against the more hydrophobic amino acids LYZ. In our structures, five amino acids occupying the central hydrophobic pocket 0 of DnaK SBD were identified: leucine, isoleucine, proline, cyclohexylalanine, and methionine (Fig. 8). Other bulky hydrophobic amino acids such as phenylalanine or tyrosine probably will not fit to the central binding pocket since the planar aromatic ring does not fit to the pocket in any of its low-energy conformers. Among the binding residues, the large cyclohexylalanine is preferred because of its hydrophobic character and size. By adopting a chair conformation in contrast to the aromatic and planar phenyl ring in phenylalanine, cyclohexylalanine shows a perfect complementary fit to the central DnaK binding pocket, resulting in a fivefold reduced Kd value of pyrrhocoricin_LYZZ (compared to pyrrhocoricin_LYZ). With a Kd value of 80 nM, pyrrhocoricin_LYZZ is the best DnaK binder identified so far. Interestingly, the larger cyclohexyl side chain is accommodated by an induced-fit movement in the central pocket (Fig. 3a).
In addition, introducing an artificial amino acid might increase the peptide half-lives in vivo as reported for the introduction of ornithine, t-leucine, and hydroxyproline in oncocin derivatives.15 Nevertheless, leucine and isoleucine are the preferred amino acids in pocket 0 in the naturally occurring forward binding PrAMPs.
In pyrrhocoricin(12–20) and drosocin(12–19), isoleucine binds to binding site − 1 and proline to pocket 0 in reverse directions in order to form suitable hydrophobic contacts. If these peptides would bind in a forward orientation, the isoleucine could form favorable interactions in pocket 0. However, the proline would then be positioned in binding site − 1 in which bulkier amino acids like cyclohexylalanine are preferred.16,17

Binding Modes of Peptides to DnaK

Table 1 indicates that there is no direct correlation between the buried surface and peptide binding affinity. This is probably due to sequence-specific effects of the magnitude of the side chain interactions and the fact that buried surface only approximates the nonpolar binding contributions. All reverse binding pyrrhocoricin(12–20)-related peptides contribute a higher buried surface than the forward binding pyrrhocoricin-related peptides, although the latter have lower Kd values. For the pyrrhocoricin derivatives pyrrhocoricin(1–11)_LYZZ, pyrrhocoricin(1–11)_LYZ, and native pyrrhocoricin, the improved binding affinity correlates with a larger buried surface.
A calculation of the PSSM scores for the crystallographically observed forward binding modes shows for most structures that the observed binding mode has the lowest score (Table 1). In addition to the NRLLLTG-type peptides in crystal forms II and III, which have been discussed above, different binding modes are predicted for oncocin, PR-39(1– 15), and drosocin(1–11). In all three cases, an arginine is predicted to bind to pocket 0. It is a surprising result of the PSSM that Phe, Arg, and Lys have a neutral score in this hydrophobic pocket; that is, they are not disfavored (Table S3). We suspect that the fact that the peptides were threaded only in the forward binding mode through the DnaK substrate binding groove for the alignment of the sequences causes errors in the PSSM if the peptide has its lowest energy binding mode in the reverse orientation. Furthermore, DnaK shows small but significant structural changes to accommodate different peptide sequences. High-quality crystal structures are needed to obtain a reliable structurebased profile.11 The availability of forward and reverse binding peptides with different residues occupying the substrate binding sites now provides a much larger structural basis for the development of improved DnaK binding profiles. The presence of forward and reverse binding modes and possible induced-fit effects is certainly a challenge for such bioinformatical studies. Interestingly, the pseudoscores calculated for the reverse binding peptides (see Table 1 for details) are mostly positive or close to 0. This indicates that the side-chain preferences of the binding pockets in the forward and reverse binding modes might be similar.
Due to its function as a chaperone in the refolding of many different protein sequences, DnaK is rather promiscuous in peptide binding and shows limited selectivity. The ability to bind peptides in the forward and reverse orientations is an important structural basis for this binding promiscuity. Driven by mainly hydrophobic “greasy” interactions, it can easily happen that even small sequence changes such as the exchange of a leucine by an isoleucine in the peptides NRLLLTG and NRLILTG changes the peptide binding orientation. It is difficult to establish

to what extent crystal packing forces influence the observed binding modes. Therefore, it is important that the low-energy peptide binding modes in the forward and reverse directions have been analyzed by a comparison of many co-crystal structures in different crystal forms in this study. In crystal forms I, II and III, which have been mostly used in this study, only in crystal form I is a direct contact of the peptide with a neighboring molecule in the crystal observed.
In summary, the structural and biochemical data presented in this work expand our knowledge on the specificity and promiscuity of DnaK in peptide binding, in particular concerning the reverse binding orientation and the involvement of induced-fit effects in substrate binding. The high-resolution crystal structures form a basis for the improvement of quantitative DnaK binding predictors by bioinformatical techniques that incorporate structural as well as binding data. NMR studies are needed to establish the binding orientation and possibly the occupancy of almost isoenergetical binding modes in solution.
Methods
Expression, crystallization, and structure determination
The SBD of E. coli DnaK (residues 389 to 607) was initially cloned into a pET 16b vector (Novagen) via restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI with a stop codon directly after the last coding amino acid at the C-terminus. The expressed DnaK formed an artificial dimeric complex (Fig. S2). To prevent dimer formation for further DnaK– peptide studies, we cloned DnaK(389–607) into a modified pET15b vector (Novagen) with an inserted tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site via restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI. The expressed protein contained the Nterminal amino acids MGSSHHHHHHSSGENLYFQ, which were cleaved off by the addition of TEV protease after Q, leaving V389 as the first residue for the DnaK(389–607) construct used in the crystallographic studies. For full-length DnaK, amino acids GGTH remained at the N-terminus after TEV cleavage.
The proteins were expressed in E. coli for 4 h at 30 °C after induction with 1 mM IPTG at an OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) of 0.7. Purification included a Ni affinity chromatography step, followed by protease digestion with a His-tagged TEV protein and a second Ni affinity chromatography step to remove the protease and the His-tags. The protein of the flow-through was finally purified with a size-exclusion chromatography step in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 5% glycerol. DnaK(389–607) was concentrated to 16 mg/mL, mixed with peptides at a 1:5 molar ratio (protein:peptide) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.16 Crystals were grown from 2.4 M to 3.2 M ammonium sulfate at pH 4.0 to 9.0 with the hangingdrop vapor diffusion method. In some cases, streak seeding was performed to obtain the desired crystal form (for details, see Table S2). The crystals were directly frozen into liquid nitrogen for crystals grown in a high salt concentration (≥ 2.8 M ammonium sulfate), or otherwise 20% glycerol was added before freezing.

were collected at Bessy or European Synchrotron Radiation Facility synchrotron and were processed using XDS31 and SCALA.32 The phase problem was solved by molecular replacement using Molrep33 and Protein Data Bank ID 1DKZ4 or the structure was just refined starting from Protein Data Bank ID 1DKZ4 or 3DPO.16 Coot34 was used for model building and further refinement was performed with Refmac.35 The programs MolProbity36 and Procheck37 were used to evaluate the final models. PyMOL† was used for the visualization of the protein structure. The identifiers of the deposited structures are listed in Table 1 and in the supplementary information (Table S1).
Peptide synthesis
Peptides were synthesized on Rink amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamine or 4-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin (MultiSynTech GmbH, Witten, Germany) to obtain Cterminal amides or free acids, respectively. Peptide chains were elongated with standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/ t-butyl (Fmoc/tBu)-chemistry using a 25 μmol scale on the multiple synthesizer SYRO2000 (MultiSynTech). Amino acid derivatives (MultiSynTech; Orpegen Pharma GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) or 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (SigmaAldrich) was activated in situ with di-isopropyl carbodiimide in the presence of 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole.38 The final peptides were cleaved with trifluoroacetic acid containing 12.5% (v:v) of a scavenger mixture (1,2-ethandithiol, mcresol, thioanisole, and water, 1:2:2:2) and precipitated with cold diethyl ether after 2 h. The precipitated peptides were washed twice with cold diethyl ether, dried, and purified on a C18-phase using a linear aqueous acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% (v:v) trifluoroacetic acid as ion pair reagent (Jupiter C18-column, 21.2 mm internal diameter, 250 mm length, 15 μm particle size, 30 nm pore size; Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, USA). The molecular weights of all peptides were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (4700 proteomic analyzer; Applied Biosystems GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany).
ATP activity assay of full-length DnaK (1–638) with PrAMPs
The allosteric influence of the interaction of PrAMPs with DnaK SBD on the activity of DnaK NBD was studied using full-length DnaK in a 96-well plate colorimetric assay. Each well contained a volume of 200 μL consisting of 0.6 μM DnaK, peptide (in a concentration range from 0 to 300 μM), 1 mM ATP, 20 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.5. Three measurements were carried out for each peptide concentration. After 2 h, aliquots of 20 μL were transferred into another microtiter plate and 280 μL of a solution containing 0.007% (w/v) malachite green, 0.36% (w/v) ammonium heptamolybdate, and 0.625 M H2SO4 was added. After 15 min, the extinction at 620 nm was measured. The relationship between optical density and concentration of phosphate was obtained by measuring an external phosphate standard.
The graphs illustrating the specific ATPase activity versus concentration of the particular PrAMP were fitted by a hyperbolic equation A = (ax)/(b + x) + c, in which a

represents the specific activity at an infinite peptide concentration, b is the AC50 value of the PrAMP, and c is the intrinsic ATPase activity of full-length DnaK in the absence of added peptide.
Fluorescence polarization assay
For Kd measurements, the listed peptide sequences in Table 1 were labeled with carboxyfluorescein at their Nterminus. The dissociation constants for full-length DnaK and the 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptides were determined in polarization buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaN3, and 2 mM DTT, pH 7.5) at 28 °C. Thus, black 384-well plates (F-shaped, Greiner BioOne GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) were blocked [0.5% (w:v) casein, 10 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer, 0.3 mol/L NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.05% (v:v) Tween 20]. After 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed three times [10 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer, 0.3 mol/L NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.05% (v:v) Tween 20]. Full-length DnaK was transferred to the plates in 21 concentrations from 120 μmol/L to 0.1 nmol/L (a 2-fold dilution series, 40 μL/well) in polarization buffer containing the 5(6)carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptide to be studied at a constant concentration (10 nmol/L). Each dilution series was done in triplicate on the same plate and the assay was repeated at least once. The fluorescence polarization was measured on a PARADIGM™ (Beckman Coulter, Salzburg, Austria) at 28 ± 1 °C using the fluorescence polarization detection cartridge (λexc = 485 nm, λem = 535 nm) in top read position and is shown as millipolarization units (mP). The data were fitted to a nonlinear, dose– response logistical transition [y = a0 + a1/(1 + x/a2)a3] using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm with the dissociation constants (Kd) being represented by the a2 coefficients (SlideWrite, Encinitas, CA, USA).27
