ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION

We have revisited the protein coarse-grained optimized potential for efficient structure prediction (OPEP). The training and validation sets consist of 13 and 16 protein targets. Because optimization depends on details of how the ensemble of decoys is sampled, trial conformations are generated by molecular dynamics, threading, greedy, and Monte Carlo simulations, or taken from publicly available databases. The OPEP parameters are varied by a genetic algorithm using a scoring function which requires that the native structure has the lowest energy, and the native-like structures have energy higher than the native structure but lower than the remote conformations. Overall, we find that OPEP correctly identifies 24 native or native-like states for 29 targets and has very similar capability to the allatom discrete optimized protein energy model (DOPE), found recently to outperform five currently used energy models.

Designing an accurate protein force field aimed at recognizing the native topology
from decoys and predicting the equilibrium structures from solely amino acid sequences has been the subject of extensive efforts for decades.1,2 The most expensive energy
models for protein structure prediction and folding work with all-atom molecular mechanics3–6 and knowledge-based force fields.7,8 All-atom Monte-Carlo (MC), en-
semble molecular dynamics (MD), and replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD)
simulations using both types of force fields have succeeded in folding a limited set of
small proteins with 40 residues. It is unclear at this time whether a wide range of topol-
ogies can be reached to an acceptable level of accuracy.
Given the increase in the number of genomic sequences and the plasticity of proteins
upon molecular association, it is desirable to reduce the number of degrees of freedom
used by the all-atom models and to increase the space of conformations that can be
explored using current computer resources. Reduced models offer the possibility to achieve both tasks9,10 and several coarse-grained protein models have been developed.11 The one-bead Ca model is currently used by the Gaussian network model to explore the conformational changes around the native state.12 Two-bead Ca-Sc models13,14 or three-bead Ca-Sc-Pep models, where Pep is an interaction center of the backbone, have been used for recognition,1 folding in water15 and lipid environments,16 binding,17 and assembly of membrane proteins.18 Ca-Sc1-Sc2 models with two beads for the side-chain,19–21 four-bead models consisting of N, Ca, C, and Sc atoms and six-bead models have been used for structure prediction and folding,22–24 protein-protein docking,21 and the study of aggregation mechanisms of amyloid-forming proteins.25–28
Finding a good compromise between energy accuracy, structural precision, number of degrees of freedom, and computational cost has been been widely investigated.11,29

Coarse-grained Protein Force Field

explicit orientation dependence in a coarse-grained, residue-level model improves the ability of pairwise potentials to recognize the native state.1 Similarly, the impact of multibody interactions ranging from 4-body33,34 to higher orders35 is still being examined.
This work revisits the coarse-grained OPEP energy function. Such a coarse graining, based on a six-bead model per amino acid, yields very high structural precision of the backbone and was found to discriminate native from ab initio-generated structures of peptides.23 Coupled to MC simulations, OPEP predicted the native structure of the 46-residue three helix-bundle from protein A,36 helical hairpins,37 and the 56-residue domain B1 of protein G,38 within 3.0 A˚ Ca root-mean square deviations (cRMSd) from experiments. OPEP was also used to study peptide folding and aggregation. Using the activation–relaxation technique (ART),39,40 folding pathways of a b-hairpin model were consistent with MD and MC methods,41 and aggregation of amyloid-forming peptides revealed reptation moves of the chains, in agreement with isotope-edited IR spectroscopy study.42
Despite these successes, there are two body of data indicating that the OPEP parameters are not optimal for proteins. Firstly, MC simulations suggested that a bab supersecondary motif with two parallel b-strands joined by a single a-helix could be a folding unit by itself,36 but this was not confirmed by CD and NMR experiments.43 Secondly, the side-chain parameters were not learned using realistic pair distance probability distributions; side-chain pairs including cysteine were not considered and all other pairs were poorly populated.23
Here, our goal is to test OPEP on a more significant number of proteins and to determine whether it can discriminate native or native-like from non-native conformations. This article is organized as follows. The OPEP force field and the protein chain are first reviewed with emphasis on the change with respect the original version. We then describe the optimization procedure used, and the training and validation sets which include 29 targets and 28,553 conformations. Finally, we analyze the recognition performances of OPEP and discuss the physical properties of the parameters.
METHODS
Reduced protein model
The coarse-grained off-lattice model we use has slightly evolved from the initial work.23 It still consists in a detailed representation of the backbone, modelled by its N, H, Ca, C0, O atoms (denoted as M for main chain) and in one bead or centroid for all side-chains (Sc), except the proline amino acid which is represented by all heavy atoms (Fig. 1).

Figure 1
OPEP coarse-grained representation. All amino acid side-chains but proline are represented by one centroid in OPEP force field. Their positions, defined with respect to the backbone heavy atoms (N, CA, C 0), and their van der Waals radii vary from one residue to another (see Table I).
However, in contrast to the initial model, where each centroid was defined by its bond length, virtual bond angle, and improper dihedral angle with respect to the Ca atoms, each side-chain is now defined with respect to its N, Ca, and C0 atoms (see Table I). The positions and Van der Waals radii were calculated using a dataset of 2,248 PDB structures44 sharing less than 30% sequence identity. The centroids were located at the mass center of the heavy atoms and calculated using the rotamer distribution of each side-chain. The Van der Waals radii were obtained by minimizing the sum over the 210 interactions of the squares of the difference between the mean inter centroid distance observed in the 2,248 PDB structures and the calculated value for each interaction type. Here, we have considered that two all-atom nonsequential side-chains are in contact if at least one distance is less than the sum of the van der Waals atomic radii þ1 A˚ . Overall, the values of the radii agree well with previously published sets,9 but such a procedure does not prevent the occurrence of severe collisions within our database of 2,248 structures (3.5% among all contacts).
OPEP energy function
The terms for modeling the short-range and longrange interactions in the OPEP function (version 3) are the same as in OPEP versions 1.023,36 and 2.0.37 In particular, OPEP includes cooperative 4-body hydrogen-

r0 is the Van der Waals radius (A˚ ). rCAÀSc is the distance between the Ca and the centroid of the side-chain (A˚ ). N :CcA:Sc and Sc:CcA:C0 (degrees) are the valence
angles involving respectively N, Ca, and the side-chain centroid, and the sidechain centroid, Ca and C0 atoms. Values are given for each residue-type. For simplicity, we also give the one-bead parameters for the proline side-chain, although
it is modelled by all heavy atoms in OPEP version 3.

operative nature of the amide H-bonds as demonstrated by quantum mechanical calculations,45 and takes into account the propensities of the residues for a and b states,
which are important in protein design or in predicting the aggregation rates of amyloid-forming proteins.46 The ana-
lytic forms of the hydrogen-bonding and backbone tor-
sional potentials have been modified since then to make
them derivable, and have been used in many studies of protein folding and aggregation.41,42,47,48 Only the pa-
rameters are therefore changed in the present exercise.

tion) version 3 is expressed as a sum of local, nonbonded

The force constants and equilibrium values associated with the main chain atoms are taken from AMBER,49 the force constants associated with the side-chains are very similar to those in AMBER. The E/ and Ew potentials attempt to generate Ramachandran plot of reduced protein structures in agreement with all-atom protein structures, and are expressed by the following quadratic polynomials:

where /0 ¼ / within the interval [/lower,/upper] and /0 ¼ min(/ À /lower, / À /upper), otherwise, with /lower ¼ À1608, and /upper ¼ À608, respectively. Similarly, we use wlower ¼ À608 and wupper ¼ 1608 in Eq. (4). We empha-
size that these terms do not prevent sampling of confor-
mations covering all values of / and w.

The radius is given in Table I for the side-chains and is set to the following values for backbone atoms: rN0 ¼ 1.75 A˚ , rH0 ¼ 1.00 A˚ , rC0a ¼ 2.385 A˚ , rC00 ¼ 1.85 A˚ , and rO0 ¼ 1.60 A˚ .

cut-off distance).
In this work, H(x) is set to 1 and a 12-6 potential is
used for all interactions, except between two side-chains.
For the side-chains, H(x) is set to 1 if the interaction is
hydrophobic in character or results from oppositely charged residues; otherwise H(x) ¼ 0 and the repulsive

À6 potential is used. The initial eij’s between (M0, M0), (M, Sc), (M0, Ca) and (Ca, Sc) particles are set to 0.005 kcal/mol, and those between (Ca, Ca) to 0.4 kcal/mol. The initial eij’s between (Sc, Sc) are taken from the work of Betancourt and Thirumalai,50 which refined the con-
tact matrix first proposed by Skolnick et al. based on a total of 224 non homologous proteins.51 Among a total
of 210 interactions, 93 pairs are thus governed by the re-
pulsive À6 potential.

The hydrogen-bonding potential (EH-bond) consists of two-body (EHB1) and four-body (EHB2) terms.28 Twobody H-bonds are defined by:

Here Eacoop and Ebcoop are cooperative energies, independent of the amino acids involved and EbR and EaR are the propensity potentials of residue R for b-sheet and a-helix as defined in OPEP version 1.0.23,36 The sum is over 4
residues for the first H-bond within a helix and over 1
residue for each additional H-bond, and the sum is gen-
erally over 2 residues associated with a H-bond in a
sheet. Note that we verified that the propensity of any
given residue is counted once within a long helix or b-sheet.
Overall, the interaction potential OPEP is expressed as
a function of 261 w weights: 213 for Enonbonded with 210 for ESc,Sc; 4 for Elocal, 4 for EH-bond and 40 for the propensities of the residues to be in a or b. This number of
parameters to be optimized is much larger than in OPEP
version 2 (47 parameters). In what follows, two sets will be discussed: version 3.1 with the parameters EbR and EaR included and version 3.2 with the same parameters set
to zero.

The sum is over all residues i and j separated by j ¼ iþ4
and j > iþ4 (helices 310 are thus excluded), rij is the O..H distance between the carbonyl oxygen and amide hydrogen, aij the NHO angle and r, set to 1.8 A˚ , the equilibrium value of the O..H distance. The initial parameters for ehb1-4 and ehb1>4 are set to 1.0 kcal/mol. Note that we distinguish short-range (ehb1À4) from long-range (ehb1>4) H-bond energies because the equilibrium Ca..Ca distances vary between a-helices (6.1 A˚ between 1–4 interactions) and b-sheets (4.5 A˚ ).

Force field optimization
In protein structure prediction, an ideal force field must discriminate native from non-native structures for all natural sequences. This can be done by optimizing the ratio Tf/Tg, where Tf and Tg are the folding and glass transition temperatures, or maximizing the z-score between native and non-native structures.22 Because the native basin consists of an ensemble of native-like conformations in equilibrium, it is desirable to learn also from these near-native structures.52 Here, we follow the work of Qiu and Elber31 and require that, for all protein targets, the native structure (N) is of lowest energy, and the native-like (NL) structures are simultaneously of higher energy than the native structure and of lower energy than the remote decoys (D). This double condition can be translated into a set of inequalities :
EðSn; DiÞ À EðSn; N Þ > 0; for all i and n ð13Þ

The parameter D(ijkl) is set to 1 if residues (k, l) ¼ (iþ1, jþ1) and (j ¼ iþ4, l ¼ kþ4), otherwise D(ijkl) ¼ 0. Thus helices P are not stabilized. The parameter D0(ijkl) ¼ 1 if k and l satisfy either conditions: (k, l) ¼ (iþ2, jÀ2) or (iþ2, jþ2); otherwise D0(ijkl) ¼ 0. Together, these conditions help stabilize a-helices, anti-
parallel, and parallel b-sheets, independently of the (/,w)

Di is the ith decoy conformation, and NLj is the jth native-like conformation. Thus, for each protein, the scoring function (SF) is set to À1 for each satisfied inequality, otherwise 0.
To solve Eqs. (13–15) for all training proteins, the 261 weights are optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) under two constraints. Firstly, the value of the Heavyside function is kept fixed for all van der Waals interaction types. This means that a given interaction type cannot varied from a 12À6 to À6 potential during optimization, and vice versa. Secondly, the magnitude of the Sc-Sc parameters are allowed to vary within specific ranges (see Validation Set). Here, GA uses standard mutation and single cross-over operators, with a mutation rate of 20% decreasing by 0.25% every 10 iterations and a cross-over rate of 14%. Double cross-over operators were tested, but identical results were obtained. We use a population size of 80 chromosomes and the elitism condition (13%) for selection. All these parameters are learnt from sensitivity analysis. Convergence in a single GA run is considered to be reached when the total number of inequalities solved does not change during 100 iterations, and the simulation is repeated 100 times using different random seeds. To guarantee that GA does not stop in a local minimum, we also perform 50 MC simulated annealing simulations of 50,000 steps starting from the best GA-determined parameters by varying one weight at each step. No improvement is observed.
Training set
The training set (TS) consists of the following 11 PDB entries: 1ABZ, 1DV0, 1E0M, 1ORC, 1PGB, 1QHK, 1SHG, 1SS1, 1VII, 2CI2, and 2CRO, and Betanova.53 The last target 1PGBF spans the residues 41–56 of 1PGB. These proteins were selected by following three criteria. They are stable in solution without additional support, such as disulfide bonds and nonnatural amino acids. They cover a spectrum of structural classes (a, b, mixed a/b), and have medium chain lengths (16–65 amino acids) so as to facilitate conformation sampling.
The quality of the decoys employed is very important.30–32 The decoys must cover the widest conformational space, be of lowest energy so as to compete with the native structures, be generated by various protocols so as to limit the influence of the algorithm used. In this work, we have combined four protocols to generate native-like and non-native structures for the training set.
i. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the all-atom GROMOS force field and the GROMOS package.54 Starting from the experimental structures, explicit solvent MD is carried out for 1 ns at 600 K. All generated structures are clustered using a cRMSd cutoff of 2.5 A˚ . On average, 100 structures deviating by 1–12 A˚ from experiment are considered for each training protein.

ii. We use the simple gapless threading method, that is no gap is allowed within the template structures. The templates include the PDB entries 1PGB, 1SHG, 2CI2, 1CSP, 5FD1, 2ACY, 1CTF, 1UBQ, and 3CHY. The list is kept small because gapless threading performs poorly in fold recognition experiments, but the generated local mimina are interesting because they have native structure characteristics. On average, 200 decoys are generated for each training protein.
iii. We use the recently-designed greedy algorithm using a Go-based energy function and a cRMSd-based energy function.55 Such a procedure provides us with both low-energy and high-energy conformations deviating by 0.05 to over 20 A˚ cRMSd from the experimental structures.
iv. We use the Decoys ‘‘R’’ Us publicly available fisa set for protein 2CRO, hereafter referred to as 2CRO-fisa, generated by assembling protein fragments using a simulated annealing procedure.56
Another important aspect in our optimization process is to assign each conformation with native-like or nonnative characters. It is common in the study of protein folding to use the cRMSd or the fraction of native contacts. Network and graph analyses of free energy surfaces have clearly shown the limitation of these parameters.57 Here, we use the TM-align program, a fast and accurate protein structure alignment algorithm,58,59 and the default TM-score of 0.5 for discriminating native-like (TM-score > 0.5) from nonnative structures (<0.5). To this end, all decoys were optimally aligned with their corresponding native structure, and we selected five structures with TM-scores varying between 0.5 and 1.0 as native-like conformations. For 1SHG, the narrow distribution of TM-scores led us to select only four native-like structures. In what follows, the nonredundant training set of each target consists in the native structure, five (or four) native-like structures and the decoys with TMscores <0.5, while the full training set includes all decoys, independently of the TM-scores.
Table II analyzes the structural characteristics of the full-training set in terms of cRMSd’s and TM-scores with respect to the native state, and the percentage of residues in a and b states. Note that the extremes values of the parameters do not change between the nonredundant and the full training sets, and all structures were optimized using OPEP until the gradient norm <0.01 kcal/ (mol A˚ ). Overall the resulting density of states shows that the conformational space sampled is not limited to any specific basin of attraction.
Validation set
To test the effectiveness of OPEP, we have considered multiple decoy sets, namely 4-state reduced,62,63 lmds

aM is the oligomeric state according to E-MSD (the European Bioinformatics Institute Macromolecular Structure Database60), L is the protein length (amino acids), TOT is the total number of decoys used per protein, generated either by molecular dynamics (MD), threading (TH) and greedy (GR) methods or taken from publicly available sets. This is followed by the maximal (max) and minimal (min) cRMSd’s and TM-scores between the decoys and the native structure, as well as the average percentages of a-helix and b-strand conformations identified using the Stride program.61 l: decoys generated by ART-OPEP simulations as described in the text.

and lmdsv2,63 semfold,64 fisa,56 lattice-ssfit,65 Rosetta,66 and CASP6.67 Clearly, we cannot minimize $120 targets and a total of $210,000 conformations with a gradient norm of 0.01 kcal/(mol A˚ ) using reasonable computer resources. In addition, some targets are in our training list (2CRO-fisa), are multi-domains (e.g., 1FC2), involve ligands such as calcium (e.g., 4ICB and 1E68) or iron (4RXN), are stabilized by disulfide bridges (2 among 7 proteins in 4-state reduced set, this requires to parametrize oxided Cys), or lack terminal residues in Rosetta.
In this work, we consider the following targets: lmds (1BBA, 1CTF, 2CRO), lmdsv2 (1UBI), 4-state reduced (1CTF, 1R69, 2CRO), lattice-ssfit (1CTF), semfold (1CTF, 1KHM), Rosetta (1R69), and CASP6 (1S04, 1TE7). For 1CTF semfold, 1CTF lattice-ssfit and 1KHM semfold, we did not consider the full set of 11399, 2000, and 21,079 decoys, respectively but randomly choose $1,000 decoys covering the full TM-Score and Ca cRMSd distributions. Note also that 1CTF is the single target selected which is stabilized by a SO42À ligand, and 1R69 has 63 amino

acids in the experimental structure and the 4-state set, but 61 amino acids in the Rosetta set (the two C-terminal residues are missing). Finally, decoys were generated for 1FSD, 1R69, and 1CTF using the MD approach (see above), and decoys were also obtained for 1F4I using ART-OPEP39,40 simulations. The ART-OPEP simulations started from fully extended conformations and were carried out for 20,000 steps using the parameters prior to optimization. This set of 10 distinct proteins (16 targets), consisting of 20,926 decoys, constitutes the full-validation set (VS). As for TS, we generate a nonredundant validation set. The structural properties of the full VS set are described in Table II. We see that the cRMSd’s deviate by 0.1–36.9 A˚ and the TM-scores vary between 0.12 and 0.99.
Table III shows the total number of side-chain sidechain contacts and the fraction of each amino acid type in secondary structures for the VS plus TS sets. Although we use a total number of 22 proteins and 28,553 decoys, some Sc-Sc pairs are poorly populated in TS or VS.

DTOT is the total number of decoys. NL is the number of native-like structures used during the optimization process. SFmax is the maximal value of the scoring function, SF, for each target. SFstart and SFend are the SF values before and after optimization. Gain is the SF gain after optimization (¼ SFstart À SFend), and Unsat is the number of inequalities remaining unsatisfied after optimization (¼ SFend À SFmax).

Among a total of 210 pairs, the number of contacts is less than 50 for 10 pairs. The low population for the Cys-Cys pair is expected since we do not consider proteins stabilized by disulfide bridges. The low population for the Cys-Ser, His-Phe, His-Gly, His-Met, His-Gln, HisSer, and His-Val pairs is observed in TS, but not in VS. Conversely, the weak occurrence of the His-His pair is observed in VS only. This clearly indicates that our choice of targets is not free of any biases. In contrast, the Cys-His contact is rarely seen in both TS and VS, and in our 2248 PDB structures, indicating its weak occurrence in protein structures. To take account of the previous biases in our distribution of Sc-Sc contacts, the optimization of the matrix contact proposed by Betancourt and Thirumalai50 is under control and the wSc,Sc weights are restrained to vary between 0.7 and 1.3.

RESULTS
Overall performance of recognition
Table IV presents the results of the optimization of OPEP version 3.1 on the nonredundant training set. A total scoring function, SF, of À29,457 indicates that all inequalities in Eqs. (13–15) are satisfied, and thus all native structures are of lowest energy, and all selected native-like structures are of lower energy than the remote conformations. We find that SF decreases from À26,872 to À28,101 during the optimization. Although the improvement is not optimal, 48% of inequalities initially unsatisfied are satisfied. Refined OPEP improves recognition for 11 proteins (SF decrease of 1 for 1PGB and 321 for 1SS1) and appears less efficient for Betanova and 2CRO-fisa (SF increase of 9 and 52, respectively). The

optimized Sc-Sc, H-bond, and a-helix and b-sheet propensities are given in Table 1S provided in Supplementary Materials.
We now consider the full-training and full-validation sets in Table V. Figure 1S provided in Supplementary Materials plots the energy versus TM-score for all proteins after optimization and the energy versus cRMSd for Betanova. 3,179,377 inequalities are to be satisfied. Prior to optimization 2,439,934 inequalities are satisfied (739,443 unsatisfied), and, after optimization, 2,748,877 inequalities are satisfied (430,500 unsatisfied). Thus, on the order of 42% of the unsatisfied inequalities have been solved. We also show in Table V the rank of the experimental structure and whether the lowest-energy structure is associated with a native-like or a non-native structure. The experimental structure is ranked first for four training proteins (1DV0, 1QHK, 1SS1, and 2CI2) and four validating targets (1CTF-4state, 1CTF-lattice, 1KHMsemfold and 1R69-4state). A native-like structure is

ranked first for five other TS proteins, and for 10 VS targets. Overall, OPEP version 3.1 is able to discriminate native or native-like structures from nonnative conformations for 23 of the 29 targets, that is 69% (9/13) of the TS targets and 87.5% (14/16) of the VS targets.
Problematic targets
It is of interest to examine the six problematic targets at the atomic level of detail. These include the four TS 1ABZ, Betanova, 1E0M, and 2CRO-fisa targets, and the VS 1CTF-lmds and 1S04-CASP6 targets. Figure 2 shows their experimental and lowest-energy structures.
For the 1ABZ and 1E0M training proteins, the minimal energy is associated with a near-native conformation. The lowest-energy conformation for 1ABZ has a TMScore of 0.49 (see Figure 1S in Supplementary Materials), but deviates by 2.3 A˚ cRMSd from the NMR structure [Fig. 2(A)]. Similarly, the decoy of lowest-energy for the 34-residue 1E0M protein has a TM-score of 0.43 and deviates by 6.8 A˚ cRMSd from the NMR structure. However, its topology is native: excluding the extremities, where structural determination is very low by NMR,70 the cRMSd using residues 6–31 is only 2.2 A˚ [Fig. 2(C)]. The energy gain in the decoy comes essentially from the extension of the third b-strand by 2 residues.
For the 65-residue 2CRO-fisa set, the energy gap between the lowest-energy decoy and native-like structures is marginal, on the order of kBT. The best decoy (TM-score of 0.45) deviates by 6.0 A˚ cRMSd from the crystal structure [Fig. 2(D,E)]. The best native-like conformation (TM-score of 0.58) deviates by 4.2 and 2.7 A˚ cRMSd from the crystal structure using residues 1–65 and residues 3–61, respectively. While the crystal and native-like conformations are described by a five-helix bundle, the decoy is a four-helix bundle with the fifth helix unfolded and the first three helices deviating by 4.3 A˚ from their positions in the crystal structure [see Fig. 2(D,E)]. One must note, however, that 2CRO is one target which displays intermolecular interactions within the unit cell of the crystal structure (homotrimeric assembly, as described in the Macromolecular Structure Database60).
While Betanova is expected to adopt a three-stranded b-sheet in solution,53 the minimal energy structure is a b-hairpin [Fig. 2(B)]. This decoy results from threading the sequence on the residues 1–20 of 1PGB. The hairpin is stabilized by 5 kcal/mol with respect to the NMR structure because the increase in two-body and fourbody H-bond contributions outperforms the loss of side-chain–side-chain interactions. This preference for the b-hairpin is surprising, but there is a large body of experimental and theoretical studies indicating that the three-stranded b-sheet is not the dominant conformation in solution. In contrast to the first experimental study, the NMR b-sheet population has been reestimated

to be $10% in water at 283 K.71 All-atom MD simulations in explicit solvent showed that the ideal threestranded b-sheet structure is in dynamic equilibrium with other disordered species within a 100-ns timescale.72 Interestingly, for another peptide, namely the protein 1PGB C-terminal fragment, transition graph analysis of folding free energy surfaces suggests that the b-hairpin is slightly more populated than a triple stranded b-sheet,57 and thus points to our two competiting conformations.
The lowest-energy lmds decoy of the 68-residue 1CTF protein has a TM-score of 0.42 and displays a nonnative topology. This decoy is stabilized by 3 and 5 kcal/mol with respect to the best near-native and native structures. The decoy and native structures differ by 8.7 A˚ cRMSd. As discussed earlier, the crystal structure has a SO42À ligand hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain nitrogen of Lys65 and the amide nitrogen of Gly62 (in PDB numbering). It has been suggested that this sulfate environment may have functional implications.73 In fact, there is no space for a SO42À ligand in proximity of Lys65 and Gly62 in the decoy structure [see Fig. 2(F)].
Finally, the best decoy of 1S04 differs from the native and best native-like structures by 23 and 6 kcal/mol, respectively. As shown in Figure 2(G), the decoy, of nonnative topology, is characterized by a swap of the bstrands 2 and 3 and a destabilization of the a-helices (24% of helical residues vs. 39% in the native structure). In addition, the b-sheet is less twisted and the strands are extended (29% of b-strands vs. 25% in the native state). As seen in Figure 2(H,I), the topological change is stabilized by both the H-bonds and a more compact hydrophobic core.
In summary, we can consider that OPEP correctly recognizes 1ABZ (based on the cRMSd criterion), the calculation in solution might not be appropriate for 1CTF and 2CRO, and OPEP clearly fails for 1S04. This suggests that the balance between hydrogen-bonding and Sc-Sc interactions could be reevaluated, but before doing so, four questions must be addressed.
OPEP parameters are robust
The first question is whether a larger training set would impact the results.30 To this end, we repeat the optimization process by training the parameters on the nonredundant TS and VS sets, starting from our previous optimal weights. The optimization, achieved after 100 GA runs, leads to a negligible gain of 0.05% of satisfied inequalities. Applied to the full TS and VS sets, the gain amounts to 2.2%. However, the correlation coefficient betwen the two OPEP vectors is 0.98, and the recognition performances remain identical. For instance, the rank of the native structure for the problematic targets is 28 versus 30 for 1ABZ, 33 versus 34 for 1E0M, 31 versus 32 for 1S04-CASP6, and 116 versus 115 for

2CRO-fisa. This indicates that the OPEP parameters are robust and insensitive to the number of proteins used in the derivation.
Success rate: OPEP versus published force fields
It is also important to assess how OPEP compares to other published force fields in ranking native structures. This is not an easy task, since all studies differ in the list of targets, criteria and decoys used. However, Shen and Sali recently tested the atomic distance-dependent statistical DOPE potential74,75 and compared its recognition performance with respect to five other scoring functions, namely Rosetta,56,76,77 DFIRE,78 and ModPipe.79 DOPE correctly identified 28 native structures for 32 targets, versus 27 for DFIRE, 14 for Rosetta, and 19, 7 and 18 for the three ModPipe versions.
In this work, we have calculated the all-atom DOPE energies of our full list of decoys using the SCWRL3 program80 to rebuild the all-atom side chains and the ‘‘Decoys’’ tool of the Protein Library available at http:// protlib.uchicago.edu/.74 Because such a side-chain reconstruction can affect DOPE performances with respect to the published results using the non-minimized decoys, we also report the DOPE results on the non-minimized sets. We emphasize that our goal is not to rank OPEP versus DOPE, because our analysis is not based on all the decoys used for evaluating DOPE. In addition, DOPE is less accurate on small proteins (less than 50 amino acids) and NMR-derived structures.75
Table VI compares OPEP and DOPE performances on each target using four criteria: the z-score calculated as the distance in standard deviations from the energy of the native structure EN to the average energy of the decoys (z-score ¼ (EN À hEDi)/rED), the correlation coefficients between the energies and the cRMSd’s or the TM-scores, and the rank of the native or native like structures. Figure 2S provided in Supplementary Materials plots the energy versus TM-score and energy versus cRMSd for all targets using OPEP and DOPE.
Using the minimized decoys, OPEP correctly identifies 23 native or native-like structures for 29 targets, while DOPE is successful for 19 targets. Both OPEP and DOPE energy functions display negative z-score values except for the 1BBA-lmds target using OPEP - but most decoys are in fact native like with cRMSd’s of 2.2A˚ (see Supplementary Materials Figure 2S)-, and for the Betanova, 1BBA-lmds and 1FSD targets using DOPE. Overall, the mean z-score is slightly lower with OPEP (À2.07 versus À1.42 using DOPE), and the average z-score standard deviations are very similar (1.03 vs 1.11 using DOPE). Interestingly, the mean z-score values are very similar for OPEP on VS and TS. The correlations between the energies and TM-scores and between the energies and cRMSd’s are almost identical. Using both TS and VS sets,

For each target of the full-training and full-validation sets, we report the z-score and the correlation coefficient, R, between the energies and TM-scores using OPEP 3.1 or DOPE.74 The mean and standard deviation values are given for the training set, the validation set and both sets. Nrk is the rank of the native structure, NLrk is the rank of the lowest energy native-like structure. Rc reports the DOPE recognition status, ‘‘Yes’’ indicating that the lowest-energy structure is associated with the native or a near-native structure.

the mean correlation coefficients are À0.574 versus À0.557 for E versus TM-scores and 0.543 versus 0.557 for E versus cRMSd’s using OPEP and DOPE, respectively.
Using the publicly available 14 targets from Decoys ‘R’ Us, Rosetta and CASP6, that is without any minimisation and side-chain positioning, DOPE correctly identifies 10 targets, but fails for 1BBA-lmds, 1KHM-semfold, 1S04CASP6, and 1TE7-CASP6, whereas it failed for 5 targets among 14 using the minimised structures. The average zscore is of À2.95, with extreme values of 15 for 1BBAlmds and À10.1 for 1CTF-lattice. The corresponding val-

ues on the minimized structures are of À1.77, 0.62, and À4.75. On the same minimized targets, OPEP fails for 2CRO-fisa, 1CTF-lmds and 1S04-CASP6, that is correctly identifies 11 among 14 targets, and the average z-score value is À2.05. Plots of energy versus cRMSd are given in Figure 3S provided in Supplementary materials.

Impact of a-helix and b-sheet propensities on recognition
So far, we have examined the recognition performances of OPEP version 3.1. What is the impact of the a-helix and b-sheet propensity potentials set to zero? To this end, we repeat the optimization process on the nonredundant VS and analyse the results on the full TSþ VS. We find that the number of inequalities satisfied after optimisation does not vary much from version 3.1 to version 3.2: 2,583,679 inequalities are now satisfied versus 2,748,877 in version 3.1. However, Table VII shows that the identity of the minimal energy structure remains identical for all targets, and the rank of the native structures vary substantially only for 1F4I (ranked 125 by version 3.2 vs. 6 by version 3.1). Overall, we see that version 3.1 and version 3.2 cannot be distinguished on the basis

of the energy gap between native or native-like structures and non-native structures.
Is OPEP accurate for thermodynamics and kinetics?
Although discriminating native from misfolded conformations is an important aspect in protein folding, that does not imply OPEP provides an accurate description of the dynamics around and outside of the native state.
In the vicinity of minima, the thermal atomic fluctuations are well described. This is supported by MD simulations using OPEP version 3 on three protein models which showed root mean square fluctuations comparable to those found by all-atom molecular mechanics force fields.81 Outside of the minima, OPEP must generate energy barriers and transition states consistent with highlevel quantum mechanics calculations and molecular mechanics. A detailed study of the folding of a 16-residue b-hairpin using ART-OPEP version 2 simulations identified two pathways following closely those observed by previous theoretical studies.41 Additionally, MD-OPEP version 3 simulations revealed aggregation mechanisms for four chains of the amyloid-forming fragment Ab(16– 22) consistent with experiments.81
Similarly the present exercise does not guarantee that OPEP is accurate for thermodynamics. However, the results of four recent studies using OPEP version 3 are very encouraging. (i) MC simulations of the fragment Ab(21–30) in solution provide a very good fit with NMR experiments.82 (ii) MD simulations at 300 K show that a three-helix bundle and the B1 domain of protein G are stable within 50 ns timescale at room temperature.81 (iii) REMD-OPEP simulations find that the melting temperature of the b-hairpin 1PGBF peptide is consistent with experiment (295 K calculated vs. 297 K experimentally) (unpublished results). (iv) Using eight replicas with T varying between 287 and 500 K, the REMD-OPEP derived free energy surface of the Ab16–22 dimer at 310 K is very similar to that generated by all-atom explicit solvent REMD simulations.83
CONCLUSION
We have revisited the OPEP energy function on 29 targets using a total of 28,553 decoys. These decoys are generated by various protocols or taken from publicly available sets so as to limit the impact of the method used. The OPEP parameters are varied by genetic and MC algorithms using a scoring function which requires that both native and native-like conformations are of lower energies than decoys.
Overall, OPEP correctly identifies 24 native or nearnative conformations for 29 targets. This result is significant because the all-atom DOPE energy function, which was found to outperform five established force fields, is

found to have comparable capabilities on our set of decoys. In fact, OPEP fails to recognize the native basin for five targets: 1E0M, 2CRO-fisa, 1CTF-lmds, Betanova, and 1S04-CASP6. However, the structure of 1CTF has been solved with a tightly bound sulfate ion and the structure of 2CRO displays crystal packing effects. This suggests that the ion and the contacts between subunits may be required in our potential to identify their native structures.84 In contrast, there is no common features shared by 1E0M, Betanova, and 1S04, and two solutions can be proposed.
A more complex energy function may be required. Possible areas for improvement include higher-order /-w angle pairs terms,85 and many-body interactions between the side-chains.86
Alternatively, it is possible that all force fields will fail to discriminate native from nonnative states, because the experimental structure is not associated with the minimal effective energy, but with the global minimum of effective energy and conformational entropy.57
