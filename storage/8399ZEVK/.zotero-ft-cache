ABSTRACT An all-atom local contact model is described that can be used to predict protein motions underlying isotropic crystallographic B-factors. It uses a mean-ﬁeld approximation to represent the motion of an atom in a harmonic potential generated by the surrounding atoms resting at their equilibrium positions. Based on a 400-ns molecular dynamics simulation of ubiquitin in explicit water, it is found that each surrounding atom stiffens the spring constant by a term that on average scales exponentially with the interatomic distance. This model combines features of the local density model by Halle and the local contact model by Zhang and Bru¨ schweiler. When applied to a nonredundant set of 98 ultra-high resolution protein structures, an average correlation coefﬁcient of 0.75 is obtained for all atoms. The systematic inclusion of crystal contact contributions and fraying effects is found to enhance the performance substantially. Because the computational cost of the local contact model scales linearly with the number of protein atoms, it is applicable to proteins of any size for the prediction of B-factors of both backbone and side-chain atoms. The model performs as well as or better than several other models tested, such as rigid-body motional models, the local density model, and various forms of the elastic network model. It is concluded that at the currently achievable level of accuracy, collective intramolecular motions are not essential for the interpretation of B-factors.

INTRODUCTION
Advances in x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have allowed the determination of a large number of protein structures, as is reﬂected in the rapid growth of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (1). Although most proteins adopt a highly speciﬁc average three-dimensional structure, they also exhibit signiﬁcant amounts of ﬂuctuations that play an important role in protein function. For the protein backbone, for example, heteronuclear NMR relaxation spectroscopy yields time-resolved dynamic information about reorientational motions of bonds, such as the backbone amide N-H bonds (2,3). Amino acid side-chain dynamic information from NMR, on the other hand, is much more sparse, with the exception of methyl-bearing side chains (4).
X-ray crystallography provides information about protein mobility through Debye-Waller temperature factors, or B-factors, for both backbone and side-chain atoms (5). The B-factor is a measure of the uncertainty of the atomic position, which includes the effects of noise due to model errors and lattice defects, in addition to the positional variance of thermal protein motion. The amount of noise is generally lowest for the highest-resolution structures (<1 A˚ ).
There is signiﬁcant interest in reproducing experimental protein dynamics data by computational methods to assess the quality of the latter. Among computational methods, molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations provide the most comprehensive view of protein motions (6). Exper-

imental dynamics parameters serve as useful benchmarks for the assessment of molecular mechanics force ﬁelds, sampling of conformational space, and computational protocols (7). The sampling issue can be bypassed, at the cost of accuracy, by using normal-mode analysis where the force ﬁeld in the vicinity of the native state is replaced by its multivariate quadratic expansion. This allows the compact representation of protein dynamics by the superposition of motional ﬂuctuations along normal modes with individual amplitudes (8–13).
More recently, a new class of coarse-grained harmonic models known as elastic network models (ENM) (14) has been developed that includes Gaussian network models (GNM) (15), anisotropic network models (16–18), and a combination of the two (19). In these models, the interactions between amino acids that lie within a given cutoff distance, rc, are modeled as Hookean springs. The resulting eigenmodes yield a description of the protein ﬂuctuations in terms of collective motions. These models have been tested against experimental protein B-factors as benchmarks, typically yielding at least qualitative agreement with experiment. ENM also provides directional information about internal motions (20,21). An ENM-based model that achieves the best B-factor prediction so far is the chemical network model (CNM) (22), which employs the closest distance between two residues, rather than their Ca-Ca distance, as well as different spring constants between bonded and nonbonded residue pairs. For a set of 98 highresolution protein structures, an average Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between predicted and experimental B-factors of 0.75 was obtained. Reorientational generalizations of ENM,

which are the reorientational contact-weighted ENM (23) and the network of coupled rotators (24), were successfully used for the reproduction of NMR spin-relaxation-derived N-H order parameters.
In all these models, calculation of motional amplitudes involves inversion of a Kirchhoff or Hessian matrix, which makes them computationally expensive when the number of residues is large. Due to their coarse-grained nature, the calculation of B-factors of atoms other than Ca atoms, including functionally important side-chain atoms, is not readily possible.
It has long been recognized that B-factors not only report on intramolecular motions but are also sensitive to the presence of rigid-body motions (25). A model termed translation, librations, and screw (TLS), proposed recently (26), uses 10 ﬁtting parameters for each protein and produces a relatively high average correlation coefﬁcient with respect to experimental B-factors (>0.8).
Halle (27) introduced a fundamentally different interpretation of crystallographic B-factors, the local density model (LDM), which relates the B-factors to local atom density. It assumes that each atom moves in a quadratic potential of mean force (PMF) generated by the neighboring atoms ﬁxed at their equilibrium positions. All neighboring atoms that lie within a cutoff distance of ~7.35 A˚ of a given atom contribute equally to the effective force constant of this atom. Thus, the atom with the largest neighbor-atom density will have the lowest B-factor.
NMR S2 order parameters (28) describe the reorientational restrictions of bond vector ﬂuctuations and thereby can be viewed as the reorientational counterpart to B-factors (29). It has been empirically demonstrated that backbone N-H 1-S2 values are closely related to a contact sum that consists of terms with an exponential distance dependence between the surrounding atoms and the amide proton itself and carbonyl oxygen of the preceding amino acid (30). S2 order parameters of side-chain methyl groups can be modeled similarly well by an extended local contact model (LCM) (23).
Here, we develop a model that combines features of the LDM and LCM for the prediction of B-factors for all atoms and analyzes a 400-ns MD trajectory of ubiquitin to test basic assumptions that go into this model. We then apply the model to a set of 98 crystal structures used previously (22) and compare the results with different models.
THEORY AND METHODS
PDB set
All B-factor prediction calculations were applied to a set of 98 highestresolution x-ray crystal structures previously used by Kondrashov et al. (22). This is a nonredundant set of protein structures that represents all major SCOP families. All of its members have at least 50 residues in a single chain with resolution %1 A˚ . For protein systems with more than one asymmetric unit, only the experimental B-factors from the ﬁrst unit were used. For the

back-calculation, the unit cell was surrounded by 26 nearest-neighbor cells to include crystal contact contributions between asymmetric units inside the unit cell and between different unit cells. The B-factors calculated in this way were then averaged over the asymmetric units for comparison with experiment. Only one side-chain conformation per amino acid was used. Local contacts between proteins and cofactors and ligands were included, whereas all contacts with water molecules were discarded.

MD trajectory

A 400-ns MD trajectory of ubiquitin in explicit SPC/E water at 300 K was
performed using the AMBER9 package (31) with the AMBER99SB force
ﬁeld (32), as described previously (33). A total of 400,000 snapshots at
a time increment of 1 ps are used to calculate a PMF(rij) between Ca atoms of amino acids 1 and 70 and all heavy atoms, where rij is the distance between the two atoms. An effective force constant between Ca atoms and all other heavy atoms was determined from the variance s2ij of rij, calculated over the trajectory according to

where kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the absolute temperature. Hence, this model for the prediction of B-factors contains the three global parameters r0, a, and b. As it turns out, b has only a modest effect on the results and can therefore be neglected, and a is an overall scaling factor, which does not affect the correlation coefﬁcients between calculated and experimental B-factors. This leaves the interaction distance r0 as the only essential parameter in this local contact model for the prediction of crystallographic B-factors (LCMB). It is sufﬁcient to calculate the force constant between atom pairs within a certain cutoff. We use a cutoff of 15 A˚ in this work, as the effect of cutoff turns out to be negligible as long as it is >10 A˚ . To speed up the computation of the pairwise atomic distances, a classical cell subdivision algorithm (34) is employed, which renders the computational cost proportional to the number of protein atoms.

End effects
In proteins for which the N- and C-termini of proteins are not part of an a-helix or b-strand structure, the termini often exhibit fraying effects, manifested in an increase of their B-factors. This effect is included here by multiplying the calculated B-factors of the ﬁrst and last residues by a factor of 1.5, the second and second-to-last by a factor of 1.4, and the third

A simpliﬁed version of the TLS model is obtained when translational and screw motions are removed and only isotropic rotation is allowed about the center of mass, which leads to the following distance dependence of the B-factors:

RESULTS

MD results

The 400-ns MD trajectory of ubiquitin was analyzed in terms

of the ﬂuctuation amplitudes (variances s2ij) of interatomic distances between Ca atoms and all heavy atoms, which

were converted into effective force constants fij according

to Eq. 1. Fig. 1 shows fij as a function of the average distance rij. The vertical bars represent averages over 2-A˚ intervals starting at 4 A˚ , and the solid line is the ﬁt to the vertical

bars using the exponential function

(in units of kg$sÀ2 or nN/nm, with rij expressed in A˚ ). Although individual force constants can considerably deviate from the average, especially for some of the smaller distances (<8 A˚ ), the average force constants approximate very well the relationship of Eq. 4 (Ca-Ca pairs with a distance <4 A˚ have force constants that are ~10 times larger than the average force constant found for the 4- to 6-A˚ interval and were not included in the ﬁt).
To test the quality of this approximation, we calculated the Ca B-factors from the above model using the force constants extracted from the MD simulation (Fig. 1, dots), as well as the force constant derived from the best exponential ﬁt (Eq. 12) and compared them with the B-factors directly calculated from MD simulations. The Pearson correlation coefﬁcients, R, are 0.55 and 0.66, respectively, with the main discrepancies found for residue 8 and both termini. The corresponding Spearman correlation coefﬁcients, which are more robust with respect to outliers, are 0.87 and 0.80, respectively. Hence, the MD simulation validates the basic assumptions underlying the LCMB (Eqs. 2–5). In the next section, the LCMB is tested against experimental B-factors.

eLCMB backbone Ca results
The eLCMB was next applied to the 98-protein set. When r0 is set to 1.9 A˚ , the average Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
between predicted and experimental Ca B-factors is 0.72. The correlation can be further improved by optimizing r0. For r0 ¼ 3 A˚ , an optimal average correlation coefﬁcient of R ¼ 0.74 Æ 0.1 is found. When r0 is optimized for each protein individually, its mean Æ SD is r0 ¼ 3 Æ 1.1 A˚ .

FIGURE 2 Effect of including crystal contacts on the LCMB model performance for a set of 98 ultra-high resolution protein structures. The Pearson correlation coefﬁcients between predictions and experiment are plotted along the x and y axes for Ca B-factors without and with, respectively, the inclusion of crystal contacts.

Also, inclusion of the offset of 0.3 in Eq. 12 has a minimal effect and therefore will be neglected. The B-factor correction of the N- and C-terminal Ca triples has a more noticeable effect: without this correction, the correlation is 0.72 for r0 ¼ 3 A˚ .
Crystal packing interactions make a signiﬁcant contribution to the calculated B-factors (35). Without the inclusion of crystal packing effects, the average correlation coefﬁcient is 0.64. A comparison of the performance of LCMB with and without crystal contact contributions for all 98 proteins is given in Fig. 2. It shows that for 81 of the 98 proteins, the prediction improves when crystal contacts are included. The kind of improvement of the B-factor prediction brought about by the inclusion of crystal contacts is exempliﬁed for the 56kDa cholesterol oxidase (PDB code 1N4W). Fig. 3, b and c, shows the predicted B-factors with and without crystal contacts, respectively, together with the experimental Bfactors. The correlation coefﬁcients are 0.84 (Fig. 3 b) and 0.72 (Fig. 3 c), respectively. The intermolecular interactions between two asymmetric units within the unit cell are displayed in Fig. 3 a. The protein fragment colored in yellow around residue 380 of the black unit makes extensive contacts with the orange part around residue 35 of the gray unit. These crystal contacts reduce the B-factors of the interacting regions, as indicated in Fig. 3, b and c. Other crystal contacts not shown in Fig. 3 a are presented in Fig. S1 in the Supporting Material.
Due to its simplicity, the LCMB is applicable not only to Ca atoms, but also to any other atom in the protein. When the

0.80, 0.75, and 0.77, respectively. The inclusion of crystal packing effects is critically important for all-atom B-factor predictions: when crystal packing effects are not taken into account, the average R drops to 0.65 for the protein set used here.
A number of modiﬁcations of the eLCMB were made to test whether its performance can be further improved. In particular, contributions from atoms within the same amino acid were treated separately, as were contributions from atoms of residues that precede or succeed in sequence the residue that contains the atom of interest. None of these modiﬁcations yielded any further increase in the average correlation coefﬁcient.

DISCUSSION
Crystallographic B-factors of high-resolution crystal structures provide a wealth of experimental information at atomic resolution about the motional disorder of proteins. This explains why B-factors are frequently used to test motional models of proteins.
A key issue is the distinction between overall motion and intramolecular dynamics. The most general rigid-body motional model is the TLS model (25), which interprets the B-factors by combining overall anisotropic rotational, translational, and screw motions. It was recently combined with a random-walk model for the three N- and C-terminal residues, and an overall correlation was found that was notably high (26). For the protein set used in this work, the average correlation coefﬁcient is 0.8. It must be kept in mind, however, that this model uses 10 ﬁtting parameters compared to one actual ﬁtting parameter (namely the overall scaling factor) for the LCMB. Although 10 is well below the number of Ca atoms of the proteins considered, residues with increased B-factors tend to cluster into groups of consecutive residues. These clusters are relatively localized in space, and they typically do not vastly outnumber the ﬁtting parameters of the TLS model. To test the possibility of overﬁtting in the TLS model, a plane with random orientation was laid for each protein through the protein’s center of mass, and the TLS model was ﬁtted only to the atoms on one side of the plane. The ﬁtting parameters were then used to predict the B-factors of the other protein half. The procedure was applied for 360 randomly chosen planes for each protein. An average correlation coefﬁcient of 0.5 is obtained for the back-calculated B-factors. This strongly suggests that the TLS model is, to a signiﬁcant degree, susceptible to overﬁtting.
A simpliﬁed version of the TLS model with a single ﬁtting parameter is the rotation-only model (ROM) (Eq. 11), which allows isotropic rotation about the protein’s center of mass only (i.e., no translational and screw motion). For the protein set used here, the ROM produces an average correlation coefﬁcient of 0.56. In ROM, the predicted B-factors increase quadratically with the distance of the residue from the protein center (Eq. 11). ROM captures some of this trend,

FIGURE 5 Comparison of correlation coefﬁcients obtained from the CNM and eLCMB models for a 98-protein set. The two models have very similar overall performance, but distinct performance for individual proteins.
presumably because protein regions that exhibit increased experimental B-factors are often close to the protein surface. On the other hand, the TLS and ROM models explain neither the effect of local crystal packing on B-factors nor the sometimes sizeable differences between B-factors of atoms belonging to the same residue. This suggests that intramolecular disorder and dynamics are the dominant contributors to the B-factors for most systems. This conclusion is consistent with a MD study of staphylococcal nuclease in a crystalline environment, which found that ~70% of the B-factor contributions are due to internal motion (36).
In the original LDM work (27), an improved agreement with experiment was found when crystal contacts were included. When applied to a set of 972 proteins, an average correlation coefﬁcient of 0.51 was reported for the LDM, and this improves to 0.61 when 1/r-distance weighting is used (37). When the LDM is applied to the 98-protein set used in this work, the average correlation coefﬁcient is 0.62 without and 0.68 with the inclusion of crystal contacts.
The LCMB introduced here combines features of LDM with the contact model (30). The latter was developed for the prediction of NMR order parameters and it also uses a contact sum with terms that follow the exponential-distance weighting of Eq. 4. The LDM and LCMB both represent mean-ﬁeld approaches of protein dynamics, since they predict motions on a site-by-site basis with the other protein atoms ﬁxed at their average positions. Therefore, these models neither invoke nor predict collective motions among protein atoms. The inclusion of fraying effects at the protein termini in the eLCMB model is an exception.

By contrast, elastic network models naturally provide

a collective description of protein dynamics in terms of

a superposition of motion along orthogonal normal modes.

The B-factor prediction by the GNM produces, for the

present protein set, a correlation of R ¼ 0.59. The inclusion

of crystal packing effects positively affects the GNM perfor-

mance. For example, when crystal packing effects are

combined with the chemical network model (22), R ¼ 0.75

is obtained. Fig. 5 compares the CNM correlation coefﬁ-

cients (22) with the corresponding correlation coefﬁcients

of the eLCMB. The two models have virtually identical

overall performance, although the performance can differ

signiﬁcantly for individual proteins.

In the mean-ﬁeld approximation underlying the LCMB,

the distance dependence of the pairwise atomic interaction

strength is derived from an all-atom MD simulation. We

calculated the corresponding PMFs of the Ca atoms from the GNM model of ubiquitin with a 7.5-A˚ cutoff. For this

purpose, we generated a canonical ensemble with 100,000

snapshots according to the quadratic energy function deﬁned

by the GNM model (Eq. 6) and calculated the pairwise

distance-dependent force constant in analogy to the treat-

ment of the MD trajectory (see Fig. S2), which yields

a distance dependence for the force constants of

f ij rij ¼ 7:3 Â exp À rij=9:7 þ 2:1 (13)

(in units of kg$sÀ2 or nN/nm, with rij expressed in A˚ ). As is the case with the MD-derived relationship (Eq. 12), Eq. 13 shows an exponential distance dependence. It differs from the MD-derived relationship, however, in terms of both the size of the offset, which is quite large, and the decay constant in the exponent, which favors contributions from atoms that are farther away. It is important to note that the GNM underestimates the force constant between sequential Ca atoms by ~10-fold. This explains the better performance of the CNM, which employs a 10-fold-increased force constant between neighboring residues and thereby substantially improves the correlation with experiment (22).
Besides the correlation coefﬁcient, the variability of the overall scaling factors of the predicted versus experimental B-factors is another measure of the quality of the model. For a given protein, the overall scaling factoPr, s, is obtained by minimizing the mean-square difference i (s Â Bpre,i À Bexp,i)2, where the sum is over all Ca atoms. One might expect that for a given dynamics model the overall scaling factors, s, are similar for different proteins. To test this, we selected the proteins from the list whose x-ray diffraction data were collected at the same temperature, namely at 100 K. As shown in Fig. S3, for eLCMB, there is no clear correlation between the scaling factor, s, and protein size. The standard deviation of the scaling factors for the eLCMB is 30%, whereas it is 40% for the GNM. On the other hand, the overall scaling factor of the ROM shows a clear dependence on protein size, with smaller proteins having larger

scaling factors, suggesting that in a crystalline environment, smaller proteins have larger rigid-body rotational amplitudes on average. Combining ROM with eLCMB by treating ROM (Eq. 11) as an additive term to Eq. 5 yields an optimized R value of 0.751, which slightly improves the correlation obtained by the eLCMB alone. When considering all atoms, on the other hand, the combination of ROM with eLCMB does not improve the correlation.
The eLCMB is computationally efﬁcient. In its simplest implementation, its computational cost scales with O(N2), where N is the number of protein atoms. For larger proteins, the use of cell subdivision with appropriate cutoffs permits computational scaling by O(N). By contrast, the ENM models involve the inversion of a Kirchhoff or Hessian matrix of dimension M or 3M, which scales with O(M3), where M is the number of amino acids. For the 54-kDa protein cholesterol oxidase (1N4W), the eLCMB calculation with crystal contacts included takes on a 2.4 GHz opteron AMD processor <1 s.
A second advantage of the eLCMB is its applicability to all atoms of a protein, including all side-chain atoms. Protein side-chain atoms play a prominent role in protein function by their involvement in protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Therefore, rapid assessment of the atomic mobility of these entities and their changes upon complex formation is a useful complement to structural investigations.
This study demonstrates that, based on B-factors alone, it is difﬁcult to judge whether ENM-type or LDM/LCMB-type models are physically more meaningful. The fact that a mean-ﬁeld approximation, such as the local contact model, reproduces B-factors on a par with the CNM, which is now considered the most accurate ENM model, suggests that collective motions are not essential for the interpretation of B-factors at the level of accuracy achievable at the present time. Mean-ﬁeld models represent an attractive alternative to collective motional models. This ﬁnding is consistent with recent results obtained with the reorientational contact-weighted ENM for the prediction of protein backbone order parameters (23). This model provides an improvement over the local contact model mainly for protein regions that undergo signiﬁcant fraying effects. Similar to the modeling of the chain termini applied here, these can be treated without invoking a full ENM approach.
CONCLUSION
The extended local contact model is a mean-ﬁeld approach to protein dynamics whose average pairwise atomic distance PMF is consistent with MD results. This model shows good agreement between predicted and experimental B-factors, comparable to that of a reﬁned GNM model. The inclusion of crystal-contact effects is essential for obtaining accurate prediction in both types of models. This may have important implications also for the interpretation of dynamics data of protein crystals obtained by other

methods, such as solid state NMR. Its computational efﬁciency makes the eLCMB model applicable to backbone and side-chain atoms of small and large proteins alike.
