ABSTRACT: The advent of nanotechnology has seen a growing interest in the nature of ﬂuid ﬂow and transport under nanoconﬁnement. The present study leverages fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the eﬀect of
nanochannel length and intrusion of molecules of the organic solvent, hexaﬂuoro-2-propanol (HFIP), on the dynamical
characteristics of water within it. Favorable interactions of
HFIP with the nanochannels comprised of single-walled carbon
nanotubes traps them over time scales greater than 100 ns, and conﬁnement confers small but distinguishable spatial redistrib-
ution between neighboring HFIP pairs. Water molecules within
the nanochannels show clear signatures of dynamical slowdown
relative to bulk water even for pure systems. The presence of
HFIP causes further rotational and translational slowdown in waters when the nanochannel dimension falls below a critical length of 30 Å. The enhanced slowdown in the presence of HFIP is quantiﬁed from characteristic relaxation parameters and diﬀusion coeﬃcients in the absence and presence of HFIP. It is ﬁnally seen that the net ﬂow of water between the ends of the
nanochannel shows a decreasing dependence with nanochannel length only when the number of HFIP molecules is small.
These results lend insights into devising ways of modulating solvent properties within nanochannels with cosolvent impurities.

■ INTRODUCTION
Concurrent with advances in nanotechnology, the last two decades have observed a growing interest in ﬂuid transport within molecular conﬁnement.1−4 Such studies are valuable in
the design of controlled transporters within micro- and nanoﬂuidic devices. In general, phase, structural, and dynamical characteristics of ﬂuids under conﬁned geometries are diﬀerent from those in bulk.5−7 It has been established that the spontaneous entry of a ﬂuid such as water within the conﬁnes of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is favorable thermodynamically.8 Experimental studies demonstrate that CNTs confer a ﬂuid ﬂow rate enhancement of a few orders of
magnitude over those predicted within the hydrodynamic framework.9,10 In the case of water, these observations are well
supported by theoretical considerations and can be explained
by the strong propensity of hydrogen bonding between water molecules, a depletion layer at the water−CNT interface, and an eﬀective sharp reduction in the frictional coeﬃcient due to the curvature of the CNT surface.11−13 In addition to manifold ramiﬁcations in nanotechnological applications, understanding water ﬂow under conﬁnement is of crucial importance in

biology, in large part due to the vast landscape of its functions in maintaining charge balance and homeostatis across the cellular membrane.14−16
The ability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to connect atomic-level information with measurable quantities has been leveraged extensively to probe solvent behavior within axial nanochannels. MD simulations enable examination of the inﬂuence of intrinsic CNT characteristics as well as the application of nonequilibrium eﬀects on ﬂow properties.8,17,18 It is observed that conﬁned water shows bulklike properties beyond CNT diameters of 1.4 nm.8 It has been suggested that solvent characteristics within CNT are associated with thermal ﬂuctuations of the connected bath.19 Flow control has primarily been achieved by applying pressure or an electric ﬁeld along the axial direction.20,21 It is noticed that the ﬂow is markedly enhanced over those yielded by the no-slip Hagen−

Poisseuille relationship.9,10,19 Interestingly, it has been reported that surface roughness and introduction of defects aﬀect water ﬂow associated with CNTs.22,23 Furthermore, the presence of ions and organic cosolvents has diﬀerential eﬀects on water ﬂow. While the presence of salts can drive osmotic ﬂow through CNTs separating compartments with diﬀerential concentration,24 interactions of CNT aromatic rings with cations can hinder the eﬀective ﬂow of water.25 In contrast,
hydrophobic methane and the polar methanol molecules fully
displace water in a stepwise fashion to enter CNTs of narrow diameter and form single chains or biwires within.26,27 Simulations with urea indicate the molecule’s preferential interaction with CNT, resulting in structured ﬂow and markedly longer lifetimes over water.28,29 These results suggest
that tuning molecular interactions within the CNT cavity could
be leveraged to control water transport through nanochannels. Characteristics of conﬁned water are distinct from those in
the bulk phase.3,30−32 Studies of these diﬀerences have several
important bearings, including the role of biological water under conﬁnement and in the design of micro- and nanoﬂuidic devices. Water within nanoscalar conﬁnement can be slower
than bulk water depending on interfacial geometry and the physicochemical nature of the conﬁning surface.33−36 MD
simulations show that slowdown in both translational and
orientational dynamics sets in within nanochannels below a critically low diameter.37 Yet, combined MD simulations and
density functional theory (DFT) studies show that water
retains its bulklike hydrogen bonding network even under extreme conﬁnement.38 Water localization and ordering are
found to depend on the nature of the chemical environment within the conﬁnement.38,39 Anomalous eﬀects and liquid− liquid phase transitions of water conﬁned in CNTs are reported to shift to lower temperatures.40
In the present work, we leverage fully atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate how the presence of an organic molecule, namely the ﬂuorinated alcohol hexaﬂuoro-2-propanol (HFIP), aﬀects the equilibrium character-
istics of water within nanochannels connecting single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of variable length that connect aqueous reservoirs. HFIP is a versatile organic solvent41 and, moreover, is frequently used to tune solvent eﬀects on biomolecular structure and dynamics.42−45 The triﬂuoromethyl
(CF3) groups present in HFIP have a propensity for favorable interactions with aromatic carbons.46,47 Our simulations show
that HFIP enters the SWCNT axial cavity spontaneously by
replacement of water molecules, exhibits a retarded orientation
inside, and, unlike water, does not exit the channel on
nanosecond time scales. These characteristics prevent its lateral
association and molecular wire formation within the SWCNT
nanochannel. In this context, therefore, we are able to treat
HFIP as a molecular contaminant within the SWCNT and evaluate its inﬂuence on water dynamics as a function of
nanochannel length. Our investigations show that in the
absence of the molecular contaminant, the slowdown in translational and rotational dynamics of conﬁned water over
bulk water is largely independent of nanochannel length, and the diﬀusion coeﬃcients calculated within the Green−Kubo
framework show only a small variation with length. Intrusion and conﬁnement of HFIP molecules bring about a further,
distinct slowdown for water molecules within nanochannels of lengths shorter than 30 Å; the diﬀusion coeﬃcients do not change signiﬁcantly within longer nanochannels. We ﬁnd that for a low HFIP number, the equilibrium water ﬂow decreases

with channel length in a manner similar to that obtained with external eﬀects.
■ METHODS System Setup. Nine armchair SWCNTs of (10, 10) chirality and diameter of 13.6 Å, with varying lengths (L), were generated with Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD).48 We point out that the SWCNT diameter chosen is nearly amenable to bulklike characteristics of conﬁned water.8 The SWCNT lengths (L) chosen were 10 Å, 15 Å, 20 Å, 25 Å, 30 Å, 35 Å, 40 Å, 45 Å, and 50 Å. The axis of each SWCNT was made parallel to the z-axis of the coordinate system, with its midpoint coinciding with the origin. Each SWCNT end was combined with a square graphene sheet measuring 10 Å on each side, with the graphene plane perpendicular to the SWCNT axis. Appropriate circular pores of the same diameter as the SWCNTs and aligned with them were incorporated in the graphene sheeets. The nanotube and sheets were held ﬁxed with a harmonic force constant of 20 kcal mol−1 Å−2. A wellequilibrated water reservoir containing 2322 TIP3P49 water molecules was added to each side of the graphene sheet to generate systems that were purely aqueous (designated “pure” systems). In addition, a separate equilibration was carried out of a solvent box of the same dimensions but with an appropriate number of waters replaced with 27 hexaﬂuoro-2propanol (or HFIP). Prior to incorporation in the systems, each solvent reservoir was ﬁrst independently equilibrated for several nanoseconds in the isothermal−isobaric ensemble at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar. Accordingly, nine systems with a water−HFIP equilibrated solvent reservoir on one side and a pure water reservoir on the other side were generated (designated “mixed” systems). Representative snapshots of a “pure” and a “mixed” system for L = 25 Å are depicted in Figure 1.
Simulation Details. Graphene and SWCNT carbon atoms were modeled as the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms of the CHARMM22 force ﬁeld50,51 and the HFIP force ﬁeld reported by Fioroni et al. were used.52 We point out that these parameters have been used in conjunction with standardized

force ﬁelds and water mixtures in previous simulation studies.42,43,53,54 The NAMD 2.9 simulation package was used.55 Energy minimizations of 15000 steps were ﬁrst performed for each system using the conjugate gradient method, followed by MD simulations of 120 ns in the isothermal−isobaric (NPT) ensemble at a constant temperature of 300 K and a constant pressure of 1 bar. Orthorhombic periodic boundary conditions were applied. The PBC size in the z-direction was set to be several times the system size in the z-direction, ensuring that the approach is similar to those applied in earlier simulations of nanochannel and membrane bilayer systems with separated solvent reservoirs.56,57 A cutoﬀ of 12 Å was used for nonbonded interactions with the smoothing starting at 11 Å. Particle mesh Ewald (PME) was used for the long-range electrostatics calculation.58 Constant temperature was maintained using Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency of 1 ps−1, and constant pressure was maintained with the Nose−́ Hoover Langevin piston method.59 Lengths of the bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm.60 Single trajectories were generated for each of the systems using a time step of 2 fs, with coordinates and velocities saved every 1 ps. In the case of the 10 Å mixed system, the trajectory was extended to 250 ns. For the autocorrelation analysis, four short trajectories were saved every 100 fs, over four 400 ps windows, starting at 86, 100, 110, and 120 ns of the parent trajectory. In addition, one pre-equilibrated trajectory over 400 ps windows, saved every 100 fs, was generated beginning 8 ns of the parent trajectory for a 20 Å mixed system. The number of HFIP molecules and water molecules within the nanochannel was constant over these short trajectories.
Trajectory Analyses. VMD was used for all visualizations.48 Normalized autocorrelation functions were calculated by averaging over multiple time origins and over multiple molecules, using high frequency trajectories saved over speciﬁed time windows mentioned in simulation details. This approach is routinely adopted in MD simulation studies of solvent dynamics.61−64 See the SI for details of solvent rotational relaxation (P2(t)), mean squared displacement (⟨(z(t) − z(0))2⟩), and velocity autocorrelation functions
■(Cov(t)). RESULTS
I. Characteristics of Nanochannel Filling. Consistent with previous reports, we ﬁnd spontaneous entry of water molecules within a few picoseconds of the start of the simulations in all pure and mixed systems of this study. On average, each nanochannel of the mixed systems is ﬁlled by 1.5 waters per Å of SWCNT within a few picoseconds of the start of the simulations. However, early entry of water is not accompanied by coentry of HFIP in the mixed systems. In Figure 2, we present the water occupancy number (NW) and the HFIP occupancy number (NHFIP) as a function of simulation time for the simulation of each CNT system. HFIP is found to enter the CNT nanochannels one molecule at a time and displays a very high probability to stay within. The corresponding NW plots demonstrate that each HFIP intrusion leads to a stepwise expulsion of water molecules from the nanochannel that appears more pronounced in the shorter nanochannels. We point out here that for the pure systems, the number of water molecules after equilibration is consistent with theoretical estimates using the Lennard-Jones parameter σCO involving the CNT-water oxygen interaction65 (see Table

any transient exit of an HFIP molecule occurring at the end of the nanochannel is found to be followed immediately by a reentry event. Overall, the displacement of water molecules by HFIP from the nanochannel interior is irreversible within time scales of tens of nanoseconds. Interestingly, no HFIP molecule is expelled into the pure water reservoir at the other end within the simulated timescale. This phenomenon is corroborated by one longer trajectory of the mixed systems (250 ns for 10 Å systems), presented in Figure S1. In Figure 3, we present the zcoordinate of the center of mass of each HFIP molecule for the nanochannel of three representative lengths. We observe a large ﬂuctuation in the z-coordinate, indicating the tendency of each molecule to rapidly traverse the conﬁnes of the nanochannel in the axial direction. It is noteworthy that the z-coordinate of no two molecules is identical at the same instance, indicating that unlike the water molecules, the HFIP molecules do not occupy positions that are lateral to each other. Furthermore, the apparent randomness in the zcoordinate indicates that unlike other cosolvents reported earlier, HFIP does not obey a single-ﬁle ﬂow but rather has a high tendency to positionally ﬂuctuate within the longitudinal conﬁnes of the nanochannel.
II. HFIP Interaction with the Nanochannel. The tendency of spontaneous entry of organic cosolvents into CNT nanochannels with water displacement has been rationalized in earlier studies with their strong interactions

with the CNT and lowering of the thermodynamic cost for their solvation. In Figure S2, we report the interactions with the entrant HFIP molecules with 1 Å length segments of the CNT over the last 40 ns of the simulation for 3 representative systems; the interaction with the waters within the nanochannels is shown as well. The data is presented as averages for each water and HFIP molecule within. Additionally, we report distributions of the total interaction strength of all individual HFIP molecules with the nanochannel; see Figure S3. We note that on average, an HFIP molecule interacts more favourably with the CNT compared to a water molecule in the inner segments by about 3.5 kcal mol−1. As mentioned earlier, triﬂuoromethyl groups are shown to have highly favorable interactions with aromatic groups in previous studies. This emerges from the breakup of the interactions of the CNT with chemical groups of the HFIP molecule presented in Table 2, wherein the triﬂuoromethyl groups are noted to be responsible for the bulk of the favorable interactions.
Spatial pair correlation functions indicate that Cc pair distances in pure HFIP have a ﬁrst and second maximum at about 4.3 Å and at a distance between 5 and 9 Å,

respectively.52 In the HFIP−water mixture in the isotropic
bulk phase, the second maximum gains growing prominence over the ﬁrst with increasing dilution. In this light, we
estimated the probability distributions of the distance between
the central carbon atoms (Cc) between HFIP molecules that form a nearest neighbor pair within the conﬁnes of the
nanochannel; corresponding distributions were also estimated
for distance between Cc and water oxygens (OW) within the nanochannel. We ﬁnd that the Cc−Cc distance shows bimodality when the number of water molecules within the
channel is high, commensurate with a lower number of HFIP molecules under conﬁnement. On the other hand, the Cc−OW has a single peak. An interesting pattern of results, depicted
in Figure 4, emerges from comparing normalized probability distributions over diﬀerent CNT lengths. For the shortest CNT of 10 Å length, the Cc−Cc distance probability is maximum at about 5 Å, and the Cc−OW distance distribution is the broadest with a long tail extending to about half the length of the nanochannel. For the CNT of 20 Å length, the ﬁrst peak in the Cc−Cc distribution is at about 4.5 Å though the second peak has a marginal shift to higher distances; the Cc−OW peaks

at the same distance of ∼3.5 Å as the shortest CNT system. For CNTs of longer lengths, the second peak in the Cc−Cc distribution gains prominence but is broader and generally shifts to the right. For the 40 Å system, the second peak occurs at about 6 Å, while there is a noticeable shoulder at this distance for the 50 Å system. Importantly, for the systems with longer CNTs, the Cc−OW peak is sharp at ∼3.5 Å with no tail at higher distances. This analysis shows that the increased solvation tendency of HFIP with nanochannel length disrupts the spatial correlation between the molecules (see Figure 5).

increases in τe within the longer channels, possibly due to greater solvation and a lesser degree of conﬁnement. Collectively, these results demonstrate that HFIP molecules have negligible tendency to exit the conﬁnes of the nanochannel, show low intermolecular spatial correlation, and a preference for solvation over clustering. Furthermore, they do not traverse as a single ﬁle of molecules along the nanochannel axis while demonstrating a slowed reorientational tendency.
III. Water Dynamical Characteristics. The dynamical characteristics of water at interfaces of nanoscopic dimensions and under conﬁnement deviate markedly from those observed in bulk water. Signatures of the extent of deviation from bulk behavior, estimated frequently by leveraging atomistic MD simulations, provide valuable information about the system. Herein, we report the results of our investigations of the dynamical characteristics of water within the nanochannels with varying CNT length and varying number of HFIP intrusions. In Figure 7a−c, we depict the normalized

For insights into the eﬀect of HFIP conﬁnement on its ﬂipping tendency, we calculated the normalized orientational
time correlation function (P2(t), as described in the SI for HFIP) within the channel and over multiple time origins as
described in Methods. This result is reported in Figure 6,
averaged over four data sets (see Figure S4), and compared
with equivalent functions calculated for HFIP in the reservoir.
While a marked slowdown in the rotational tendency is noted for HFIP within conﬁnement, we observe, in general, a greater
slowdown with an increase in the number of entrant molecules per unit length. This value (NHFIP′) is reported in Table S1 along with the average times (τe) required for the correlation functions to reach (1/e) of their values at t = 0. We note at least more than a 3-fold increase in τe for all the nanochannel systems over the reservoir value 2.6 ps. However, the length of the channel appears to have a slight inﬂuence, with lower

A noticeable slowdown in rotational dynamics is observed for the conﬁned water. Interestingly, in the absence of any cosolvent impurities, the slowdown shows only marginal variation with the nanochannel’s length. This is conﬁrmed by

nanochannels with CNT length between 10 and 25 Å, τemix is greater than τepure by a factor of 1.58 and 3.81; for channels of longer length, this factor varies between 0.11 and 0.65. Thus,
the intrusion of the cosolvent impurities confers a noticeable
length dependence on the rotational dynamics of the water molecules within the nanochannel’s conﬁnement, wherein
channels 30 Å and longer show the least slowdown. We next examined the mean squared displacement ⟨Δz2⟩, in
the direction parallel to the channel axis. The results, compared with corresponding ⟨Δz2⟩ for isotropic bulk water, are presented in Figure 8 (a−c for the pure system; d−f for the
mixed system that is averaged over four data sets). The data at four diﬀerent times of each mixed system is shown in Figure S6
of the Supporting Information. Similar to the observation in
rotational dynamics, the translational dynamics parallel to the
nanotube axis is slower than the dynamics in bulk water.
Furthermore, the longitudinal translational dynamics within
the channel shows low sensitivity to the length of CNT in the absence of HFIP; the intrusion and conﬁnement of HFIP,

For comparison, we report the slopes of the ⟨Δz2⟩ between 9 and 10 ps by ﬁts of the corresponding data to a straight line; these values for the pure (mpure) and the mixed (mmix) systems are reported in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. We ﬁnd that mpure varies between 0.53 and 0.76, showing little variation and no distinct dependence on the CNT length. On the other hand, mmix varies between 0.09 and 0.11 for CNT lengths between 15 and 25 Å and increases markedly to higher values between 0.29 and 0.54 from 30 Å onward. We do note, however, that the shortest nanochannel of length 10 Å describes an anomalous behavior with an enhancement in the longitudinal translational dynamics of water with the intrusion of HFIP; the mmix for this system is 0.50.
We further investigate the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) of the conﬁned water molecules as a function of channel length and the number of conﬁned HFIPs. As discussed earlier, the VACF describes the collective translational dynamics of a solvent and yields the diﬀusion coeﬃcient within the Green−Kubo formalism. In Figure 9, we depict the VACF calculated for the water molecules within the simulated channel for the pure and the mixed systems; for the latter, averages calculated from four time windows are presented (see Figure S7 for individual results). The data have been compared with the VACF for bulk water. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient values obtained for the pure systems (Dpure) and the averages for the mixed (Dmix) systems are reported in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. As evident in Figure 9a−c, the variation in the VACF is minor and shows no clear trend with nanochannel length in the absence of HFIP; under these conditions, the average value of Dpure is (3.29 ± 0.52) × 10−5 cm2 s−1 compared to a value of about 5.9 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 for bulk water. With the intrusion of HFIP, however, the diﬀusion coeﬃcients of water show a variation with channel length, with Dmix changing by a factor varying from 0.04 to 0.21 over the average Dpure. This analysis shows that changes in the diﬀusive properties of water within the nanochannel with the inclusion of trapped cosolvent impurities are dependent on the longitudinal dimensions.

For insights into the apparently anomalous translational behavior observed at the shortest nanochannel system, we calculated the number of HFIP molecules per Å of nanochannel axial dimensions corresponding to the trajectory segments used for the autocorrelation functions. This value, NHFIP′, is included in Table S1. We notice that NHFIP′ is markedly larger for the shorter channels with values between 0.3 and 0.4 for CNT lengths 25 Å and below; this value is largest for the shortest CNT length of 10 Å. As discussed, the values of Dmix for these systems deviate the most from the corresponding values of Dpure. For the nanochannels of lengths between 30 and 50 Å, NHFIP′ varies between 0.09 and 0.23, commensurate with Dmix values that largely remain invariant over the corresponding Dpure values. In Figure 10, we have

plotted the ratios (τepure/τemix), (mpure/mmix), and (Dpure/Dmix) as a function of the SWCNT axial length. For each quantity, a clear deviation in the trend occurs at an axial length of 25 Å, indicating a switchover at such a nanochannel length for systems with the chosen cosolvent. For additional insights, we estimated the P2(t) and the VACF for the mixed system of 20 Å length (see Figure S8), over a short time segment starting at

8 ns of the simulation, before equilibration is reached (see the
Supporting Information). In this short time window, the value of NHFIP′ is only 0.1, compared to the value of 0.3 after equilibration (see Table S2). As seen in Figure S8 and Table
S2, P2(t) shifts toward more bulklike values with an increase in τemix to 1.60 and an increase (τepure/τemix) of 0.41. Correspondingly, the Dmix obtained from the VACF increases to 3.68 cm2 s−1, and (Dpure/Dmix) lowers to 0.89.
■ DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this exposition, we report the entry of an organic cosolvent, hexaﬂuoro-2-propanol (HFIP), from a reservoir into SWCNT nanochannels of ﬁxed diameter and varying lengths by
displacement of water molecules and the associated dynamics of the conﬁned waters upon attainment of equilibrium. While
HFIP entry is spontaneous and results in equal water expulsion
per entry in each nanochannel, their spatial distributions
depend on the length of channel, with HFIP spaced closer
together in shorter nanochannels of length up to 25 Å. Despite
highly favorable interactions with the SWCNT walls, HFIP
describes random axial movement without evidence of lateral conﬁgurations involving more than one molecule. Interestingly,
the HFIP molecules do not exit from the channel within the
simulated time scales, even to the pure water reservoir. Such conﬁnement of HFIP confers dynamical consequences on the
water molecules that coexist within the nanochannel. The
reorientational dynamics of water, while distinctly slower than
bulk, are found to vary negligibly with nanochannel length in
the absence of cosolvent. Entry of HFIP triggers a general
slowdown on the reorientational dynamics, especially on the
shorter channels of lengths up to 25 Å. The mean square
displacement along the axis is also slower, except at the shortest length. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient for each system is
estimated from the velocity autocorrelation function using the Green−Kubo formalism. As with the reorientation dynamics, the diﬀusion is slowed down signiﬁcantly up to a channel length of 25 Å, above which diﬀerences with systems without HFIP are not distinguishable. Moreover, larger ﬂuctuations in diﬀusion coeﬃcients for water in the presence of HFIP within
shorter nanochannels are observed. The plausible reasons for
these observations could be the smaller number of water
molecules within the shorter nanochannels in the presence of HFIP (see NHFIP′ values in Table S1).
Our results may lend useful insights in design for manipulating ﬂow control within nanochannels and the design of nanoﬂuidic
devices. Herein, we note reports that show an exponential decrease in ﬂow rate with length of a nanochannel under the eﬀect of external forces.19,21 For a preliminary understanding, we have estimated the average ﬂow rate across the mixed
systems as a function of length with a varying number of HFIP.
This calculation, described in the Supporting Information,
considers metastable time windows corresponding to a
constant number of HFIP molecules within the channel. As seen in Figure S9, the average ﬂow rate decreases with
increasing nanochannel length when the HFIP intrusion number is 3 or lower. For the number of conﬁned HFIPs exceeding this number, the ﬂow shows little variation, if any,
with length. In light of emerging insights into the mechanistic aspects of solvent permeability across channels,66,67 our continuing work will focus on the correlation between eﬀective chemical potential diﬀerence owing to HFIP concentrations
across the nanochannel as a function of nanochannel length.
Detailed studies are further necessary to correlate how factors

such as temperature may play a role in these observations and how combining molecular impurities with external eﬀects such as pressure and electric ﬁeld may oﬀer better modulation of the ﬂow rate.
