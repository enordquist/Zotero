Abstract

Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) and Vascular-Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) are promising targets for the design of novel inhibitors in anticancer therapeutics. In a recent work, our group designed a set of potential dual inhibitors predicted to occupy an allosteric back pocket near the active site of both enzymes, but their dynamic and unbinding behavior was unclear. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) and metadynamics (meta-D) simulations to study two of these virtual candidates (herein called IQ2 and IQ3). Their binding mode was predicted to be similar to that observed in LQ5 and BAX, well-known back-pocket binders of CDK2 and VEGFR2, respectively, including H-bonding with critical residues such as Leu83/Cys113 and Asp145/Asp190 (but excepting H-bonding with Glu51/Glu111) in CDK2/VEGFR2, correspondingly. Likewise, while LQ5 and BAX unbound through the allosteric channel as expected for type-IIA inhibitors, IQ2 and IQ3 unbound via the ATP channel (except for CDK2-IQ2) as expected for type-I½A inhibitors. Interestingly, a C-C single/double bond difference between IQ2/IQ3, respectively, resulted associated with differences in the AS/T loop flexibility observed for CDK2. These insights will help developing scaffold modifications during an optimization stage, serving as a starting point to develop dual kinase inhibitors in challenging biological targets with a promising anticancer potential.
