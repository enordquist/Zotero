Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family members are known as facilitators of immune responses by interacting with receptors on antigen-presenting cells leading to Hsp70-peptide uptake and antigen cross priming. Here, identification of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24-restricted epitopes was achieved using peptide arrays for evaluation of their affinities to Hsp70 and HLA-A24 binding prediction tools. Using Hsp70 as the model antigen, the GYPVTNAVI and VFQHGKVEI peptides were identified as antigens. These peptides actually bound to HLA-A24 in the stabilization assay using T2-A*2402 cells, and induced a strong peptide-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte response in HLA-A24 transgenic mice after vaccination.
[Key words: Hsp70, peptide array, chaperone, HLA-A24 restricted epitopes, antitumor vaccines]

Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are molecular chaperones that participate in numerous normal cellular processes such as protein folding, transport, and peptide processing and trafficking. Recently, Hsps have been shown to serve as facilitators of immune responses in tumors in vivo and in vitro (1–8). Hsp70, Hsp90, gp96, calreticulin, and Hsp110 have been reported to form highly immunogenic Hsp-peptide complexes. Immunization with Hsp70 purified from tumor cells containing tumor-specific peptides induces a strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against tumor cells after autologous vaccination (7–10). Hsp70 expressed under hyperthermia has also been reported to induce antitumor immunity by producing the Hsp70-immune complex via necrotic tumor cell death in vivo (11). Furthermore, synthetic peptides fused to Hsp70 in vitro induce MHC class I-restricted CTL responses (9).
Hsps facilitate induction of the immune responses by the following mechanisms. Hsp70 and several other molecular chaperones have the ability to bind to antigenic peptides stably in the cytosol of tumor cells during antigen processing. Hsps are efficiently internalized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via receptor-mediated endocytosis (12). Following internalization, these proteins are trafficked into different cellular compartments in which chaperoned peptides are released, processed, and made available for assembly into new major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (13).

The common receptor CD91 as well as other receptors mediate internalization of chaperone proteins and induce phenotypic and functional maturation in APCs (12, 14–17). Because Hsp-peptide complexes exhibit these qualities that are conducive to evoking an immune response, effective tumor vaccines can be designed from peptides that have high affinities to Hsps and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules.
In this study, we developed a methodology for identification of peptide antigens from highly expressed proteins in tumors using peptide arrays and HLA binding prediction tools. To meet the demand for a design of order-made tumor vaccines, it is necessary to develop a method for the identification and design of HLA epitopes that can efficiently be internalized and processed for assembly into HLA molecules. Here, Hsp70, which is the major stress responsive protein overexpressed frequently in human tumors of various origins but not in most physiological normal tissues, was selected as a model antigen, and the affinities of the Hsp70derived peptides to the Hsp70 chaperone was investigated using peptide arrays. Because Hsp70 upregulated in tumor cells or Hsp70-rich cell lysates by heat- or drug-induced stress or gene transfection has been reported to increase tumor immunogenicity (6, 18, 19), Hsp70-derived peptides can be used as multivalent, autologous vaccines for tumor cells. The HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitope peptide at Hsp70391–399 (LLLLDVAPL) (20) has already been reported as a valuable target for CTL in broad spectrum cancer immunotherapy. A peptide array is synthesized on a cellulose membrane support using the SPOT technology by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis (21). It enables the synthesis of a variety of peptides from the C-terminus to the N-terminus in a parallel manner on one membrane. This peptide array

can be a versatile tool for molecular recognition and screening of biologically active peptides (22–25). In vitro assessment of the affinity of a peptide to Hsp70 would be useful for determining the ability to be presented by MHC molecules as the antigen peptide.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of peptide arrays covering the amino acid sequence of Hsp70 A peptide library covering the entire Hsp70 sequence was prepared by automated spot synthesis (21). Peptide arrays covering Hsp70 sequence (9-mer peptide fragments with a two-residue shift, resulting in 282 spots) were constructed in triplicate. Reference spots used to define a positive affinity to Hsp70 were ALLLSAPRR (26), IPGLPLSL (27, 28), and VYDFFVWL (9). The negative control sequence of AAAAAAAAA was used. Standard Fmoc chemistry was used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Intavis, Köln, Germany) using a peptide autospotter (model ASP222; Intavis) as described previously with some modifications (23, 24). The concentration of activated amino acids was 0.5 M. The side-chain protecting group was removed by 3 h incubation in a mixed solvent of trifluoroacetic acid, tioanisol, ethandiol, and m-cresol (at a ratio of 40 :6 : 3 :1).
Hsp70 binding assay using peptide arrays Hsp70 binding assay using peptide arrays was performed as described by Rüdinger et al. (29). A peptide array was soaked in blocking buffer (Trisbuffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 [TBS-T] and 0.4% block-ace [Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Osaka]) for 1 h. Then, human recombinant Hsp70 (150 nM, no. NSP-555; Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was incubated with the peptides on the peptide array in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Unbound Hsp70 was removed by washing the array four times with TBS-T. The peptide-bound Hsp70 was electrotransferred onto polyvinylene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. After blotting, the PVDF membranes were washed and then labeled with mouse antihuman Hsp70 (SPA-810; Stressgen Bioreagents, British Columbia, Canada) and HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG, and chemiluminescence was detected using an ECL advance western blotting kit (RPN2135; Invitrogen, Japan K.K., Tokyo).
Peptide binding affinity to HLA-A24 Estimation of HLAA24-restricted epitopes was performed using the prediction tool BIMAS (http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov). Peptides predicted to have high binding affinities to HLA-A24 were then subjected to HLAA24 stabilization assay using T2-A*2402 cells. HLA-A*2402 is a common and widely distributed allele. T2-A*2402 cells, which are the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-deficient human T2 cells transfected with an MHC class I cDNA derived from the human HLA-A*2402 molecule. After incubation of cells in culture medium at 26°C for 18 h, the cells (2 ×105) were suspended in 1 ml of MEM containing 3 mg/ml β2-microglobulin in the presence or absence of a peptide (100 µg). The cells were then incubated at 26°C for 3 h and then at 37°C for 3 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-HLA-A24 mAb (c7709A2.6, kindly provided by Dr. P. G. Coulie, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels Branch) at 4°C for 30 min. Then, the cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at 4°C for 30 min. The cells were suspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1% formaldehyde and analyzed using FACSVantage (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Binding affinity was evaluated by comparing the mean fluorescence intensity of HLA-A24 in the presence of peptide pulsation with that of no peptide. Positive control peptides for HLA-A24 were the survivin-2B peptide (AYACNTSTL) and HIV peptide (SFHSLHLLF). The negative control peptide was the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-8 peptide (RGYVYQGL), which binds to mouse H-2Kb.

Vaccination and induction of CTL RMA-S-A*2402 cells
were RMA-S transfected with the gene encoding HLA-A*2402
(provided by Dr. H. Takasu, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharmaceutical,
Osaka). The mouse thymoma cell line (E.G7 cells; EL-4 cells
transfected with cDNA encoding OVA) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HLA-A*2402/Kb transgenic
mice were purchased from SLC Japan. The mice were kept in a specific pathogen-free mouse facility. Each HLA-A*2402/Kb trans-
genic mouse was immunized with one of the Hsp70-derived peptides (50 µg) with incomplete Freunds adjuvant (IFA) subcutaneously at the base of the tail four times at 1 week intervals. One
week after the last immunization, spleen cells were removed, and
cultured in vitro with irradiated (100 Gy) and candidate peptide-
pulsed spleen cells for 5 days. Subsequently, the generation of peptide-specific CTLs was evaluated by 51Cr release assay. The specificity of CTLs induced in an individual HLA-A*2402/Kb trans-
genic mouse was evaluated using RMA-S/A*2402 cells as the tar-
get in the presence or absence of the candidate peptide. 51Cr release assay The cytolytic activity of the induced CTL
was determined by a standard 4-h 51Cr release assay. Target cells were labeled with 50 µCi 51Cr-labeled sodium chromate in RPMI with 10% FCS for 1 h at 37°C and then washed twice with RPMI. Target cells (5 ×103) were added to a titrated CTL effectors in 96well round-bottom plates with a final volume of 200 µl of RPMI with 10% FCS. The cells were centrifuged to promote cell contact and then incubated at 37°C for 4 h. The supernatant (100 µl) from each well was harvested manually. Radioactivity released into the
supernatant was measured using a gamma counter, and percent
specific release was calculated from the mean of duplicate cultures
using the following formula:

Percent specific release =

(experimental release − spontaneous release) (maximal release − spontaneous release)

× 100

For peptide-pulsed target cells, RMA-S/A*2402 cells were incubated with 1 µg/ml peptide at room temperature for 1 h before the assay.

RESULTS
Hsp70 binding assay on peptide array The design of a universal tumor vaccine requires the identification of tumor antigens expressed in the majority of tumors. Because Hsps have recently been shown to participate in the generation of anti-tumor immunity, the binding affinity of Hsp70 to an Hsp70-derived 9-mer peptide was investigated. Figure 1 shows the typical results of the Hsp70 binding assay obtained by dot-blot analysis using peptide arrays. The average relative binding intensity of the negative control peptide was below 1000. This value was calculated from three different cellulose membranes with six spots. In contrast, the average relative binding intensities of the positive control sequences from three spots on four different cellulose membranes were 17,620, 13,300, and 18,630 for ALLLSAPRR, IPGLPLSL, and VYDFFVWL, respectively. Because these sequences were reported to bind DnaK or Hsp70 (25), screening of Hsp70-binding peptides using peptide arrays appeared feasible. The binding of Hsp70 to cellulose-bound peptides was also examined using ATP or ADP. The Hsp70-binding patterns were similar with and without the addition of ADP, and the bound Hsp70 was released following the addition of 2 mM ATP (Fig. 2). Therefore, the release of Hsp70-chaper-

FIG. 1. Binding assay of human Hsp70 using peptide arrays. Peptides (9 mers) derived from human Hsp70 were screened for their binding to human Hsp70. Reference spots used to define a positive affinity to Hsp70 were ALLLSAPRR (a), IPGLPLSL (b), and VYDFFVWL (c), and the negative control for binding was AAAAAAAAA (d).

FIG. 2. ATP-dependent hydrolysis of bound Hsp70. Binding of Hsp70 to cellulose-bound peptides was performed in the presence of 2 mM ATP (A) or 2 mM ADP (B). The assay was also performed in the absence of ATP and ADP (C). The Hsp70 binding spot patterns for panels B and C were similar, and no spot was detected in panel A.

oned peptides was also observed in an ATP-dependent manner on peptide arrays.
Table 1 shows peptides with relative binding intensities greater than 13,000 (p < 0.05). The highest binding intensity was obtained with peptide no. 82 at Hsp163–171 (VIAGLNVLR). Thirty-three peptides out of the 282 sequences tested exhibited high affinities to Hsp70. These data indicate that Hsp70high-affinity peptides can be identified using peptide arrays.
Evaluation of Hsp70 binding intensity using peptides that are predicted to have high affinities to HLA-A2402 molecule The Hsp70 binding intensities of peptides that are predicted to have high affinities to HLA-A2402 were investigated (Table 2). The gene frequency of HLA-A24 is relatively high in Asian populations, particularly in Japanese whereas it is low in Caucasians. HLA-A24 is one of the most common HLA-A antigens in the Japanese (58.1%) (30). The 9-mer peptide library with a 1-mer shift was subjected to MHC binding prediction using the tool BIMAS. The highest BIMAS score of 200 was obtained using no. 53′ at Hsp70106–114. There were 16 peptides that were predicted to show high affinities to HLA-A24 with BIMAS scores above 8. The Hsp70-binding intensities of these peptides were investi-

gated, and eight peptides showed high affinities to Hsp70 with relative binding intensities greater than 20,000. Table 2 shows the relative binding intensity of Hsp70 as determined from the average value of eight spots. Two peptides that bound to Hsp70 with relative binding intensities greater than 20,000 and with BIMAS scores of 75 (no. 68′ at Hsp70136–144 [GYPVTNAVI]) and 8 (no. 10′ at Hsp7020–28 [VFQHGKVEI]) were selected as candidate peptides for HLA-A*2402 binding analysis. Negative control peptides that had higher BIMAS scores but had low affinities for Hsp70 were selected: peptide no. 53′ at Hsp70106–114 (SYKGETKAF).
Evaluation of HLA-A*2402 binding affinity Peptide binding affinity to HLA-A24 was evaluated by stabilization assay using synthesized candidate peptides. MHC class I molecules become unstable in the absence of binding peptides. Because T2-A*2402 cells lack TAP molecules, which transport peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, the expression levels of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface are lower than those of wild-type T1 cells. In the presence of binding peptides, stabilization of MHC class I leads to upregulation of these molecules on the cell surface. Three (53′, 68′, and 10′) of the four tested Hsp70-derived peptides

were capable of increasing HLA-A24 level on T2-A*2402 cells (Fig. 3). The survivin-2B and HIV peptides, which have been shown to be HLA-A24-binding CTL epitopes, increased HLA-A24 level as well. The VSV8 peptide, which is an H-2Kb binding peptide, failed to increase HLA-A24 level. These observations indicate that these peptides (53′, 68′, and 10′) have high affinities to HLA-A*2402 that are comparable to those of the survivin-2B and HIV peptides.
HLA-A24-restricted CTL induction by immunizing with candidate peptides HLA-A*2402/Kb transgenic mice, which are a well-established model for studying HLAA*2402-restricted CTL epitopes and vaccine development, express the human α1 and α2 domains of HLA-A*2402 and the mouse α3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of H-2Kb, which increases the level of T cell responsiveness. These transgenic mice were immunized with the candidate

FIG. 4. Induction of peptide-specific CTL responses by immunization of HLA-A*2402/Kb transgenic mice with candidate peptides. Spleen cells of mice immunized with peptides 68′ (A) and 10′ (B) showed significant cytotoxicity against peptide-coated RMA-S-A*2402 cells (closed circles) but not against non-peptide-coated RMA-S-A*2402 cells (open circles). Peptide no. 53′ (C) with a high affinity to HLA-A24 and a low
affinity to Hsp70 was also investigated. E.G7 cells, which are EL-4 thymoma cells transfected with OVA and do not express HLA-A*2402, did not exhibit cytotoxicity in the case of immunization using peptide 68′ (A) and 10′ (B) (closed triangles).

peptides (53′, 68′, and 10′), and the induction of peptide-specific CTL responses was examined following immunization. Spleen cells of mice immunized with peptides 68′ and 10′ showed significant cytotoxicity against peptide-68′-coated and peptide-10′-coated RMA-S-A*2402 cells but not against noncoated RMA-S-A*2402 cells or EL-4 cells, which do not express HLA-A*2402 (Fig. 4). In the case of immunization with peptide 53′, a change in the CTL response was not observed with peptide-coated or non-peptide-coated RMAS-A*2402 cells. Therefore, these results show that efficient HLA-A*2402-restricted epitopes were identified in Hsp70derived peptides that exhibit high binding affinities to Hsp70.
DISCUSSION
Hsp70 and several other molecular chaperones have been implicated as targets for immunotherapy protocols primarily owing to their ability to bind stability to antigenic peptides in the cytosol of tumor cells during antigen processing. In this study, we implemented a new strategy for the identification of useful antigenic peptides for the design of antitumor vaccines from a highly expressed protein target using peptide arrays. The peptides that displayed high affinites to Hsp70 were also evaluated for their affinities to HLA molecules. Of the 36 identified peptides (Table 1), 15 peptides had BIMAS scores greater than 10. Peptide no. 197 at Hsp70391–399 (LLLLDVAPL), which was previously reported as an HLAA*0201-restricted CTL epitope (20), was successfully identified as a candidate antigenic peptide with a relative Hsp70binding intensity of 27640 and a BIMAS score of 309. To test the hypothesis that peptides with a high affinity to Hsp70 form Hsps-peptide complexes and work effectively in antigen presentation, CTL-inducing epitope peptides for HLAA24 were screened. Two HLA-A24-restricted epitopes were identified (Fig. 4). The increased efficacy of peptides with a

high affinity to Hsp70 to induce specific CTL responses was demonstrated. Measurement of the affinity of a peptide to Hsp70 was valuable for designing antigen peptides. Seventeen peptides had BIMAS scores between the scores of these two peptides with substantial affinities to Hsp70 (Table 2); thus, these peptides were considered candidates for triggering CTL responses.
In conclusion, we have discovered two universal HLAA24-restricted epitopes (68′ and 10′) by peptide array analysis for identifying Hsp70-derived 9-mer peptides that have high affinities to Hsp70. The proposed method is also applicable to screening of Hsps-high-affinity peptides from highly expressed target proteins in tissues for identification and design of order-made antitumor vaccines. The high-throughput screening method for the measurement of Hsp70-binding affinity provides a versatile tool for the identification of new antigenic peptides from target proteins.
