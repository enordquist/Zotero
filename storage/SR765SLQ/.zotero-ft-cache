Abstract

Genetic evidence indicates central roles for Hsp70 chaperones in the regulation of heat shock gene expression. This regulatory function has been postulated for Escherichia coli to rely on the direct association of DnaK (Hsp70) with the heat shock transcription factor σ 32 . This report presents evidence for the physical association of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones with σ 32 in vivo. Surprisingly, an interaction of DnaJ with σ 32 exists that is distinguishable from an interaction of DnaK and GrpE with σ 32 : addition of ATP disrupts the association of DnaK and GrpE with σ 32 , but not the association of DnaJ with σ 32 . Furthermore, DnaJ- σ 32 and DnaK- σ 32 associations occur independent of DnaK and DnaJ, respectively. These results suggest distinct regulatory functions of DnaJ and DnaK/GrpE.

    Citation Excerpt :

    We observed a rapid rise in HspQ protein level upon transition from 25°C to 45°C, with a significant increase within 7 min, reaching maximal increase (∼6-fold) within 15 min of heat-shock induction (Figure 1A). This rapid increase in HspQ level was transient, reminiscent of the prototypical pattern of heat-shock gene expression (Gamer et al., 1992; Herman et al., 1995; Straus et al., 1987, 1990; Tilly et al., 1989), which decreases to a new equilibrium within 30 min (Figure 1A). Intriguingly, we also observed a 2-fold increase in HspQ level upon transition from 25°C to 37°C under conditions conducive to induction of the Y. pestis type three secretion system (T3SS), with an analogous transient expression pattern (Figure 1B).
