1. Introduction
The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the basic methodologies for including electronic polarization in present-day molecular mechanics (MM) force ﬁelds for biomolecules. We will restrict our treatment to empirical atomistic models of relatively low computational cost due to their popularity in current force ﬁeld development. Topics such as higher induced multipole moments, hyperpolarizability and polarizable continuum solvent models, as well as polarizable coarse-grained models, are left for a more specialized treatment elsewhere. We will highlight some of the most important achievements on the development and application of polarizable force ﬁelds in biomolecular simulation to date. A comprehensive review of these issues is, however, beyond the scope of this chapter. For further insight on polarizable force ﬁelds, the interested reader is referred to various review articles on the topic (1–8).
We will start by introducing the physical mechanisms of polarization in molecular systems (section 1.1) and emphasizing the importance of an explicit description of polarization effects

in biomolecular simulations (section 1.2). Section 2 covers the three most widely used methods for including electronic polarization in MM force ﬁelds, namely, the induced point dipole (IPD) (section 2.1), shell (section 2.2) and ﬂuctuating charge (FQ) (section 2.3) models. We will also brieﬂy cover other methodologies used to model electronic polarization in atomistic simulations (section 2.4). Section 3 provides a brief overview of the state-of-the-art of biomolecular simulations employing polarizable force ﬁelds. The chapter is concluded with an outlook on the future of polarizable force ﬁelds in classical molecular simulations (section 4).
The treatment of the subjects in this chapter is mainly technical in nature. We assume that the reader is familiar with the general features of atomistic force ﬁelds and handling of electrostatic interactions, introduced in the chapters by Monticelli and Tieleman, and Sagui et al., respectively.

1.1. Polarization

Electric polarization means the redistribution of charge in space due to an electric ﬁeld. For molecular systems, the polarizing electric ﬁeld can be simply due to the other molecules in a condensed-phase system or a macroscopic ﬁeld applied over the entire system. Classically, polarization of molecules is divided into three main contributions (see Fig. 1) (4):
1. Orientational polarization, which is the rigid rotation of molecules due to their coupling to an electric ﬁeld.
2. Geometric or atomic polarization, which results from the displacement of atoms in the molecules with respect to each other. In the language of MM force ﬁelds, these conformational changes can be due to bond stretching, valence angle bending, and rotations around dihedral angles.

1.2. Importance of Polarization Effects

3. Electronic polarization, which refers to changes in the electronic structure of the molecules, that is, redistribution of the electron clouds around the nuclei.
This division of polarization into distinct components is just an effective one, as in reality the different components of polarization are interrelated. Displacements of the atomic nuclei in a molecule will always results in electronic polarization up to some degree. However, we shall retain this division into distinct types of molecular polarization for the sake of discussion regarding force ﬁelds. Only such force ﬁelds which feature explicit models of electronic polarization are called polarizable force ﬁelds.
Taking electronic polarization into account results in adaptivity of the molecular models to their environment. As we shall see in section 2, the terms related to electronic polarization in the total potential energy function of the system cannot be treated simply as a sum of independent pairwise interactions. This non-additivity is an important property of polarizable force ﬁelds and it comes with a signiﬁcant increase in the computational time required to carry out the force and energy calculations.
Considerations of taking electronic polarizability explicitly into account in biomolecular simulations extend at least as far as the 1970s and the work of Warshel and co-workers (9, 10). The choice of excluding explicit treatment of electronic polarization in force ﬁelds has not been due to physical motivation, but rather because of practical reasons: the simplicity of the potential energy function and the reduced computational cost of additive force ﬁeld simulations. A common method to include electronic polarization effects – in an implicit manner – in non-polarizable force ﬁelds has been to ﬁt atomic partial charges to quantum-mechanically calculated electrostatic potentials. By using a theoretical framework which is known to overestimate molecular dipole moments, such as the HartreeFock method, the resulting partial charges are enhanced from their more realistic gas-phase values. This is then intended to reﬂect electronic polarization in condensed phases (3). The current nonpolarizable force ﬁelds can well reproduce structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of bulk organic compounds and various biological supramolecular structures, such as lipid bilayers. On the other hand, in general, they are not very accurate in reproducing the potential energy surfaces associated with molecular conformational changes (11–13). In the case of non-polar molecules, this issue can be remedied in part with the use of (ﬁxed) atom-based electric multipoles instead of point charges only. Polar molecules also require an explicit description of intramolecular polarization in order to reproduce gas-phase ab initio potential energy surfaces in a satisfactory manner.

218 H.S. Antila and E. Salonen
Polarization is an important contribution to the total potential energy of condensed-phase systems. It accounts to about 10–20% of the interaction energy between molecules at the van der Waals distance (effective distance of closest approach). For polar molecules electronic polarization is a signiﬁcant factor for the free energy of solvation even in solvents of low relative permittivity (14, 15). In this context it should be noted that force ﬁeld parameters optimized with ﬁxed partial charges commonly “embed” the molecular polarization energies in the other potential energy terms. An interesting exception to this practice is the SPC/E water model (16). The experimental potential energy that was used as a target for parameterizing the model was corrected by the polarization energy, resulting in more accurate values of density and diffusion coefﬁcient in comparison to the preceding SPC water model.
Biomolecular systems are inherently heterogeneous with respect to their chemical composition and physical properties. Including an explicit description of electronic polarization in force ﬁelds is very likely to improve the transferability of molecular models from one environment to another (11, 14). This is particularly important for the description of molecules in the vicinity of ions and for systems comprised of subregions of different dielectric properties. Biologically relevant examples of such systems are lipid bilayers, which are important components of cell membranes and serve as the native environments of membrane proteins. Lipid bilayers are characterized by large variations in the local relative permittivities. At the center of the bilayer the local permittivity is very low, E $ 1 À 2, but strongly increases towards the lipid-water interface, where the permittivity component in the bilayer plane has been estimated to reach values as high as Ek $ 100 À 1; 000 (17–19). With increasing distance from the bilayer center, the local permittivity gradually decreases to that of bulk water, E $ 80. The ability of force ﬁelds to properly reproduce the electrostatic potential difference over a lipid bilayer membrane and the partitioning of the amino acid residues of membrane proteins, as well as small solutes (e.g. drugs) into the membrane, is an important factor for the reliability of the empirical simulations (18–20).
Other examples of the importance of polarization effects in the context of biological macromolecules include folding and stabilization of local structures of proteins (21, 22), ligand-protein interactions (23, 24), and nucleic acids in the presence of divalent cations (6, 25). Water, as a highly polar compound and the environment of biomolecules, is an especially important molecule in force ﬁeld development. Various popular non-polarizable models of water (e.g., TIP3P, TIP4P, SPC, SPC/E, and their further modiﬁcations) have structural and electrostatic properties which are intermediate between those in the gas and liquid phases. The parameters employed in a force ﬁeld affect such important properties of water

9 Polarizable Force Fields 219
as surface tension, relative permittivity, hydrogen bond energies, and hydration energies of solvents. Various polarizable models of water produce a good description of both the gas and liquid phases (26–31). The adaptivity of the polarizable force ﬁelds is reﬂected in realistic values of molecular dipole moments in the gas (1.85 D) and liquid ( $ 2:5 À 2:9 D) phases. These models can be expected to pave the way toward more realistic simulation studies of interfacial systems.

2. Methods for Modelling Polarization
2.1. Induced Point Dipole Model 2.1.1. General Description

In this section we will overview the three most commonly used methodologies for including electronic polarization in MM force ﬁelds: the induced point dipole model (IDP) (section 2.1), the shell model (section 2.2), and the ﬂuctuating charge (FQ) model (section 2.3). The polarizable versions of the most widely used biomolecular force ﬁelds, such as CHARMM, OPLS, AMBER, and GROMOS, as well as entirely new polarizable force ﬁelds (e.g. AMOEBA (32, 33)), employ one of the methods covered here.
A popular approach for describing the redistribution of molecular charge (e.g. electronic polarization) is to use the electrostatic multipole expansion. The components of this expansion are the induced dipoles, quadrupoles, octupoles, and so forth. The ﬁrst two models featured in this section, the IPD and shell models, feature induced dipoles only. This choice has been motivated by the order of magnitudes of the multipole expansion terms, the dipole term being the most important one (4). In general, the energy associated with electronic polarization in the induced dipole approximation is a sum of three contributions,

U tot ¼ U pol þ U dipÀstat þ U dipÀdip

(1)

where Upol is the energy required to create the induced dipoles (polarization energy), UdipÀstat is the interaction energy between the dipoles and the static charge distribution (e.g. due to ﬁxed partial charges), and UdipÀdip is the interaction energy between the induced dipoles.
The third method featured in this section, the FQ model, produces all orders in the induced charge moments. As we will see in section 2.3, the total energy expression of this model is quite different from that of Eq. 1.

In the IPD model electronic polarization is described by polarizable point dipoles, which are assigned to some pre-selected sites in molecules. These sites are typically the atomic interaction centers (e.g., the nuclei). The total molecular polarization is a result of the

220 H.S. Antila and E. Salonen

interaction of these dipoles with each other and their environment. In the case of a single, isolated point dipole and assuming linear response, the induced dipole moment m is

m ¼ aEðrÞ;

(2)

where a is the 3 Â3 polarizability tensor of the dipole and E(r) is

the electric ﬁeld strength at its position r.

In a system consisting of N inducible dipoles, the dipole

moment i is given by the combined effect of the electric ﬁeld and

induction due to the other dipoles,

Here E0(ri) is the electric ﬁeld due to the static charge distribution in the system. In present-day force ﬁelds, this corresponds to the

where I is the unit tensor, and x, y, and z are the cartesian coordinates of the vector rij connecting the interacting dipoles i and j (rij   j rij j).
The coupling of the dipoles through the interaction tensor Tij in Eq. 3 means that the instantaneous values of the dipole moments are interdependent. A change in one of the dipole moments will induce a change in all the other ones. Calculating the energy of the system thus requires a self-consistent solution with respect to the induced dipole moments. To this end, Eq. 3 can be rewritten in the form of a matrix equation (35),

A~ m~ ¼ E~ ;

(5)

where A~ is a 3N Â3N matrix containing the inverses of the dipole polarizability tensors along the diagonal. E~ and m~ are 3N-compo-

nent vectors where the dipole moments mi and electric ﬁeld strength at each polarizable site Ei0 are given in the order corresponding to that of the polarizabilities in A~ . That is,

This exact method of solving the induced dipole moments through matrix inversion is an O(N 3) operation. Considering that a typical biomolecular simulation contains 104 À 106 atoms, it is clear that for actual dynamic simulations (such as molecular dynamics, MD), the matrix inversion method is unfeasible. Thus, one
needs to resort to approximative techniques, such as iterative
schemes or those based on the use of extended Lagrangians (2). In the latter approach, the dipole moments are treated as dynamic
quantities following their own “equations of motion”, and their magnitudes are computed only once during an MD timestep.

If the atomic polarizabilities are isotropic (e.g., the polarization tensor is diagonal and axx ¼ ayy ¼ azz), the induced dipole moments are parallel to the electric ﬁeld, mi ¼ aiEi. Note that the polarizability ai is now a scalar quantity. Inserting this relation into the ﬁrst term of Eq. 10 provides an alternative expression for the polarization energy,

2.1.3. Molecular Polarizability

In the parametrization and validation of a force ﬁeld, it is commonly

required to calculate polarizabilities for a set of selected molecules.

For a molecule consisting of N point dipole polarizabilities, the total polarizability is obtained by contracting the tensor B~ (see Eq. 8

above) to a 3 Â3 matrix a"mol,

Further information on the individual components of molecular polarizabilities can be obtained from ab initio calculations, and experimental Kerr effect and light scattering depolarization data (35).

2.1.4. Polarization Catastrophe

Due to the point-like character of the induced dipoles, the IPD
model has a speciﬁc problem related to dipole–dipole interactions
at small distances. For simplicity, let us consider a system of two
induced point dipoles i and j, separated by the distance r, with scalar polarizabilities ai and aj, respectively. The polarizability of the system along the line joining the dipoles ak, and perpendicular to it, a⊥, can be calculated by using Eq. 14. The resulting polarizabilities are (36)

ak ¼ ðai þ aj þ 4aiaj =r3Þ=ð1 À 4aiaj =r6Þ

(16)

and

a? ¼ ðai þ aj À 2aiaj =r3Þ=ð1 À aiaj =r6Þ:

(17)

From the denominator of Eq. 16, it can be seen that when the distance between the dipoles approaches (4aiaj)1/6, the polarizability ak goes to inﬁnity. This effect is called the polarization catastrophe. It results from the unphysically strong interaction of point dipoles aligned in the same direction (the so-called head-to-tail interaction).
There are two obvious ways of avoiding the polarization catastrophe. The ﬁrst option is to modify the polarizability tensor so that at short separations the polarizability of the point dipoles is damped to some ﬁnite value (37). The other approach is to modify the interaction tensor, so that at short separations the dipole–dipole interactions are made to correspond to those between ﬁnitesized dipoles or charge distributions, instead of point-like dipoles (35, 36).

2.1.5. Thole’s Model for Damped Interactions

9 Polarizable Force Fields 223

A damping scheme which has been adapted to several present-day polarizable force ﬁelds is the modiﬁed interaction model by Thole (36). The model employs atom interaction centers as polarizable sites with scalar polarizabilities ai. Anisotropic molecular polarizabilities then originate from the mutual interactions of the dipoles according to Eq. 3. Thole’s model avoids the polarization catastrophe by replacing the usual dipole interaction tensor, Eq. 4, by one that realistically screens the dipole–dipole interactions at short separations. By introducing a reduced distance speciﬁc for each pair of interacting dipoles,

u   r=ðaiaj Þ1=6;

(18)

the interaction tensor is rewritten as

ðT ij Þpq ¼ dpq rÀ3 À 3rprq rÀ5; ¼ ðaiaj ÞÀ1=2ðdpq uÀ3 À 3upuq uÀ5Þ; ¼ ðaiaj ÞÀ1=2t pq ðuÞ;

(19)

where the indices p and q designate cartesian coordinates, and dpq is the Kronecker delta. The shape function t of the interaction can be interpreted as the interaction tensor between two dipoles of unit polarizabilities (36).
In general, the tensor Tij assumes that the interacting dipoles are each made of two point charges that are displaced by an inﬁnitesimal distance from each other. The total interaction is then obtained from a sum of four interactions between the point charges. Thole’s model replaces the other point charge in such interactions with some well-behaved, spherically symmetric charge distribution r(u) around the atom nucleus. By doing so, the dipole–dipole interactions become screened, and the polarization catastrophe is avoided. After considering various possible charge distribution functions for t, Thole concluded that a linear and an exponential form were the most suitable ones (36). As an example, the exponential charge distribution is

rðuÞ ¼ ða3=8pÞeÀau;

(20)

where a is a characteristic damping parameter of the model. The corresponding form of the shape function is
t pq ¼ dpq =u3½1 À ða2u2=2 þ au þ 1ÞeÀau À 3uprq=r5½1 À ða3r3=6 þ a2r2=2 þ ar þ 1ÞeÀau: (21)
Thole’s original atom-based parametrizations were obtained by ﬁtting to a set of 15 experimental molecular polarizabilities (36). The results were then tested by calculating polarizabilities for molecules not included in the learning set, with the conclusion that only a single value of polarizability per element was required

224 H.S. Antila and E. Salonen

for accurate results. That is, polarizability in the Thole model is independent of the local chemical environment of the atom in question. Along with the parameter a for each charge distribution model, Thole determined the respective polarizability values for H, C, N, and O. Van Duijnen and Swart later provided an improved set of parameters by using an extended learning set of 52 molecules (38), including molecules containing F, S, Cl, Br, and I. Swart and co-workers have also presented Thole model parameters speciﬁcally optimized for amino acid residues using polarizabilities obtained with time-dependent density functional theory calculations (39). Most recently, Wang et al. presented parametrizations of the Thole model, with different charge distribution models, based on a set of 420 molecules (40, 41).

2.1.6. Practical Application of the IPD Model

The appeal of the IPD model lies mainly in the transferability of its element-based polarizabilities. Once these have been determined, it is straightforward to add the description of electronic polarization into any molecule in the force ﬁeld. On the other hand, introduction of the IPD model to most of the current MD simulation codes will require the implementation of entirely new types of interactions according to Eq. 10. Obtaining the self-consistent solution of the induced dipole moments will also require a suitably efﬁcient algorithm (42). The long-range dipole–dipole interactions will need to be taken into account with a method similar to the ones commonly used to handle point charges (see the chapter on electrostatics by Sagui et al.). Such algorithms have been developed (43–46) but not yet implemented in the most popular MD simulation packages.
As opposed to the two other models for electronic polarization introduced in this chapter, the IPD model does not require any shorter timesteps than the current non-polarizable force ﬁelds. The computational overhead related to the IPD model comes from calculating the interactions of the induced dipoles, obtaining the self-consistent solution for the dipole moments, and handling of the long-range electrostatic interactions. Depending on the choice of methodology, the computational cost of a polarizable force ﬁeld based on the IPD model is about 2–4 times that of a corresponding non-polarizable one (2, 46).

2.2. Shell Model 2.2.1. General Description

In the shell model a polarizable site is described by two charged particles, a heavy core particle and a massless or very light shell particle. The particles are connected to each other by a harmonic spring with a force constant k. The shell charge À qs (qs ! 0) and the core charge + qs are kept ﬁxed in the simulations, and polarization in the model is obtained by the displacement of the core and shell particles with respect to each other. This produces a ﬁnite-length dipole with a dipole moment

m ¼ Àqs Dr;

(22)

9 Polarizable Force Fields 225

where Dr is the displacement vector from the core to the shell particle. Self-interactions, e.g., the interactions between the core and shell particles of the same polarizable site, are not taken into account.
In molecular force ﬁelds the core particles are typically assigned to the atomic interaction centers (nuclei), and atom i thus carries a total charge of Q~ i ¼ Q i þ qs;i, where Qi is the standard atomic partial charge. In MD simulations, the core particles follow the standard equations of motion of the associated nuclei. The shell particles, in turn, can be interpreted to describe the redistributions of the valence electrons, and in dynamic simulations, they are treated either adiabatically (see section 2.2.3) or dynamically (see section 2.2.4).
The shell model is often also called the Drude oscillator model or charge-on-spring model. Historically, the former name has been used for simulations of the liquid state, while the term shell model has been mainly used in the context of simulations of solid state materials, such as ionic crystals. However, all three names have become interchangeable in the literature of biomolecular simulation.

where rij is the core–core distance between the interacting atoms. The ﬁrst term is the polarization energy, Upol, associated with separating the core and shell particles by a distance Dri. This is simply the mechanical energy of the associated harmonic spring.
The following terms in parentheses are the core–core, core–shell,
and shell–shell Coulomb interactions, respectively.

2.2.3. Adiabatic Shell Model

In the adiabatic case, the shell particles are massless, and each particle is set at its minimum energy position (zero net force) at every simulation step. The electric ﬁeld E exerts a force F E ¼ Àqs Eðr þ DrÞ on the shell particle. At mechanical equilibrium the restoring force of the core–shell harmonic spring is equal in magnitude to the force due to the electric ﬁeld

F E þ F spring ¼ 0:

(24)

With F spring ¼ ÀkDr, one obtains the relation

Dr ¼ À qs E :

(25)

226 H.S. Antila and E. Salonen

Since the displacement of a shell particle is affected by the electric ﬁelds of the other shell particles, a self-consistent solution for all the displacements is required (cf. section 2.1.1). Failing to maintain the self-consistency results in drag forces on the shell particles and simulation instability (47). The solution can be obtained through the inversion of a matrix containing the coupled shell particle displacements, given by Eq. 25, or by iteration. The former is exact and needs to be done only once, while the latter is much faster but requires, in addition to reasonable initial values of the dipole moments, sufﬁcient convergence of the iterations for stable simulations.
Comparing Eqs. 22 and 25 shows that polarization produced by the shell model is isotropic and produces dipole moments according to the linear response

Note that in order to obtain a certain value of a, it is possible to use any physically reasonable combination of qs and k. For example, the SWM4-NDP water model by Lamoureux et al. (29) has qs ¼ À1:71636e and k ¼ 4. 184 Â105 kJ/nm2 on a single polarizable site set at the oxygen atom. These parameter choices result in a/4pE0 ¼ 0. 97825 Â10À3 nm3. This is signiﬁcantly lower than the experimental gas-phase value of a/4pE0 ¼ 1.45 Â 10À3 nm3 (34). The SWM4-NDP water model and other molecule parametriza-
tions in the same CHARMM framework are based on reproducing
the dielectric constants of pure liquids, while treating the molecular
polarizabilities as free parameters (7). For this force ﬁeld, empiri-
cally determined scaling factors for the gas-phase polarizabilities
range from 0.7 to 1.0, depending on the molecule type. This
approach has been justiﬁed by QM calculations of pure liquids
and small solutes therein (48, 49) which have yielded lower values
of molecular polarizabilities in solution than in the gas phase.

2.2.4. Dynamic Shell Model

In the dynamic case, parts of the atomic masses, typically of the order of 0.1–1 amu, are assigned to the respective shell particles, which then follow their own equations of motion. This is a type of an extended Lagrangian approach similar to the ones mentioned in 2.1.1. To prevent the shell particle thermalization, which would decrease the accuracy of the simulations and even result in simulation instabilities (47), the shell particles are coupled to a low-temperature ($ 1 K) thermostat of their own. The advantage of this scheme is in avoiding the time-consuming calculations for self-consistent solutions of the

9 Polarizable Force Fields 227

shell particle displacements. However, the low masses of the shell particles necessitate the use of short timesteps for integrating the equations of motion ( $ 0.5–1 fs) in order to guarantee the accuracy and stability of the simulations.
In the adiabatic case the polarizability of a shell model site was obtained by assuming mechanical equilibrium for the core–shell pair (cf. 2.2.3). In order to derive a similar expression for the dynamic case, we ﬁrst recall that the polarizability of a shell model site is isotropic. Assuming that variations in the total electric ﬁeld are small enough at length scales comparable to the sizes of the core–shell dipoles, the related polarization energy is given by Eq. 13. Equating this with the general expression for the shell model polarization energy (the ﬁrst term in Eq. 23) gives

kDr2 ¼ m2 :

(28)

a

Inserting the expression for the dipole moment in Eq. 22, we

recover the expression for the polarizability of a shell model site

in the adiabatic case, Eq. 27.

2.2.5. Steric and Dispersion Interactions

The interaction center for the steric and dispersion interactions, modelled commonly with the 12–6 Lennard-Jones potential, is usually set at the shell particle. The physical reasoning here is that interatomic repulsion (exchange) and dispersion interactions can be mainly associated with the valence electrons. The repulsive interactions, modelled by the rÀ12 part of the Lennard-Jones potential, prevent the polarizable atoms from coming arbitrarily close to each other. In most cases this is sufﬁcient to avoid the polarization catastrophe (see 2.1.4). However, as demonstrated by Yu et al. (50), in the case of highly polarizable atoms or polyvalent ions, additional means are required to ensure the stability of the simulation. One option is to use an additional anharmonic interaction at high enough core–shell separations (50),

U hyp ¼ khypðDr À DrcutÞ4;

(29)

where khyp is a force constant and Drcut is a cutoff distance beyond which the additional restoring force is applied. Another method to ensure the stability of the simulations is to assign a small repulsive potential also to the core particle. A third option is to use some kind of a damping scheme, like the one introduced in section 2.1.5. That is, to replace point charge interactions at short separations with those between point charges and smooth charge distributions. This approach is used in the polarizable CHARMM force ﬁeld based on the shell model (50, 51).

2.2.6. Practical Application of the Shell Model

Electrostatic energy in the shell model is solely based on interactions between point charges, and no special interactions (aside from the harmonic springs connecting the core–shell pairs) need to be

228 H.S. Antila and E. Salonen

introduced into the existing simulation codes. Consequently, the shell model has already been implemented in many commonly used MD packages, such as GROMACS, CHARMM, and GROMOS.
On the other hand, for each polarizable site, the method introduces twice the amount of charged particles. This translates to four times as many Coulomb interactions as in a non-polarizable force ﬁeld (as interactions between the core and shell particles of the same polarizable site are not taken into account). Moreover, in fully dynamic shell model simulations, a small timestep ( $ 0.5–1 fs) needs to be used due to the light shell particles. Part of this extra computational cost could be overcome by multi-timestep methods treating the motion of the shell particles and atomic nuclei at separate timescales.
As opposed to the IPD model, which uses highly transferable element-based parameters, the shell model parameters ki and qi for each polarizable site are not necessarily transferable between different molecular moieties. For each new molecule included in the force ﬁeld library, the polarization parameters need to be carefully optimized in order to reproduce, for instance, the correct molecular polarizabilities and electrostatic properties. To this end, the developers of the polarizable CHARMM force ﬁeld have published comprehensive procedures for parametrizing molecules for the shell model (51–53).

2.3. Fluctuating Charge Model
2.3.1. General Description

The third commonly used model for describing polarization in MM

force ﬁelds is the FQ model. This model is also often called the

electronegativity equalization model (see 2.3.2 below). The FQ

model does not employ induced dipoles like the IPD or shell

models. Instead, the values of atomic partial charges, which are

ﬁxed in non-polarizable force ﬁelds, are made dynamic quantities.

In this way the model produces molecular polarizability to all

orders in the charge moments. In addition, the FQ model allows

intra- and intermolecular charge transfer, as opposed to the IPD

and shell models.

The instantaneous values of the partial charges are found at

each timestep by minimizing the electrostatic energy of the system.

For simplicity, let us ﬁrst consider the case of a single atom. The

energy required to create a charge Q on a neutral atom can be

expressed as a truncated second-order Taylor series,

where U 0 ¼ U(0) is a constant. The partial derivatives of energy in

the series have clear physical interpretations. Taking a neutral atom

as the reference state and assuming that the truncated Taylor series

of Eq. 30 is valid in the range Q ¼ Æ e, the ionization potential (IP) of the atom is IP ¼ U ðþeÞ À U ð0Þ. In turn, the electron afﬁnity

which is the atomic hardness, e.g., resistance to the ﬂow of electrons (55). The atom-speciﬁc values of electronegativity w0 and atomic hardness Z0 can either be determined from experimental data or ab

initio calculations (56, 57). However, since these quantities are used

in empirical force ﬁelds, they are often treated simply as adjustable

parameters. The aim is that the optimized parameters would be

speciﬁc to small functional groups commonly found in biomolecules

and hence transferable between different molecules in the force ﬁeld (58). This kind of an approach is similar to the ﬁtting of the rÀ6

dispersion term coefﬁcients in Lennard-Jones potentials: while in

theory the Lennard-Jones coefﬁcients are related to atomic polariz-

abilities, in most MM force ﬁelds, they are taken as empirical para-

meters in order to reproduce the desired condensed-phase properties.

For a system of N atoms, the total electrostatic energy expres-

sion, replacing the usual summation over Coulomb interactions in

non-polarizable force ﬁelds ( / QiQj/rij), is

where the coupling terms  ij depend on the distance between the interacting atoms i and j, and  ii(0) ¼  i0. Note that in order to simplify the expression for the total energy, the charges are now given in units of e (cf. Eqs. 31 and 32).

The instantaneous atomic partial charges are obtained by minimizing

Eq. 33 with respect to the charges, with the boundary condition that

the net charge of the system (or parts thereof, see 2.3.4), Q tot ¼ ∑iQ i, is conserved. The boundary condition can be imposed by using a Lagrange multiplier (2),

Recalling the deﬁnition of the Mulliken electronegativity, Eq. 31,

we notice that minimizing the electrostatic energy leads equaliza-

tion of the atomic electronegativities. Hence, the FQ model is often

also called the method of electronegativity equalization. It should

be noted that the electronegativities in molecules are not the same

This set of coupled linear equations requires a self-consistent solution. As with the two previous models, the self-consistency can be obtained through matrix inversion, iteration, or by using an extended Lagrangian where the partial charges follow their own “equations of motion” with ﬁctitious masses mQ. As in the case of the shell model (cf. see section 2.2.4), thermostating of the charges to a very low temperature ( $ 1 K) provides an acceptable separation of the charge and nuclear degrees of freedom and stable simulation trajectories (59).

2.3.3. Coupling Terms  ij

The physical meaning of the coupling terms  ij in Eq. 33 is that they represent Coulomb interactions between the atoms. At long

enough separations,  ij should thus give the usual expression for Coulombic interactions between point charges,  ij ¼ ð8pE0rij ÞÀ1. (Note the extra factor of 1/2 which comes from avoiding double

counting of the interaction energies in Eq. 36). At short separa-

tions, where the atom-centered charge distributions overlap, a

physically plausible approach is to replace the point charge interac-

tions with those between charge distributions r(r) (2),

The charge distributions used can be either spherical or elongated. One option is to use atom-centered Slater-type orbitals (56),

(39)

where A is a normalization constant, n the principal quantum number, and z a screening exponent. A computationally more efﬁcient alternative to the Coulomb interaction integrals in Eq. 38 is to use some kind of an empirical combining rule for  ij.

Note that for sufﬁcient large interatomic distances rij ( $ 0.25 nm (59)), the screened interaction term of Eq. 40 ﬁnds the Coulomb form / 1/rij. The values of  ij can be ﬁtted to many-body energies of small molecular clusters and molecular dipole moments, electrostatic potential, and polarizabilities. In reference to the latter, the relation between the molecular dipole polarizability and atomic hardness tensors is (59)

a ¼ DrhÀ1DrT;

(41)

where Dr represents the positions of atoms with respect to the center of geometry.

2.3.4. Restrictions on the Flow of Charge

Equation (33) gives the total electrostatic energy for a system of N atoms. This expression allows completely free ﬂow of charge throughout the system. While charge transfer effects can be important in quantum-mechanical description of molecular systems (see the chapter by Groenhof on QM/MM methods), in the FQ model, a completely unrestricted electronegativity equalization leads to unrealistically high transfer of charge over long distances (2, 61). This results in overestimation of polarizabilities and molecular dipole moments and is especially problematic for macromolecules such as proteins and DNA. Thus, in practical applications of the FQ model, the redistribution of charge is allowed only within each molecule, or even just certain parts of molecules. The boundary conditions used for the electronegativity equalization, Eq. 36, are the conservation of the net charge of each molecule (or molecule fragment). As an example, the FQ model of the DMPC phospholipid by Davis et al. (18) allows electronegativity equalization only within small fragments of 5–7 heavy atoms, corresponding to small compounds used for parametrizing the force ﬁeld.
The ﬂow of charge can also be regulated by having atom-pairspeciﬁc hardness values, as is done in the bond-charge increment (BCI) (58) and atom–atom charge transfer (AACT) (61) models. In this way charge transfer can even be restricted only to atoms covalently bonded to each other.

2.3.5. Practical Application of the FQ Model

The FQ model has some practical advantages over the two previous models covered in this chapter. It does not entail any new types of interactions (cf. the IPD model) nor does it increase the number of charge–charge interactions (cf. the shell model). If the partial charge degrees of freedom are treated with an extended Lagrangian

232 H.S. Antila and E. Salonen

scheme, there is only a small computational overhead associated with the dynamics and potential energy minimization with respect to the charges (of the order of 10%) (18, 26, 59). However, the continuously changing values of atomic partial charges necessitate the use of short timesteps in MD simulations. On the one hand, the ﬁctitious charge masses mQ in the extended Lagrangian approach need to be small enough so that the charges adapt promptly to changes in their environment. On the other hand, the charge masses should be large enough to allow the use of a reasonably large simulation timestep. In practice, atomistic simulations employing the FQ model are limited to timesteps of $0.5–1 fs (26, 59), though the simulation times could be reduced with multi-timestep algorithms.
In addition to the computational overhead and practical issues related to restricting the ﬂow of charge, there are certain wellknown physical issues related to the FQ model. Since the atomic polarization response by the changing values of the partial charges is isotropic, there is no out-of-plane polarization for planar or linear molecular moieties. This leads to problems, e.g., when simulating charged groups above aromatic rings. Due to the same reason, the FQ model yields too low energies for bifurcated hydrogen bonds (11, 62). These issues can be ﬁxed by combining the FQ polarization model with another one, as is done for instance in the hybrid IPD/FQ model by Stern and co-workers (11).

2.4. Other Methods for Modelling Electronic Polarization

In addition to the polarization models introduced in sections 2.1–2.3, we brieﬂy mention here a few other methods for including polarization effects in molecular simulations. Naturally, the most accurate way to model electronic polarization in atoms and molecules is by quantum-mechanical methods. However, the high computational cost inhibits the applicability of the full QM approach, and hence, one has to resort to more approximative methods. One option is to use hybrid QM/MM methods introduced in the chapter by Groenhof. In QM/MM, only a small subregion of the system, such as one comprised by a ligand and the active site of a protein (63), is treated quantum-mechanically. The rest of the system is modelled using a classical MM force ﬁeld. The accuracy of the electronic polarizability in the QM part will depend on the chosen level of theory. For the rest of the system, polarization can be included either implicitly or explicitly, e.g., by using one of the methods introduced above. Another option for including QM effects into the computationally efﬁcient force ﬁeld simulations is to base the molecular interaction terms on electronstructure calculations, as is done in the X-Pol force ﬁeld by Gao and co-workers (64, 65, 66). In this method, electronic polarization is included in the force ﬁeld by calculating the instantaneous values of atomic partial charges from the molecular wave functions.

9 Polarizable Force Fields 233
In the continuum dielectric approach, a molecule is depicted at the atomic level and the solvent or environment as a continuum medium characterized by a dielectric constant (3, 6, 67). Examples of this type of an approach are the studies by Schnieders et al. (68, 69), where the atomistic AMOEBA force ﬁeld was combined with a continuum solvent. A further simpliﬁcation of the continuum dielectric approach was recently presented by Tan et al. (70, 71). In their model both the solute and solvent are treated at the continuum level, the only difference between them being their dielectric constant values, while polarization is included as a density of induced dipole moments. The Langevin dipole (LD) solvation model is an intermediate between the continuum and discrete approaches (9). In the LD model the use of the dielectric constant is avoided, but a detailed description of solvent molecules is also omitted. The solvent is approximated by polarizable point dipoles ﬁxed on a cubic grid, and the dipoles reorient according to a Langevin-type equation.

3. Biomolecular Simulations Based on Polarizable Force Fields

Although atomistic simulations employing polarizable force ﬁelds have thus far mainly focused on water, ions, and simple organic liquids (see the review articles (2, 6, 7)), there has been a steady progress in the methodological development toward comprehensive biomolecular force ﬁelds. We provide here some highlights of biomolecular simulation studies employing the polarizable force ﬁeld methodologies presented in this chapter.

3.1. Peptides and Proteins
3.1.1. N-Methylacetamide

N-Methylacetamide (NMA) is a small molecule analog of the peptide backbone of proteins which has been used as a starting point for parametrizing comprehensive polarizable protein force ﬁelds. Cieplak et al. showed that taking electronic polarization explicitly into account with the IPD model produces NMA-water hydrogen bonding free energies in a better agreement with ab initio calculations than a non-polarizable model (72). The FQ model of NMA by Rick and Berne accurately reproduced the changes in gas-phase charge distributions arising from conformational changes and functional group substitution (73). Calculations carried out with a dielectric continuum solvent also reproduced the aqueous-phase charge distributions and free energies of solvation.
Several parametrizations of NMA based on the shell model (51) were recently developed for the polarizable CHARMM force ﬁeld by MacKerell and co-workers. The best agreement with experimental data was obtained with the parameter set which most accurately reproduced the ab initio gas-phase values for the dipole polarizability

234 H.S. Antila and E. Salonen

tensor elements. In contrast to the additive CHARMM force ﬁeld, the polarizable models of NMA accurately reproduced its bulk liquid properties, including the anomalously high relative permittivity.
Xie et al. presented parametrizations of NMA, other amides, and liquid alkanes for an IPD-model-based variant of CHARMM22 called PIPF-CHARMM (74). In addition to providing a good description of bulk liquid properties, detailed parametrizations of the conformational energetics of NMA and alanine dipeptide were concluded to be an encouraging starting point for a complete force ﬁeld for proteins.

3.1.2. AMBER ff02rl

Wang and co-workers optimized peptide backbone dihedrals (75) for the AMBER ff02 force ﬁeld (72), which employs the IPD model for electronic polarization. Alanine dipeptide was used as a model system of the parameter ﬁtting for the new AMBER ff02.rl force ﬁeld. The dipeptide as well as a longer Ace-(Ala)7-Nme peptide were simulated in water. Conformational distributions of the peptides were concluded to be in agreement with experiments.

3.1.3. OPLS/PFF

Since the late 1990s, Friesner, Berne, and co-workers have worked on constructing a comprehensive force ﬁeld for proteins (5). The ﬁrst studies focused on parametrizing FQ (58) and hybrid FQ/IPD (11) models for small peptides. Transferability of the parametrizations to other peptides was demonstrated, and calculations of gas-phase conformational energies of these molecules showed clear improvement with respect to the non-polarizable OPLS-AA force ﬁeld.
The ﬁrst comprehensive version of the polarizable protein force ﬁeld, named OPLS/PFF, was presented in 2002 (76). The parametrization of the nonbonded interactions were primarily based on gas-phase ab initio calculations. For the most part, the bonded energy terms were adapted from the OPLS-AA force ﬁeld, but key torsional terms for the amino acid residues were reparametrized. The force ﬁeld was tested with energy minimization and short MD studies in vacuum. The results showed accuracy comparable to OPLS-AA, but the authors noted that a proper validation of the force ﬁeld required more realistic simulations of proteins in solvation. The force ﬁeld was subsequently employed in explicit solvent simulations of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) (45). OPLS/PFF was demonstrated to retain the native structure of the protein as accurately as OPLS-AA. However, a more detailed analysis showed noticeable differences between the polarizable and non-polarizable force ﬁeld simulations, especially in hydrogen bonding patterns and structural and dynamic properties of water around the protein (77).
The second version of OPLS/PFF (67) included more extensive parametrizations of small organic molecules and an accompanying continuum solvent model, which was ﬁt to reproduce free energy of solvation data for a large set of molecules. The test simulations

3.1.4. FQ CHARMM Force Field
3.2. Lipids

9 Polarizable Force Fields 235
included structure optimizations of proteins and protein-ligand complexes, with reasonable agreement to experimental structure data. The importance of accounting for electronic polarizability in pKa shift calculations was demonstrated in the case of carboxylic residues of the turkey ovomucoid third domain protein (78).
In 2004, Patel et al. presented an FQ polarizable force ﬁeld for proteins based on the additive CHARMM22 force ﬁeld (59, 79). Protein structures obtained with gas-phase energy minimizations as well as short dynamic simulations in vacuum were shown to be comparable to those produced by OPLS/PFF (76). More importantly, condensed-phase MD simulations of six small proteins in solvation resulted in root-mean-square deviations of 1–2.5 A˚ from the native structures, in line with the accuracy of CHARMM22. The protein force ﬁeld was later used by the Patel group in studies of a membrane ion channel (19, 80) (see below).
As discussed in section 1.2, lipid bilayers represent systems whose simulation is likely to beneﬁt a great deal from polarizable models. Although there are several well-established additive force ﬁelds for lipids, the ﬁrst polarizable models were introduced only very recently. Harder et al. employed the shell model CHARMM force ﬁeld to study DPPC lipid monolayers at an air–water interface. They showed that only by using a polarizable model, a good agreement with the experimentally determined interfacial dipole potential could be obtained (20). In a similar fashion, Vorobyov and Allen studied the effect of explicit electronic polarization on the interfacial potential of a DPPC lipid bilayer membrane (81). In this case, the lipid model was based on the CHARMM27 additive force ﬁeld, with only the lipid hydrocarbon tails chosen as shell model sites. In reference to the non-polarizable force ﬁeld, a reduced membrane dipole potential was obtained, in line with experiments. The polarizable DPPC model was also used by the same group to study the partitioning of arginine side chain analogs in a DPPC membrane (82), and the effect of membrane deformation on the permeation energetics of a charged arginine analog (83).
Davis et al. have recently simulated lipid bilayer membranes by using FQ models based on CHARMM27 (18, 19). The polarizable models of the DMPC and DPPC lipids produced structural properties of the membranes similar to those obtained with CHARMM27. A noticeable difference between the force ﬁelds, though, was a more pronounced permeation of water into the membrane in the case of the polarizable model. This was attributed to the weaker dipole moments of water molecules deeper in the membrane, resulting in a decreased free energy cost of permeating the membrane. Interestingly, in contrast to the study by Vorobyov and Allen (81), in this case, the use of a polarizable force ﬁeld resulted in a small increase of the membrane dipole potential.

236 H.S. Antila and E. Salonen

The FQ force ﬁeld, named CHEQ by the authors, was further used
to study the stability of the ion channel gramicidin A in a DMPC bilayer (19) and K+ ion permeation through the channel (80).

3.3. Nucleic Acids

Baucom et al. used MD simulations to study a DNA decamer crystal with different versions of the AMBER force ﬁeld (84), including the polarizable ff02 parametrization. Although all the AMBER variants tested performed reasonably well on a 25 ns timescale, the polarizable models of DNA and water provided the best agreement with experimental data. In a follow-up study (25), the authors showed that AMBER ff02 reproduced sequencespeciﬁc effects in the same DNA decamer better than the nonpolarizable AMBER ff99 force ﬁeld. With a simulation set-up corresponding to the unit cell environment, the ideal DNA B form was shown to converge toward the appropriate crystallographic structure. The AMBER ff02 force ﬁeld was also used by Vladimirov et al. (85) to calculate solvent reorganization energies of electron transfer in A-DNA, B-DNA, and rhodamine 6G-DNA complexes, showing a reduction of $30% from the energies obtained with the AMBER ff99 force ﬁeld.
In 2005, Anisimov et al. carried out the ﬁrst polarizable CHARMM force ﬁeld nucleic acid simulations (52). Base-base and model compound-water interactions of the shell model parametrization were generally shown to be comparable in accuracy to those of the non-polarizable CHARMM27 force ﬁeld. However, a 1- ns simulation study of a DNA octamer in an aqueous environment with sodium counterions showed noticeable differences to the CHARMM27 force ﬁeld, and the structure steadily deviated from that of the DNA B form. An improved parametrization of the polarizable nucleic acid bases was recently introduced (86). The representation of electrostatics in the new model was signiﬁcantly improved with respect to the CHARMM27 force ﬁeld. The heats of sublimation of the bases were also better reproduced than with the additive model, though at a small expense of accuracy in molecular volumes and gas-phase binding enthalpies of the bases.

4. Outlook

Considering the importance of polarization effects, it is actually quite surprising to note for how long non-polarizable force ﬁelds have been the most popular tools in the computational study of biomolecular systems. While non-polarizable force ﬁelds employing ﬁxed partial charges do feature both orientational and geometric polarization (cf. 1.1), an energetic contribution as important as electronic polarization cannot be overlooked in any force ﬁeld that aims to produce realistic descriptions of nonbonded

9 Polarizable Force Fields 237
interactions in molecular systems. Moreover, the adaptivity of polarizable force ﬁelds is likely to improve both the general accuracy and transferability of the next-generation force ﬁelds.
For polarizable force ﬁelds to become widely used tools in the future, the associated special interactions and algorithms need to be implemented to the molecular simulation software in an efﬁcient way. Replacing the electrostatic interactions solely based on ﬁxed point charges by one of the non-additive descriptions of electronic polarization further entails a complete reoptimization of the existing non-polarizable force ﬁeld parameters. Since it has taken nearly four decades for the non-polarizable force ﬁelds to reach the present state of accuracy, this is not a trivial task. On the other hand, entirely new MM force ﬁelds featuring explicit descriptions of electronic polarization from the ﬁrst version onward are being developed. The AMOEBA force ﬁeld (32, 33) is an example of this new generation of force ﬁelds. Although AMOEBA is based on a similar total potential energy expression as the current nonpolarizable force ﬁelds, it further features a multipole representation of the ﬁxed charges in molecules and the IPD model for electronic polarization.
As opposed to the implementation and parametrization of polarizable force ﬁelds, their computational cost is hardly an issue anymore. Novel algorithms for treating the degrees of freedom associated with electronic polarization make such simulations only about 2–4 times slower than the ones carried out with nonpolarizable force ﬁelds. More efﬁcient implementations, decreasing the computational overhead as low as a factor of 1.2–1.3, have also been realized (45, 87). Depending on the application, a trade-off between a reduction in the simulation timescale and the potential gain in accuracy associated with polarizable models seems quite appealing. With the advent of GPU-based computing, which is especially suited for the intensive calculations related to the methods introduced in this chapter, we anticipate a signiﬁcant increase in the performance of polarizable force ﬁelds in the near future.
