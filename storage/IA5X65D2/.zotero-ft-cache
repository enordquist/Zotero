Abstract
Hydrophobicity manifests itself differently on large and small length scales. This review focuses on large-length-scale hydrophobicity, particularly on dewetting at single hydrophobic surfaces and drying in regions bounded on two or more sides by hydrophobic surfaces. We review applicable theories, simulations, and experiments pertaining to large-scale hydrophobicity in physical and biomolecular systems and clarify some of the critical issues pertaining to this subject. Given space constraints, we cannot review all the signiﬁcant and interesting work in this active ﬁeld.

1. INTRODUCTION
Hydrophobicity seems to be required for sustainable life as we know it. It gives rise to unusual properties of aqueous solutions of nonpolar solutes and plays an important role in a wide variety of chemical phenomena, such as protein folding (1–4), the self-assembly of amphiphiles into micelles and membranes (5, 6), and the gating of ion channels (7, 8). Hydrophobicity lies at the heart of so many important chemical and biophysical phenomena that investigators have devoted considerable effort to understanding it over the past ﬁve decades. Tanford (9) gives a short and provocative history of how this concept gained common acceptance in the biochemical community. Recent reviews on various aspects of hydrophobicity have been published in this series (10, 11) and elsewhere (12–14).
Many controversies have arisen in attempts to ﬁnd a generally satisfactory theory of hydrophobicity. Ball’s (14) recent review provides a fascinating and measured historical discussion of the contentious issues along with modern developments and how they ﬁt in with other general questions about the role of water in biological systems. Many controversies involve quantitative questions that cannot be resolved by taking a rigid and simplistic view based on generally useful qualitative concepts, whether of broken hydrogen bonds, dry interfaces, or hydrogen-bond networks. Experience has shown that water is a subtle and ﬂexible medium with a ﬂuctuating and elusive balance between many nearly degenerate local conﬁgurations. This allows it to respond in surprising ways to different perturbations, and we must be equally ﬂexible in our attempts to understand its solvation properties.
However, there does appear to be a convergence of views on certain general features of hydrophobicity involving a dependence on length scale in which qualitative pictures have proven useful. This provides a conceptual framework within which we can place our present understanding and can highlight the remaining unresolved issues. We believe that most of the remaining controversy is not so much about the physical phenomena themselves (as uncovered by experiment and careful simulations) as it is about the language used and the limitations and oversimpliﬁcations found in all current theoretical models. It is timely therefore to attempt a review of the experimental and theoretical studies leading to an emerging consensus in this speciﬁc area.
It is now generally recognized that hydrophobicity manifests itself differently on small and large length scales (15–24). For example, in the hydrophobic hydration of small hydrophobic molecules (such as argon or methane), the molecules can ﬁt into the water hydrogen-bond network without destroying any hydrogen bonds (15). Because no hydrogen bonds are broken, the enthalpy of solution ( H ) is small. The formation of small cavities in the solvent to accommodate the solute is an entropically dominated process, and the presence of the solute constrains the orientational and translational degrees of freedom of the neighboring water molecules. Thus the standard entropy of solvation ( S ) for argon is negative [e.g., SA◦r = −30.2 cal (mol K)−1] and is proportional to the molar excluded volume of the solute. This means that the free energy of solution ( G) is positive and increases both with temperature (around biological temperatures) and with the excluded volume of the solute, and the dissolution of small apolar solutes is entropically driven.
The conventional view of the hydrophobic interaction in this small-scale regime is based on a simple picture proposed by Frank & Evans (25). Small molecules are accommodated by water locally forming more ordered ice-like or clathrate-like cages with strong and relatively rigid hydrogen bonds around each molecule. Because two or more apolar molecules in contact order fewer solvent molecules than when they are apart, the entropy change when solute molecules are brought together should be positive and should thereby lower the free energy of the solution. Small enthalpy changes are ignored in this argument.

ANRV373-PC60-05 ARI 25 February 2009 16:8
It is now recognized that this view is overly simplistic. In particular, the hydrogen-bond structure is sufﬁciently ﬂexible that there are still considerable ﬂuctuations in the adjacent solvent shells (14). Simulations (26–28) and theory (29) showed that two inert gas particles would not be driven together to form a dimer, but the solvent-separated pair would be a more likely state than the contact pair. The physical reasons for the theory’s success were somewhat unclear in the original formulation (29). We can ﬁnd a deeper understanding in more recent work (30, 31) that exploits the Gaussian nature of density ﬂuctuations in the pure bulk solvent. This can be used to determine the probability of ﬁnding small cavities in the solvent that can accommodate the solute molecules. This approach is successful in predicting the thermodynamics of hydration of small hard spheres (HSs) and provides a quantitative understanding of hydrophobicity in this regime (10).
In contrast, as suggested by Stillinger (15) and conﬁrmed by molecular dynamics simulations (32), large strongly hydrophobic solutes behave differently. When inserted into water, they must break some hydrogen bonds at the interface. One hydroxyl group of each interfacial water molecule tends to point into the hydrophobic surface, so the orientational ordering of water molecules at the solute-liquid interface resembles the ordering at a liquid-vapor interface. The missing interfacial hydrogen bonds give rise to a large positive enthalpy of solvation and correspondingly to a free energy change that is proportional to the solute’s surface area, A, as opposed to being proportional to volume for small hydrophobes. (The pressure under most relevant conditions is small enough that the bulk p – V term generally can be neglected until a solute reaches truly macroscopic size.) Stillinger argued that if the solute-water attraction is sufﬁciently weak, a large smooth hydrophobic solute might “be immediately surrounded by a microscopically thin ﬁlm of water vapor,” and its hydration free energy would then be dominated by a term such as γlv A, where γlv is the vapor-liquid surface tension.
Thus the hydrophobic interaction of large-scale hydrophobic solutes is different than smallscale ones. Fewer water hydrogen bonds will have to be broken when two large hydrophobes are in contact than when they are apart, so there is a negative enthalpy change when two or more such solutes are brought into contact from larger separations. Because the free energy change is dominated by the enthalpy change, it too will be negative, and there will be a thermodynamic driving force toward aggregation. Thus small-scale hydrophobicity is entropically driven, but large-scale hydrophobicity is expected to be enthalpically driven.
The suggestion that the interface between a large hydrophobic solute and water could resemble a liquid-vapor interface has generated much controversy (10, 12, 14, 33–37). Certainly, there are some clear differences. A free liquid-vapor interface has long-wavelength capillary-wave ﬂuctuations (38) that would be geometrically inhibited (damped out) at such a solute-water interface (e.g., see 39), but these do not change the local interface structure (40). More importantly, even weak van der Waals attractions between the solute and bulk water (always present in realistic cases) would suppress the formation of a macroscopic vapor region (24, 33, 36, 41). Moreover, it is not so clear what is meant by a microscopic vapor layer or what its thickness should be (34). Ball (14) has reviewed experimental evidence for the existence and width of this presumed vapor layer, concluding that, although many experiments (42–47) differ in some details and interpretation, there seems to be an emerging consensus that the depletion layer, when it exists, is only of molecular size (14). However, it still seems plausible that water molecules at the interface would tend to point one OH bond into the solute to better maintain other hydrogen bonds in much the same way and for the same reasons that the OH bonds of water point into the vapor region in a free water-vapor interface.
As discussed below, both experiments (42, 44–46, 48–52) and simulations (22, 53–62) suggest that the similar arrangements and dynamical behavior of these partially ordered but ﬂuctuating interfacial OH bonds best characterize the analogy between the liquid-vapor and large hydrophobic

interfaces in water and distinguish them from hydrophilic interfaces. Hydrophilic solutes with strong localized attractive interactions with water, especially those arising from locally charged or polar groups, will strongly perturb and perhaps pin some interfacial OH groups in different bonding conﬁgurations, thus suppressing local ﬂuctuations (63).
An important effect not appreciated until fairly recently (19, 20, 64, 65) is that when two largescale strongly hydrophobic particles approach each other closer than a critical separation, there can be a large-scale drying (or dewetting) transition in which the interparticle region, although large enough to accommodate water molecules, desolvates, leading to hydrophobic collapse. As discussed below, this behavior can be correlated with the contact angle of water droplets on macroscopic hydrophobic surfaces (64–69). However, even in idealized models, the critical separation is a decreasing function of the strength of the attractive interaction between the solute and water and disappears entirely for small solutes. We review recent simulation results, examining the possible relevance of such macroscopic dewetting transitions in the folding of heterogeneous globular proteins (68–79), the collapse of multidomain proteins, and so on. In such heterogeneous dynamical environments, there is a sensitive coupling of hydrophobicity to changes in local geometry, dispersion, and electrostatic and electric ﬁeld effects (80–85), and simulations presently offer the best method to help understand the ﬁnal balance.
This review focuses on large-scale hydrophobicity, that is hydrophobicity resulting from the interaction between mostly apolar mesoscopic structures (such as large molecules or assemblies of small molecules) and mesoscopic enclosed spaces (such as the ones that may exist in protein active sites, protein cavities, nanotubes, or inside nanoparticles such as C180). Owing to space limitations, a complete review of all recent work on this important subject is not possible, so we only list a few representative examples, some from our own work, to illustrate recent advances on large-scale hydrophobicity and dewetting.
2. THEORY
In this section we focus on theories describing the length-scale dependence of hydrophobic interactions and in particular the role of interfaces in large-scale hydrophobicity. For the special case of a liquid in a state very near liquid-vapor coexistence next to a hard wall, one can establish quite generally that a vapor-like layer must form near the wall. This drying arises from generic features of the liquid-vapor interface and the hard wall and applies equally well to liquid water, liquid argon, and other liquids. Because of the short-range impulsive nature of the interaction between the hard wall and the ﬂuid, the pressure is exactly related to the contact density at the wall (86) by the same expression that applies for an ideal gas at that same density and temperature: P/kB T = ρ(0). If the bulk liquid is very near coexistence, its pressure must be low and close to that of the equilibrium liquid-vapor system.
Because the vapor is well approximated by an ideal gas away from the critical point, it follows from the contact theorem above that the density near the wall must be much lower than that of the bulk liquid and close to that of the vapor phase at coexistence. More detailed arguments show that complete drying with the formation of a macroscopic vapor layer will occur as the system approaches two-phase coexistence (87).
However, these simple results apply only for a true hard wall, and as mentioned above, predictions about the vapor layer’s thickness would be affected strongly by the presence of even weak attractive interactions between the wall and adjacent ﬂuid. Complete drying or even the formation of a vapor layer of any signiﬁcant extent at a single interface is hardly ever relevant in practice. However, the existence of this fundamental drying limit and the idea that vapor-like interfaces could play an important role at least for idealized large hydrophobic solutes seem well established.

Indeed, the analogy between the behavior of water near an extended hydrophobic region and the liquid-vapor interface is even stronger than these generic arguments might suggest. In water there are strong hydrogen-bond forces favoring an interface with a single broken hydrogen bond both for the liquid-vapor interface and near a large hydrophobic region. These local structural features, based on speciﬁc network properties of water, set an energy scale on the order of the hydrogenbond energy and are likely to persist even in the presence of weak solute-solvent attractions, unlike other properties of a generic liquid-vapor interface, such as the interface width. This greatly extends the utility of the analogy and offers at least the possibility that it could still be useful for more realistic solutes and in certain heterogeneous environments. The extent of a depletion layer is a quantitative question that some microscopic theories discussed below could address.

2.1. Macroscopic Approach

We now turn to the large-scale drying that can sometimes occur between two large hydrophobic particles as a function of separation. A slight generalization of a simple macroscopic thermodynamic model (64–66, 88, 89) based on Young’s equation (90) provides a context for understanding some of the key features. The model considers the change in the grand potential (D) for the reaction in which the interplate region (the gap) between two ﬁxed macroscopic coaxial cylindrical plates p, with separation D, goes from being completely wet to dry, p[Wet] p → p[Dry] p, with the vapor occupying the gap. (This is a simplifying assumption. In reality the vapor cavity is not cylindrical but resembles an hourglass deﬁned in part by the contact angle, and this simple back-of-the-envelope approach overestimates the critical distance.)
Ignoring edge effects, the change in the grand potential for this reaction is (D) = [(P − Pv) Aw + γlvCw](D − Dc ), where Dc is the critical separation below which vapor between the disks is stable1:

Dc = 2 γ /[(P − Pv) + 2γlv/Rm].

(1)

Here γ ≡ γsl − γs v = −γlv cos θc is Young’s equation, where θc is the contact angle for the liquid
in contact with the wall of the plate, and γlv, γs v, and γsl are the liquid-vapor, solid-vapor, and solid-liquid surface tensions, respectively. Aw = π Rm2 is the area of the plate face; Cw = 2π Rm is the circumference of the cylindrical plate; P is the pressure on the liquid; and Pv is the pressure
of the vapor between the plates. For a hydrophobic surface, the contact angle is obtuse so that

γ > 0 and Dc > 0, and drying should occur. However, for hydrophilic plates the contact angle is acute, so is positive for all separations, and the interplate region is wet.

For small plate sizes (small Rm), the P − Pv term usually can be neglected compared with the surface tension term, and then Dc = −Rm cos θc should grow linearly with plate radius; however, for sufﬁciently large plates, the surface tension term in the denominator can be neglected, Dc should become independent of plate size, and drying should occur for very large separations,

Dc = 2 γ /(P − Pv). Because the contact angle is a decreasing function of the strength of the plate-water attractive

interaction, the critical distance for drying decreases as the strength of the attraction increases. From this, we expect that purely repulsive plates will be the most prone to drying,2 and substances

1For two different hydrophobic surfaces, 2 γ → 2 ¯ γ , where ¯ γ is the equal weight average of the γ of each surface, a quantity equal to γlv times the average of each surface’s cos θc . Thus if one surface has a much smaller contact angle than the other, the critical distance is much smaller for this enclosure. 2For a hard wall θc = 180◦ and from Young’s equation, we ﬁnd that γsl = γs v + γlv , indicating that the interface comprises a solid-vapor interface as suggested by Stillinger (15).

such as graphite with contact angles near 90◦ will not. These simple thermodynamic arguments show that macroscopic hydrophobic objects dissolved in water should expel the solvent trapped between them if they are brought closer together than a characteristic critical distance Dc that depends on geometry and thermodynamic properties. Although thermodynamics clearly predicts the existence of this drying transition, the free energy barrier between the wet and the dry state could be very large, effectively freezing the system in a metastable state (53, 64, 91, 92). This free energy barrier is responsible for the phenomenon of cavitation-induced hysteresis observed experimentally in surface-force measurements (66, 93).
2.2. Mesoscopic and Microscopic Theory
Do drying transitions and the predictions of macroscopic thermodynamics still hold for proteins and other systems of nanometer or subnanometer dimensions? More detailed microscopic theories capable of describing the large-scale drying limit, heterogeneous solutes, and cavity formation at small length scales are needed to address such questions. The local molecular ﬁeld (LMF) theory developed by Weeks and coworkers (94) is one such microscopic theory. When applied to water, it requires detailed information about the water-water and water-solute interaction potentials. LMF theory can be characterized generally as a mapping that relates structural and thermodynamic properties of a nonuniform system with long-range and slowly varying intermolecular interactions in a given external ﬁeld to those of a simpler reference or mimic system with short-range intermolecular interactions in an effective or renormalized ﬁeld. The short-range interactions in the mimic system are chosen to give an accurate description of the strong forces between typical nearest-neighbor molecules, leading, for example, to the local hydrogen-bond network in water. The effective ﬁeld is determined self-consistently and contains the direct solvent-solute interaction as well as a density-weighted average of the unbalanced forces arising from the remaining long-range parts of the original intermolecular interactions.
LMF theory has been successfully applied to nonuniform Lennard-Jones (LJ) ﬂuids (94–96), to ionic solutions (97–99), and recently to bulk and conﬁned water as described by the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) model (100). Results for solvation, dielectric, and other properties of water are promising. LMF theory also provides a framework for useful semiempirical theories such as the Lum-Chandler-Weeks (LCW) theory of hydrophobicity (20), which is reviewed below.
Another promising microscopic theory is the quasichemical theory of solvation developed by Pratt and coworkers (30, 35, 101–104). The formalism is based on Widom’s inverse potential distribution theory (90) and uses results of a computer simulation in which interactions within an inner solvation shell of an appropriately chosen size around a solute are treated exactly. A Gaussian approximation accounts for the effects of longer-range interactions from molecules in the outer shell. One can avoid errors in this approximation arising from high-energy collisions between inner and outer shell molecules with a conditioning procedure that uses conﬁgurations in which there are no solvent particles in the inner shell region.
LMF and quasichemical theories start from rigorous statistical mechanics foundations and make physically motivated and testable approximations to develop practically useful expressions. Both approaches are under active development, and further research along these lines should shed light on the connections between these theories and on the strengths and weaknesses of related approximate theories such as the LCW theory.
In its initial formulation, LCW theory (20) can be viewed as a simpliﬁcation of LMF theory in which experimental structural and thermodynamic data for the liquid and vapor phases of the solvent are used to make a simple estimate for the slowly varying component of the effective

ﬁeld that induces interface formation, in analogy to the classical van der Waals theory of the liquid-vapor interface (90). In the original application to water near a smooth hydrophobic solute, only the nonuniform oxygen density was considered explicitly. Thus the theory cannot answer questions about changes in orientational order and bond-angle correlations that could be addressed using the microscopic approaches.
Linear response theory is used to calculate the nonuniform density induced by the effective ﬁeld. The linear response function (direct correlation function) is further approximated by a crude interpolation between known results for the uniform bulk liquid [well described by a Gaussian ﬂuctuation model (105)] and the ideal gas. This interpretation of LCW theory and its detailed connections to the full LMF theory can be found in Reference 94.
In many studies of large-scale hydrophobicity only a spatially coarse resolution of the liquid density is needed, and Chandler and coworkers (60, 106, 107) have shown that a simple coarsegrained version of LCW theory using a lattice gas density ﬁeld often sufﬁces to describe the relevant ﬂuctuations of water. This general coarse-grained treatment does not rely on the problematic interpolation approximation used in the original approach and offers a ﬂexible and accurate way to treat substrates with extended hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic regions in many cases (108).
The ﬁrst application of LCW theory was to the solvation of an HS solute in water as a function of its radius (20). Here simulations show that the contact density varies from much greater than the bulk density (i.e., wetting) at small molecular-scale radii to drying at very large radii with a contact density much less than the bulk (109). LCW theory gave good qualitative agreement with simulations, providing in particular a reasonable estimate for the crossover radius of approximately 2 nm, at which the solvation free energy begins to scale with surface area rather than volume.
LMF theory has not been applied to the water-HS system, but detailed results for both theories are available for the analogous problem of an HS solute in an LJ ﬂuid near coexistence. Here the physics is well understood, and LMF theory gives essentially quantitative agreement with simulation results (96). The crossover radius is approximately a factor of ﬁve smaller than for the water-HS system because of the smaller surface tension of the LJ ﬂuid. Again LCW theory provides good qualitative agreement (110), with the main errors arising from the interpolation formula.
Attractive solute-solvent interactions simply add an additional term to the effective ﬁeld in both the LMF and LCW theories. For a solute with a large radius and weak attractions (in which the solute-solvent attraction is much less than the solvent-solvent attraction), the resulting density and entropy are similar to that of a free liquid-vapor interface pulled close to the solute with relatively little distortion of the local interface structure (12). Strong localized solute attractions can of course disrupt this picture and induce a large contact density even for large solutes.
One possible criticism of the LCW approach is that it uses a van der Waals–like theory, known to be appropriate for simple LJ ﬂuids, to describe interfaces in water, a very different liquid. But the LCW theory makes use of experimental data that capture many anomalous features of water. In particular, the large surface tension at the water-vapor interface reﬂects the broken hydrogen bonds that are assumed to also occur at the hydrophobic surface. The theory correctly describes both the Gaussian probability of the formation of small cavities in water (105) and the generic drying and associated interfacial energy that must occur in the hard wall limit.
A related concern is that it does not account explicitly for unbalanced forces arising from longrange dipolar interactions in water. However, detailed calculations using the full LMF theory for SPC/E water near a model hydrophobic wall with weak attractions show that the main unbalanced force at the wall indeed arises from the LJ component of the SPC/E interaction (111). Long-range dipolar interactions have surprisingly little effect on the oxygen density proﬁle, although they do strongly affect the electrostatic potential and other properties not considered in the LCW approach

(100). Thus there is good reason to believe that this qualitative picture holds for idealized HS or for weakly attractive solutes in water.
Much more difﬁcult is the objection that smooth homogeneous objects of varying sizes offer a poor model for real hydrophobic solvation in water. Here molecular granularity and heterogeneity on small length scales involving local polar or charged groups (81) present a new set of challenges beyond the scope of the simple LCW theory. More general microscopic descriptions capable of describing angular and electrostatic correlations are needed; further development of the LMF and quasichemical approaches may provide some insights here. At present, these quantitative questions can best be addressed by careful simulations. This is the focus of the rest of this review.
3. DEWETTING AND HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTION IN LARGE-SCALE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
3.1. Drying Versus Physical Interaction Strength
Theory shows that the dewetting transition is fairly sensitive to the strength of the solute-solvent interaction. A simple explanation follows from the realization that the stronger the attraction between the plate and water (i.e., the larger the LJ ε), the smaller the contact angle will be (112) and correspondingly the smaller the critical distance Dc will be (see Equation 1). Once the contact angle becomes small enough, dewetting should not occur because Dc becomes too small to sterically allow any water molecules.
Simulations of two parallel nanoscale graphite plates show no capillary drying (dewetting) transition for any separation under standard conditions (67, 113), a ﬁnding in agreement with Equation 1 and the small contact angle, θ ≈ 90◦, of graphite. For example, if the carbon atom interacts with water with an LJ interaction parameter εC O = 0.1156 kcal mol−1 (a realistic value), no dewetting (67) transition is observed. The smallness of the contact angle probably arises from the high surface density of carbon atoms in graphite (the aromatic C–C bond is short). Interfacial water molecules can thus interact with several carbon atoms at a time, so the attractive dispersion interaction is sufﬁciently large to lead to a contact angle that is small for a hydrophobic material. Similar results have been found by Pettitt and coworkers (113) with graphite plates and Hummer et al. (114) with carbon nanotubes. If the water-carbon εC O is reduced to 0.0611 kcal mol−1, however, a drying (dewetting) transition is observed (67) with a critical distance of 6.8 A˚ . Alkane chains have in general weaker interactions with water than graphite plates, as seen from their water contact angles. When the water-carbon interaction is further reduced for graphite, the dewetting becomes stronger. The system can also ﬂuctuate between the dry and wet states when εC O is near 0.0647 kcal mol−1, indicating the system is reaching a critical distance for the microscopic phase transition from liquid to vapor. In some systems, even a decrease of 10% in ε can cause dewetting, as we have found in biological protoﬁlaments (115) (see Section 4). Thus many realistic systems likely are close to the transition region, and interface formation represents one possible reaction channel that should be considered.
Superhydrophobic ﬂuorocarbon surfaces have experimental contact angles (116) as large as 135◦ and behave differently from graphite plates. A simulation found that two similar-sized nanoscale plates constructed from Langmuir-Blodgett ﬁlms with terminal CF3 groups dewet with a critical distances of ∼10 A˚ (117). The attractive interaction between the ﬂuorinated carbons atoms and water molecules in the nearest solvation shell was 10%–12% weaker than in plates made of their hydrogenated counterparts. Even though the ﬂuorocarbons have a stronger electrostatic interaction with water in the nearest shell than do the hydrocarbon chains because of their larger partial charges, van der Waals interactions dominate over the electrostatic

interactions, contributing up to 90% of the total interaction energy. The ﬂuorocarbons have a noticeably weaker van der Waals interaction with water in the nearest shell by 10%–15% than do the alkane chains. Both this and its larger surface area per chain lead to stronger dewetting transition plates (117). Model hydrophobic plates (65), with a water contact angle of 148◦, exhibit even larger critical distances (≈14 A˚ ) than ﬂuorocarbon plates of similar size, but it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd such large contact angles in nature.
Above we discuss drying in regions between identical plates, but what happens when the plates are different? The highly approximate macroscopic theory discussed above shows that the critical distance for drying between plates with different contact angles depends on the average of the cosines of their contact angles. Thus two very hydrophobic plates have a larger critical distance than one very hydrophobic and one less hydrophobic one. If one plate were highly hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic (an extreme case), then the average would be very small, and drying would not be expected.
In an intriguing experiment, Granick and coworkers investigated such a system. They studied a Janus interface in which a water slab is trapped between a hydrophobic wall on one side and a hydrophilic wall on the other (48). The latter prevented any macroscopic drying or cavitation of the liquid, which in any case would be strongly affected even by relatively weak van der Waals forces. This allowed them to focus on more intrinsic local properties of interfacial water near extended hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces and to compare behavior in the different regions. Shear deformations produced by moving the hydrophobic surface resulted in very large noisy ﬂuctuations, consistent with the picture of damped capillary waves at the hydrophobic surface arising from partial dewetting. Film-spanning ﬂuctuations that might lead to macroscopic dewetting between hydrophobic surfaces were suppressed by the pinning of water at the hydrophilic wall. No such ﬂuctuations were observed when both interfaces were hydrophilic, as expected. Although some interesting questions remain, this picture of qualitatively different ﬂuctuation behavior at extended hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces is broadly consistent with a growing body of experimental and simulation data (42–47, 49–52, 118). It offers a consistent framework within which one can address many questions of current interest, such as the effects of patterned hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions (58, 80, 108) and the consequences of different geometries. In particular, it should not be surprising that the more hydrophobically enclosed the water is (i.e., the more hydrophobic surface the water is surrounded by), the greater the thermodynamic driving force is toward dewetting.
Above we discuss how water behaves in regions enclosed between two plates, but it is equally, if not more, important to understand how more extreme enclosures such as cavities (addressed in Section 4) or nanotubes affect water. One can, for example, study water in holes made through silicon or in the interior of single-walled carbon nanotubes, in cavities inside folded proteins, or (even more importantly) in active sites of enzymes. A recent review (11) in this series focused on some of these topics (see also Section 4), and we discuss only a few aspects here.
In a pioneering study, Hummer et al. (114) simulated a short single-walled carbon nanotube in a box of liquid water and interpreted their ﬁndings by calculating the local excess chemical potential of water, using potential distribution theorems (119). An initially dry nanochannel of the single-walled carbon nanotube rapidly ﬁlled, and no dewetting was found with the normal carbon-water interaction. Given the loss of hydrogen bonding (and the weak attraction of water to the nanotube carbon atoms), this persistent hydration of the nanotube interior was surprising (as was the wetting between graphite plates). When the carbon-water van der Waals parameter εC O was reduced by 44%, the water occupancy ﬂuctuated in sharp transitions between empty and ﬁlled states, behavior similar to the aforementioned simulations of graphite-like plates with reduced carbon-water interactions (63) or even ﬂuorocarbon plates (117).

(106) showed that similar ﬂuctuation behavior could be reproduced in a simple conﬁned latticegas (Ising) model at states close to coexistence. Fang and coworkers also studied a similar system under the inﬂuence of a mobile external charge as a way to mimic the electrostatic gating of a water nanopore. The designed nanopores showed an excellent on-off gating behavior by only one single external charge (120–122).
3.2. Pressure Effect on Dewetting Giovambattista and coworkers (123) recently simulated the pressure effect on the dewetting between two hydrophobic (dehydroxylated) nanoscale silica plates for different pressures. For hydrophobic plates, increasing the pressure enhanced water structure and pushed water molecules toward the plates and into the interplate region, but the average orientation of water molecules next to the hydrophobic plates did not change upon pressurization, suggesting local stability of the interfacial hydrogen-bond network. The water molecules next to hydrophilic plates were orientationally constrained and capable of only small amplitude orientational ﬂuctuations, and the water structure was insensitive to changing pressure. Even at negative pressures for which neat bulk liquid forms cavities, the conﬁned water remained in the liquid state. These results suggest that upon pressurization, hydrophobic plates behave as soft surfaces (in the sense of accommodating pressure-dependent changes in water structure) while still allowing the partially ordered water molecules with their OH bonds pointing into the solute to ﬂuctuate as they do in the liquid-gas interface. In contrast, hydrophilic plates behave as hard surfaces with strong localized attractive interactions with water that suppress water ﬂuctuations.
Garde and colleagues (22) also studied pressure effects on drying and found, as expected, that decreasing the pressure stabilizes drying and lowers the free energy barrier to the formation of the vapor bubble, thereby speeding up the kinetics of drying in molecular dynamics simulations. Under negative pressures, neat water cavitates, making it no surprise that capillary drying is facilitated at negative pressures.
3.3. Effect of Cosolutes on Hydrophobicity In general, hydrophobic interactions can be altered by dissolving cosolutes in water. This subject has been treated in part in the excellent review by Ball (14).
Since 1888, it has been known that the solubility of globular proteins can be increased or decreased by adding different ions, and these ions have been rank-ordered according to the effect they have on protein solubility through the Hofmeister series. Because ions can affect the polar and nonpolar regions of proteins differently, recent work has aimed at understanding how these operate on nonpolar hydrophobic particles. Hydrophobic association can be decreased or increased by preferential binding or exclusion of the ions from the hydrophobic surface, respectively (124– 126). This has been illustrated recently in a model electrolyte system (127). Experiments and simulation have elucidated the effect of a wide range of ions on the pair potential of mean force of spherical solutes (128). Recent studies are clarifying the effect of ions on the structure of the water interface with hydrophobic surfaces (e.g., see 129–131).
Similarly, hydrophilic cosolutes such as urea denature proteins presumably by altering the hydrophobic interaction, and various mechanisms have been proposed for this action. This is an interesting subject but must be left to another review owing to space limitations. Signiﬁcant recent work has been done recently to determine the mechanism by which urea and other cosolutes reduce hydrophobicity in a simple hydrophobe (132–135) and proteins (136–138), and we expect

4. DEWETTING AND HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTION IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
4.1. Dewetting in Protein Folding
Proteins are often characterized by surfaces containing extended nonpolar regions, and the aggregation and subsequent removal of waters between these hydrophobic surfaces are believed to be central to their self-organization. Because the amino acid residues range from being strongly hydrophobic to strongly hydrophilic (charged residues) and because the carbonyl and amide groups along the peptide backbone are polar and capable of participating in hydrogen bonds, it is challenging to analyze the role of small- and large-scale hydrophobicity, and especially dewetting, in the folding and aggregation of proteins. Important work on the nonpolar conﬁnement of water in nanopores and cavities was recently reviewed (11, 14), so we focus on the complimentary issue of dewetting, although we brieﬂy discuss the powerful effect hydrophobic enclosure has on ligand binding to proteins.
The phenomenon of large-scale capillary drying between approaching strongly hydrophobic plates suggests that ﬂuctuations of water (in particular, bubble creation and annihilation) should be greatly implicated in the kinetics of plate association. In other words, the kinetics of hydrophobic collapse involves a multidimensional reaction coordinate, at least one component of which must be a collective coordinate of water (12, 20). Chandler and coworkers (107) poignantly described the implications of this for hydrophobic chain folding in their study of the collapse from an extended coil state to a compact globule state of a string of 12 purely hydrophobic beads (each with a volume similar to the volumes of amino acids in solution) interacting with a coarse-grained lattice-gas model of water through purely repulsive forces. The evaporation of water in the vicinity of the polymer was implicated in the collapse. Once a sufﬁciently large cluster of beads formed, a Stillinger-like vapor interface formed and seemed to embrace the growing cluster until collapse was complete. They concluded that length-scale-dependent hydrophobic dewetting is the ratelimiting step in the hydrophobic collapse of the model chain system. Chandler and coworkers recently performed molecular dynamics simulations on a similar chain, with larger beads, interacting repulsively with an all-atom model of water and found similar results, although in this latter study the vapor seems to appear in hydrophobically enclosed regions rather than by surrounding a cluster as before (60). This behavior is reminiscent of drying in the region between plates and in other enclosed regions, and not a Stillinger-like vapor layer as seen in the lattice-gas model of water. In addition, they determined the path of maximum likelihood for the dynamical trajectories that conﬁrmed the mechanism of hydrophobic collapse involving collective motion of the solvent as proposed in the earlier study (107). The observed behavior is not surprising as the system consists of large beads with no attractions for water. Athawale et al. (61) made a detailed study of the effects of length scales and attractions on the collapse of hydrophobic polymers and presented a nuanced view of the subject.
Although suggestive, these studies do not show directly that hydrophobic collapse is involved in mechanisms of biological assembly such as protein folding. Because of the timescales involved, to date there has been no successful molecular dynamics simulation of folding from an extended state of realistic proteins in explicit solvent. Nevertheless, it is possible to study the role of water in the collapse of multidomain proteins (e.g., the BphC enzyme) or aggregation of proteins (e.g., the formation of tetramers of melittin) because one can investigate how water behaves as the domains,

or monomers, are brought together. The ﬁrst such study involved bringing the two domains of the BphC enzyme together to see if there was a critical distance for drying between them (70). When either the van der Waals interaction or both the van der Waals and the electrostatic interactions between the protein and water were turned off, the region between the domains exhibited a drying transition, but when the full force ﬁeld was turned on, no complete drying transition was found. Based on this study, it was at ﬁrst thought that dewetting would not occur in proteins because the van der Waals and electrostatic attractions would be too strong. Of course, it is expected that any possible drying would be sensitive to temperature (and pressure). For example, in recent studies of the assembly of Alzheimer amyloid-β 16–22 protoﬁlaments, no drying was observed at room temperature, but drying was observed at a slightly higher temperature (115). When the strength of the 1/r6 terms in the protein-water LJ potential was decreased by 10%, the protoﬁlaments exhibited a drying transition. Given the uncertainties in the force ﬁelds for proteins and the sensitivity of dewetting to the force-ﬁeld parameters, it is difﬁcult to make ﬁrm conclusions presently. Several studies have shown that lowering the pressure can also cause dewetting (22, 72, 123). Anything that brings the liquid closer to coexistence with the vapor should have this effect.
A good place to look for dewetting in protein folding is probably in protein complex formation during the ﬁnal stages of folding. Liu et al. (68) recently studied the water drying transition inside a protein complex—the collapse of the melittin tetramer. Cheng & Rossky (139) previously studied the structure of water near the surface of the melittin monomer.
The two dimers of the melittin tetramer were separated to create a nanoscale channel and then were solvated in a water box. There was a sharp dewetting transition, and essentially all water molecules were expelled from the nanoscale channel after the transition. Simulations with many other separation distances show that the critical distance for the melittin tetramer system is approximately 5.5–7.0 A˚ , which is equivalent to two to three water molecule diameters. The reason that the melittin tetramer channel exhibits a drying transition whereas the previously studied two-domain protein BphC does not (70) appears to be twofold. First, the melittin channel is more enclosed, similar to a tube, whereas the interdomain region in the two-domain protein resembles the region between two plates (see the previous discussion). It is less costly with respect to free energy to disrupt the hydrogen bonds in a tube-like channel. Second, the unique surface topology springing from the isoleucine residues in melittin disrupts the water hydrogen bonds in the channel, thus destabilizing the wet state. When certain isoleucines are mutated to glycine or alanine, the channel wets. Interestingly, Debenedetti and coworkers (72) recently studied the structure and thermodynamics of water conﬁned between two slightly modiﬁed melittin dimers. The density and compressibility of water adjacent to a melittin dimer were intermediate between that observed adjacent to idealized hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces. Meanwhile, solvent cavitation between dimers is observed when the separation between the dimers has closed to a distance of approximately one single water layer (72). This cavitation occurs at smaller pressures and separations than in the case of idealized hydrophobic ﬂat surfaces. The cavitation is also localized in a narrow central region between the dimers around hydrophobic residues. When that hydrophobic residue is replaced by a hydrophilic one, the cavitation disappears. These results seem to be consistent with the previous ﬁndings by Berne and coworkers (68).
4.2. Dewetting in Protein-Ligand Binding
When a ligand binds to a protein, the water solvating the active site is expelled into the bulk ﬂuid. This expulsion of the active-site solvent makes enthalpic and entropic contributions to the binding free energy of the complex. The less energetically or entropically favorable the expelled water is, the more favorable its contributions are to the binding free energy. The active sites of proteins provide

diverse environments for solvating water. Water solvating narrow hydrophobic enclosures such as the COX-2 binding cavity is energetically unfavorable because it cannot form a full complement of hydrogen bonds. Similarly, water molecules solvating enclosed protein hydrogen-bonding sites are entropically unfavorable because the number of conﬁgurations they can adapt while simultaneously forming hydrogen bonds with the protein and their water neighbors is severely reduced (140). The expulsion of water from such enclosed regions can lead to enhancements in protein binding afﬁnity (141, 142). From these observations, Abel et al. (142) determined that a computationally derived map of the thermodynamic properties of the active-site solvent could be used to rank the relative binding afﬁnities of certain classes of congeneric compounds.
Young et al. (140) recently studied water drying inside the protein-ligand binding active sites using molecular dynamics simulations. Three binding cases (including streptavidin, antibody DB3, and COX-2) were examined. In all the cases, water seems simply to be eager to get out of the protein binding cavity. For example, in the streptavidin case, water molecules in the cavity do manage to form some hydrogen bonds with each other and with protein residues, but they are largely trapped on the top and bottom of the hydrophobic surroundings, thus making them less stable both enthalpically and entropically. Conversely, the COX-2 active site contained no persistent hydration sites and was in fact entirely devoid of solvent in 80% of the simulation, despite the cavity being sterically able to accommodate approximately seven water molecules. The high-excess chemical potential of the binding-cavity solvent results from the inability of the water molecules to make hydrogen bonds with the surrounding hydrophobic protein residues and other water molecules. This results in an extreme enthalpic perturbation that drives the dewetting of the cavity. The active-site water molecules of an artiﬁcially hydrated COX-2 structure rapidly disappeared. The active site of COX-2 is predominantly a narrow parafﬁn-like tube and is therefore in line with other studies of hydrophobically induced dewetting (68, 143). A similar effect has been reported for bovine β-lactoglobulin (144). Halle and coauthors showed that an extreme case of a completely dehydrated free binding site is realized for the large nonpolar binding cavity in this protein. They used a combination of water 17O and 2H magnetic relaxation dispersion, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy calculations to establish the absence of water—the large binding pore (315 A˚ 3) is completely empty. The apoprotein is thus poised for efﬁcient binding of fatty acids and other nonpolar ligands (144).
In a subsequent paper, Abel et al. continued the line of research described in Reference 140 by applying the inhomogeneous solvation approach to study ligand binding in factor Xa, an important drug target in the thrombosis pathway, several inhibitors of which are currently in phase III clinical trials (142). They used a clustering technique to build a map of water occupancy in the factor Xa active site and assigned chemical potentials to the water sites using the inhomogeneous solvation theory discussed above (145). They then constructed a semiempirical extension of the model that enables computation of free energy differences ( G values) for pairs of congeneric factor Xa ligands that differ by the deletions of atoms and thus displace different portions of the solvent. These free energy differences correlate exceptionally well with experimental data with few or no adjustable parameters. They hypothesized that the contributions to the binding free energy by adding a complementary chemical group—i.e., chemical groups that make hydrogen bonds where appropriate and hydrophobic contacts otherwise—to a given ligand scaffold could largely be understood by an analysis of the solvent alone.
5. FINAL REMARKS

perspectives from many different disciplines. This diversity has produced its share of conﬂicts, but more importantly, it has illuminated the problem from many different directions. Because of the subtle nature of the hydrophobic effect itself and its interplay with an array of other forces in realistic biophysical environments, much more work is needed before we can claim with any conﬁdence to have even a qualitative understanding in many relevant cases. But we believe that a picture of a soft ﬂuctuating interface structurally similar to the liquid-vapor interface near an extended hydrophobic region is well established and can serve as one cornerstone as we try to extend our understanding from idealized theoretical models to realistic biophysical systems.
