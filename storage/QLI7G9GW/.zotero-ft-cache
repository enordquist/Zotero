The large conductance calcium-sensitive potassium (BK) channel is widely expressed in many organs and tissues, but its in vivo physiological functions have not been fully deﬁned. Here we report a genetic locus associated with a human syndrome of coexistent generalized epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia on chromosome 10q22 and show that a mutation of the a subunit of the BK channel causes this syndrome. The mutant BK channel had a markedly greater macroscopic current. Single-channel recordings showed an increase in openchannel probability due to a three- to ﬁvefold increase in Ca2+ sensitivity. We propose that enhancement of BK channels in vivo leads to increased excitability by inducing rapid repolarization of action potentials, resulting in generalized epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia by allowing neurons to ﬁre at a faster rate. These results identify a gene that is mutated in generalized epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia and have implications for the pathogenesis of human epilepsy, the neurophysiology of paroxysmal movement disorders and the role of BK channels in neurological disease.
Epilepsy is one of the most common and debilitating neurological disorders, affecting more than 40 million people worldwide1. Paroxysmal dyskinesias are another heterogeneous group of neurological disorders characterized by sudden, unpredictable, disabling attacks of involuntary movement often requiring life-long treatment. The coexistence of epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia in the same individual or family is an increasingly recognized phenomenon2,3. The basic pathophysiology underlying the coexistence of epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia is unknown, and no speciﬁc gene has been associated with it.
We studied a large family with coexistent generalized epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia (GEPD; Fig. 1). Sixteen affected individuals developed epileptic seizures (n ¼ 4), paroxysmal nonkinesigenic

dyskinesia (PNKD; n ¼ 7) or both (n ¼ 5). The detailed clinical features of 13 affected individuals, who participated in subsequent genetic studies, are summarized in Table 1. An example of interictal electroencephalography (EEG) showing generalized spike-wave complexes is shown in Figure 2. Pedigree analysis suggested an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. We carried out a genome-wide linkage scan with 382 microsatellite markers that span human chromosomes 1–22 at an average interval of 10 cM. Markers D10S580 and D10S1730 on chromosome 10q22 showed signiﬁcant linkage to GEPD with lod scores of 3.68 and 3.73, respectively. The chromosomal 10q22 region was the only region with a lod score Z 2.0. Fine mapping and haplotype analysis using eight additional markers narrowed the disease-associated interval to a region of 8.4 cM ﬂanked by markers D10S1694 and D10S201 (Fig. 1).
The 10q22 locus associated with GEPD contains 40 genes, including 33 known genes and 7 hypothetical genes. Owing to the importance of ion channels in epilepsy4 and paroxysmal movement disorders such as episodic ataxia5, we hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding ion channels might cause GEPD and identiﬁed two genes encoding ion channels in 8.4-cM region: VDAC2, encoding voltage-dependent anion channel 2, and KCNMA1, encoding the pore-forming a subunit of the BK (or Maxi-K) channel. We did not ﬁnd any mutations in VDAC2. We identiﬁed a heterozygous A-G transition in exon 10 of KCNMA1 in the proband (IV-8) of the family (Fig. 3a). The A-G transition results in the substitution of a negatively charged aspartic acid residue for a neutral glycine residue (D434G) in the regulator of conductance for K+ (RCK) domain (Fig. 3a,b). Amino acid residue Asp434 is conserved among KCNMA1 channels from nematodes to humans (Fig. 3c). DNA sequence analysis detected the presence of mutation 1301A-G in all 13 affected individuals that were genotyped and its absence in 5 unaffected individuals in the family (data not shown). This result was conﬁrmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Furthermore,

the mutation was not detected in 500 unrelated healthy controls. These results suggest that the 1301A-G mutation of KCNMA1 is
responsible for GEPD in this large family.
The BK channel is activated by both membrane depolarization and a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. The pore-forming a subunit
contains seven transmembrane domains (S0–S6) at the N terminus
and an extensive C terminus with four hydrophobic segments (S7– S10) and the Ca2+ bowl (Fig. 3b). Between S6 and S8 is the RCK

domain, which may contain binding sites for a variety of regulatory ligands, including Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 3b)6,7. As mutation D434G is located in the RCK domain, we hypothesized that the mutation could cause abnormal calcium afﬁnity of the BK channel. We expressed wild-type and D434G mutant BK channels in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and recorded current-voltage relations. At a Ca2+ concentration of 2 mM, there was more current induced at the same membrane potential in

oocytes expressing D434G channels than in oocytes expressing the
wild-type channel, and the voltage dependence of steady-state activa-
tion (G-V relation) was shifted more than 57 mV toward more
negative potentials by the D434G mutation, with little change in the slope of the curve (Fig. 4a,b). At a Ca2+ concentration of 0.1 mM, the G-V relation was shifted B26 mV toward more negative potentials by
the D434G mutation (Fig. 4b). These results indicate that the mutant
BK channel has an increased voltage and calcium-dependent activa-
tion. Corresponding to the shifts in voltage dependence of activation,
the D434G currents activated faster than the wild-type currents in
response to a depolarizing voltage pulse (Fig. 4a,c). These results
suggest that during an action potential in neurons, in response to depolarization and Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ chan-
nels, more mutant BK channels open, causing a rapid repolarization of the action potential8.
To deﬁne better the mechanism of the increase in macroscopic
currents, we made single-channel recordings from BK channels
expressed in CHO cells. Both the wild-type channel and the D434G
mutant channel were activated by an increase in voltage or in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, but at a given voltage and Ca2+
concentration, the mutant channel spent substantially more time in the open state (Fig. 5a). At a given Ca2+ concentration, the mutant
channel was activated at lower voltages (Fig. 5b). There was no
difference in the Boltzmann’s slope factors for single channels (wildtype, 9.7 7 4.1 (mean 7 s.d.), n ¼ 9; D434G, 8.8 7 3.7, n ¼ 24; P 4 0.05), and the difference in voltage sensitivity was smaller at saturating levels of Ca2+. These data suggest that the primary effect of the mutation was to increase Ca2+ sensitivity three- to ﬁvefold
(Fig. 5c,d), rather than to affect the voltage sensor, which is consistent with the role of the RCK domain as a high-afﬁnity site for Ca2+ binding. Mutations of the a subunit are known to decrease Ca2+ sensitivity of BK channels9, but none have been reported to increase Ca2+ sensitivity. There are other mechanisms by which Ca2+ sensitivity can be increased, such as by association of the a subunit with the b

subunit10,11; a mutation of the b1 subunit (a predominant isoform in smooth muscle) that further increases Ca2+ sensitivity was recently identiﬁed12. Consistent with the location of the mutation remote from the pore region, there was no change in single-channel conductance (wild-type, 185 7 16 pS (mean 7 s.d.), n ¼ 11; D434G, 180 7 20 pS, n ¼ 11; P 4 0.05). We obtained similar results for single-channel properties from oocyte recordings (data not shown).
An increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of the BK channel leads to greater macroscopic potassium conductance under physiological conditions. Thus, the D434G mutation leads to a gain of function of the a subunit. There are several reasons why gain of function of the BK channel could lead to an increase in brain excitability, causing generalized epilepsy when the thalamus or thalamocortical circuits are involved and paroxysmal dyskinesia when the basal ganglia is involved. The most likely mechanism relates to the more rapid repolarization of action potentials by D434G mutant channels. Enhancing this repolarization enables faster repriming (removal of inactivation) of sodium channels and thus allows neurons to ﬁre at a higher frequency8,13,14. Alternatively, enhancing some inhibitory currents can switch neurons in a circuit into a bursting mode, as can occur with absence seizures that depend on activation of inhibitory GABAB receptors in the thalamus15. Likewise, gain of function of BK channels could lead to greater hyperpolarization and activate the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih)16, resulting in generation of secondary depolarizations. Another possible explanation is that if BK channels are present in GABAergic neurons, an increase in inhibition of these neurons could lead to disinhibition of a neuronal network.
Ethanol can directly activate the BK channel in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans17. This ﬁnding may explain the observation that alcohol triggers dyskinesias in certain individuals in the family reported here. The ability of alcohol to trigger PNKD is well recognized, but the detailed mechanism is still under investigation18. The gain-of-function mutation D434G may have a synergistic effect with ethanol to trigger the onset of the symptoms.
Knockout mice deﬁcient in the BK channel b4 subunit were recently created and characterized (R. Brenner, personal communication).

The b4 subunit is a neuron-speciﬁc inhibitory subunit for the BK current. Mice lacking the BK b4 subunit had a gain of function of BK channels, increased ﬁring rate of knockout cells and spontaneous nonconvulsive seizures (epilepsy). Treatment with paxilline, a speciﬁc blocker for BK channels, reduced the ﬁring rate. These results support our conclusion that gain of function of the BK channel causes GEPD.
The in vivo physiological roles of KCNMA1 remain intriguing. Mice homozygously deﬁcient in Kcnma1 have abnormal conditioned eyeblink reﬂex and abnormal locomotion and motor coordination19. These mice also develop high-frequency hearing loss at 8 weeks of age20. The phenotype of humans with the KCNMA1 mutation 1301A-G seems to be very different from that reported for the knockout mice. One major reason for this difference may be that the human missense mutation is a gain-of-function mutation, whereas the mice lacked BK channels.
Our results provide insight into the pathophysiological role of the BK potassium channel in the central nervous system: abnormally increased BK channel activity can cause epilepsy and dyskinesia. Syndromes of coexistent epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia have been reported, including autosomal dominant benign infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA)21 and related syndromes22. The ICCA phenotype is characterized by paroxysmal

kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) and generalized convulsions in infancy and has been linked to chromosome 16p, but the speciﬁc gene underlying the phenotype has not been identiﬁed yet21. The GEPD phenotype described here differs from ICCA in both the type of seizures and paroxysmal dyskinesia expressed, and linkage to 16p was not observed. PKD has been observed in one affected individual from a family with myokymia and paroxysmal ataxia and a mutation in the potassium channel gene KCNA1 (ref. 23). Different mutations in KCNA1 are associated with different neurological phenotypes, including partial seizures24, but KCNA1 mutations have not been reported as a cause of coexistent seizures and paroxysmal dyskinesia in a single individual. Mutations in potassium channel genes KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are associated with benign familial neonatal seizures4, which are different from the absence seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures reported here. The phenotype reported here most closely resembles a case series of individuals with early-onset absence epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia3. The relationship between epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia is complex, and the full spectrum of coexistent syndromes remains to be deﬁned, but the GEPD syndrome described here seems to be distinct from those reported to date.
In summary, this study identiﬁes a new genetic locus for GEPD on chromosome 10q22 and establishes that mutations of the BK channel cause GEPD. Our study also suggests that BK channel– blocking agents might be used as a potential therapy for epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia.

METHODS Human subjects. This study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board on Human Subjects. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians. The affected individuals and family members were identiﬁed and clinically characterized at the Department of Neurology of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The family under study is of mixed European descent and was referred to this study from the adult epilepsy clinic as a result of the diagnosis of epilepsy in multiple family members. We constructed a detailed pedigree. We obtained clinical information through semistructured interviews in person and by telephone, carried out by a neurologist with specialty training in epilepsy and clinical neurophysiology. Seizure histories were corroborated by eyewitnesses when possible. When applicable, we obtained records of interictal EEG and video-EEG. We deﬁned epilepsy as two or more unprovoked seizures. We classiﬁed seizure types in accordance with the International Classiﬁcation of Epileptic Seizures25. We classiﬁed epilepsy syndromes in accordance with the International Classiﬁcation of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes26.
The proband (individual IV-8; Fig. 1a) was 21 years old when she was interviewed. She had normal birth and early development. Routine neurological exam gave normal results. At 2 years of age, she developed episodes of involuntary mouth movement and hand stiffness, lasting 10 s to 2 min, with preserved consciousness; these occurred weekly, were more common with fatigue, were not triggered by sudden movement and were diagnosed as paroxysmal dyskinesia. At approximately the same age, she developed separate episodes of loss of awareness, with vacant staring and unresponsiveness, characteristic of typical absence seizures. There was no aura, and these absence seizures occurred daily in early childhood, progressively decreasing in frequency to monthly seizures in adolescence, with medication. Routine EEG showed generalized spike-wave complexes.
Her paternal ﬁrst cousin (individual IV-1) had episodes of vacant staring and episodes of paroxysmal dyskinesia without loss of awareness. She was evaluated with inpatient continuous video-EEG. Her interictal EEG showed generalized spike-wave complexes. Episodes of vacant staring and eyelid ﬂuttering were associated with bursts of generalized spike-wave complexes, conﬁrming their epileptic nature. Episodes of paroxysmal dyskinesia were not associated with any EEG change, conﬁrming their nonepileptic nature. At 5 years of age, she developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
Epileptic seizures, in other family members affected with epilepsy, were typically absence seizures, with generalized tonic-clonic seizures in two other individuals (individuals IV-1 and IV-2). The age of onset of absence seizures in the family is earlier than usual for typical absence seizures, but such an early age of onset has been described in a series of individuals with coexistent absence epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia3. The seizure types exhibited by this family have no resemblance to benign familial neonatal seizures or benign infantile convulsions. There was no evidence for myoclonic seizures in any of the affected individuals.
The proband’s seizures were responsive to valproate and lamotrigine. The seizure frequency in the proband has varied from daily (when she was younger and not taking medications regularly) to monthly (her seizure frequency in current years on valproate and/or lamotrigine). Individuals IV-1 and IV-2 had seizures and paroxysmal dyskinesia partially responsive to clonazepam.
Paroxysmal dyskinesia can be broadly classiﬁed into two main subtypes: PKD, if the attacks are induced by sudden movement, and PNKD, if they are not18,27. Paroxysmal dyskinesias, in those affected, were often described as involuntary dystonic or choreiform movements of the mouth, tongue and extremities, nonkinesigenic but induced by alcohol, fatigue and stress, most consistent with PNKD. PNKD in this family had onset in childhood and showed a gradual decrease in frequency with age but persisted into the fourth decade in some individuals. The human subjects had no complaints of hearing loss or other neurological symptoms and had no evidence for hearing loss on routine neurological exam.
Genotyping and linkage analysis. We prepared human genomic DNA from whole blood with the DNA Isolation Kit for Mammalian Blood (Roche Diagnostic Co). We carried out genome-wide genotyping using 382 polymorphic, ﬂuorescently labeled microsatellite markers on chromosomes 1–22 (ABI PRISM Linkage Mapping Set-MD10) as described previously28. We

identiﬁed additional markers in the Genethon database and used them for ﬁne mapping and haplotype analysis. We genotyped markers using an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Allele-calling was carried out by GeneScan and GeneMapper 2 software programs (Applied Biosystems). We carried out linkage analysis and calculated two-point lod scores using the Linkage Package 5.2, assuming autosomal dominant inheritance, penetrance of 99%, a phenocopy rate of 0%, gene frequency of 1/10,000 and allele frequency of 1/n (where n equals the number of alleles observed).
Mutational analysis. We carried out mutation analysis using direct DNA sequence analysis. We determined the genomic structure of KCNMA1 by comparing its 3,537-bp cDNA sequence to its genomic sequence and found that it contained 27 exons. We then designed PCR primers (sequences available on request) based on intronic sequences to amplify all 27 coding exons. We puriﬁed PCR products from agarose gels using the QIAquick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced them with both forward and reverse primers using an ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). We used restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to conﬁrm the D434G mutation and to test the presence or absence of the mutation in other family members and 400 normal controls. The D434G mutation creates a Tsp45I restriction site. We digested the 201-bp PCR fragment containing exon 10, where the 1301A-G mutation is located, by incubating it with Tsp45I. We separated the digested product on 2% agarose gels and analyzed it.
Cloning and mutagenesis. We cloned human KCNMA1 cDNA into plasmid pcDNA3, resulting in an expression construct for the BK channel (gifts from I.B. Levitan and Y. Zhou, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and from L. Salkoff and A. Butler, Washington University Medical School). We introduced the D434G mutation into the KCNMA1-pcDNA3 construct using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and conﬁrmed it by sequencing the full KCNMA1 insert. To create the expression constructs for X. laevis oocyte expression, we subcloned the full-length wild-type and mutated KCNMA1 cDNAs into the pSP64 Poly(A) vector (KCNMA1-pSP64) using restriction enzymes HindIII and XbaI.
Electrophysiological characterization of human BK channels in X. laevis oocytes. We digested KCNMA1-pSP64 DNA with EcoRI and prepared cRNA using the In Vitro Transcription kit with SP6 polymerase. We injected 5 ng of cRNA into each X. laevis oocyte 2–6 d before recording. We recorded macroscopic currents from inside-out patches formed with borosilicate pipettes of 0.9–1.8 MO resistance. We acquired data using an Axopatch 200-B patch clamp ampliﬁer (Axon Instruments) and Pulse acquisition software (HEKA Electronik). We digitized records at 20-ms intervals and low pass–ﬁltered them at 10 kHz with the Axopatch’s 4 pole Bessel ﬁlter. During G-V measurements, the series resistance at maximum current amplitude will typically cause a voltage error r 5 mV. The error will be smaller at voltages at which the activation of channels is not saturated. The shape of the G-V relation and its voltage range affected by this error are smaller than the standard deviation (Fig. 4). The pipette solution contained 140 mM K-methanesulfonic acid, 20 mM HEPES buffer, 2 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.20). The basal internal solution contained 140 mM K-methanesulfonic acid, 20 mM HEPES buffer, 2 mM KCl and 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.20). We added CaCl2 to internal solutions to give the appropriate free intracellular Ca2+ concentration. All recordings were obtained at room temperature (22–24 1C).
Electrophysiological characterization of human BK channels in mammalian cells. For single-channel recordings from CHO cells, we subcloned KCNMA1 cDNA (wild-type and mutated) into a pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) with the restriction enzymes NheI and XhoI. We plated CHO cells onto coverslips in 12-well Falcon plates and transfected them with 0.8 mg of DNA per well using lipofectamine (4 ml per well; Life Technologies) 6–12 h before recording. We placed coverslips in a recording chamber on an inverted light microscope (Axiovert 100, Zeiss) and superfused them with Ringer solution at 2 ml min–1. We selected transfected cells by visualizing GFP ﬂuorescence. We made patch-clamp recordings with borosilicate glass electrodes fabricated using a P-97 microelectrode puller (Sutter Instruments). We ﬁlled microelectrodes (20–100 MO) with a solution containing 144 mM KCl, 16 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM TES, 11 mM glucose, 0.065 mM CaCl2 and 0.08 mM EGTA.

After obtaining a patch, we moved the electrode tip into a separate minichamber29 and exposed the inside face of the patch to the same solution (at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml min–1) in which we varied the amount of CaCl2 to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 mM (calculated using Webmaxc). We recorded single-channel currents in the inside-out conﬁguration from patches with one to six channels at room temperature in voltage clamps from a holding potential of –60 mV to test potentials from –100 to +100mV (steps of 20 mV for 3 seconds each). We low pass–ﬁltered the currents at 2 kHz and digitized them at a rate of 10 kHz using an Axopatch 1D ampliﬁer, Digidata 1322a A/D converter and PClamp software (Axon Instruments). We determined the number of channels in each patch using all-points histograms from recordings made at each level of Ca2+ concentration and voltage. If these histograms did not indicate the number of channels present, then we rejected the data from that patch. We analyzed the open-channel probability using Clampﬁt software (Axon Instruments) and ﬁt the data to the Boltzmann and Hill equations using Origin Software (OriginLab Corp).
