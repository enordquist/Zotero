The voltage-sensor domain (VSD) of voltage-dependent ion channels and enzymes is critical for cellular responses to membrane potential. The VSD can also be regulated by interaction with intracellular proteins and ligands, but how this occurs is poorly understood. Here, we show that the VSD of the BK-type K؉ channel is regulated by a state-dependent interaction with its own tethered cytosolic domain that depends on both intracellular Mg2؉ and the open state of the channel pore. Mg2؉ bound to the cytosolic RCK1 domain enhances VSD activation by electrostatic interaction with Arg-213 in transmembrane segment S4. Our results demonstrate that a cytosolic domain can come close enough to the VSD to regulate its activity electrostatically, thereby elucidating a mechanism of Mg2؉-dependent activation in BK channels and suggesting a general pathway by which intracellular factors can modulate the function of voltage-dependent proteins.

Voltage-dependent ion channels are modular proteins (1) containing four voltage-sensor domains (VSDs) that control the opening and closing of a central pore domain. Each VSD contains charged residues in transmembrane segments that sense changes in membrane potential. VSDs are important for controlling not only ion channel pores but also enzymatic activity (2) and can serve as stand-alone proton channels in the absence of a separate pore domain (3, 4). Because VSDs impact multiple aspects of cellular function, it is important to understand how VSD function is regulated. Many intracellular factors such as ligand binding, posttranslational modification, and the presence of cytosolic domains, accessory proteins, or subunits can alter the function of voltagedependent ion channels (5). In some cases such modulation is thought to involve the voltage sensor (6–10). However, the mechanisms by which intracellular factors and VSDs interact are poorly understood. BK channels are activated by membrane depolarization, intracellular Ca2ϩ, and Mg2ϩ (11) and are essential for modulating muscle contraction and neuronal activities such as synaptic transmission and hearing (12, 13). Like other voltagedependent Kϩ (Kv) channels, BK channels possess a VSD where the S4 segment contains multiple Arg residues (14, 15). However, in BK channels, only one of these, R213, contributes to voltage sensing (15–18). Interestingly, neutralizing R213 by mutation (R213Q) not only alters voltage-dependent activation but also abolishes Mg2ϩ-dependent activation of BK channels, revealing that the VSD contributes to Mg2ϩ sensitivity, although the mechanism is unknown (18). Here, we investigate the mechanism of Mg2ϩ action to determine whether and how the VSD interacts with Mg2ϩ ions that are bound to the BK channel’s COOH-terminal cytosolic domain.
Results
Mg2؉ May Activate the VSD by Electrostatic Interaction. Physiological concentrations of Mg2ϩ in the low millimolar range activate BK channels, independent of the effects of micromolar Ca2ϩ, by binding to a site that includes residues E374 and E399 (19–21). The putative Mg2ϩ binding site is located in a cytosolic domain that is homologous to the RCK1 domain of MthK and Escherichia coli Kϩ

channels (19, 22–25). Fig. 1a shows the structure of the cytosolic domain of MthK, in which the residues at positions corresponding to E374 and E399 of the mSlo1 BK channel (E138, N158) have been changed to Glu and colored red. The Mg2ϩ binding site is apparently exposed on the surface of the RCK1 domain, facing the membrane. The distance between the Mg2ϩ binding site and the central axis of the MthK channel pore (Ϸ31 Å) roughly coincides with that between the C terminus of S4 and the central axis of the Kv1.2 channel (Fig. 1a, yellow circle), suggesting that the Mg2ϩ site and VSD of the BK channel may lie close together. However, the detailed structure of the BK channel is unknown. Moreover, the BK channel is a complex allosteric protein whose cytosolic domain is thought to undergo conformational changes associated with ligand binding and channel opening (11). Therefore, it is not clear whether Mg2ϩ and the VSD interact directly or indirectly, through what physical mechanism, or in which conformational state(s). One possibility, depicted in Fig. 1b, is that the binding of the Mg2ϩ may alter the local electric field that is sensed by charged residues in the VSD, thereby activating the channel. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that Mg2ϩ shifts the voltage dependence of channel opening to more negative voltages and that the neutralization of R213 abolishes Mg2ϩ sensitivity (18). Another line of evidence supporting this hypothesis is that Mg2ϩ-dependent activation is sensitive to the ionic strength of intracellular solution. In our normal intracellular solution with intracellular Kϩ concentration ([Kϩ]i) ϭ 142 mM (see Methods), 10 mM Mg2ϩ activates the channel by shifting the voltage dependence of conductance (G-V relationship) to more negative voltages ⌬V1/2 ϭ Ϫ60 Ϯ 3.8 mV, where V1/2 is the voltage at half-maximum conductance (Fig. 1 c and d). The amount of G-V shift caused by 10 mM Mg2ϩ increases in lower [Kϩ]i and decreases in higher [Kϩ]i (Fig. 1e), as expected if Mg2ϩ activates the channel by an electrostatic interaction. To the contrary, ionic strength does not significantly affect Ca2ϩdependent activation (Fig. 1e), suggesting that Ca2ϩ does not activate the channel by an electrostatic interaction and the changes in ionic strength do not affect Ca2ϩ binding. Similarly, the strong response of Mg2ϩ-dependent activation to ionic strength may not reflect changes in Mg2ϩ binding.
A Positive Charge on Residue 397 Produces Effects Similar to Mg2؉. To further test the idea that an electrostatic interaction underlies Mg2ϩ action, we compared the effects on BK channel gating of Mg2ϩ with those of adding charges to position 397 (Q397; Fig. 1 a and b). Q397

lies close to the Mg2ϩ-binding site, based on the MthK structure, and it is only one residue away from E399 in the primary sequence. Our previous results suggest that adding charges to this position by mutation or chemical modification does not abolish Mg2ϩdependent activation but affects Mg2ϩ sensitivity through electrostatic interaction with the bound Mg2ϩ (21). Thus, the electric field of the charge at position 397 overlaps that of bound Mg2ϩ. Therefore, if our hypothesis is correct, a positive charge at position 397 should have effects on channel activation that are qualitatively similar to those of Mg2ϩ, as if a cation was constitutively bound near the Mg2ϩ site.
Consistent with the above prediction, mutations of Q397 to positively charged amino acids (Q397K, Q397R) activate the channel by shifting the G-V relation to more negative voltages in the absence of intracellular Mg2ϩ (Fig. 2 a and b). Also consistent with an electrostatic interaction, mutations of Q397 to negatively charged amino acids (Q397E, Q397D) shift the G-V relation to more positive voltages, whereas Q397C has insignificant effects on the G-V relation (P Ͼ 0.05). Similar to Mg2ϩ-dependent activation, the G-V shift caused by mutation Q397K is also affected by ionic strength (Fig. 2c). The fractional changes of ⌬V1/2 caused by Mg2ϩ and the mutation superimpose at low [Kϩ]i and only differ at high [Kϩ]i. Because the mutation adds a charge permanently to the channel, this result further suggests that changing ionic strength alters Mg2ϩ-dependent activation primarily by affecting an electrostatic interaction, with only a small effect on Mg2ϩ binding. BK channels traverse multiple states during activation (11). Interestingly, the change in electric field produced by Mg2ϩ binding is not felt uniformly by all these transitions. Unlike the G-V relation, the voltage dependence of activation kinetics (␶-V relation) is not shifted by increasing intracellular Mg2ϩ concentration ([Mg2ϩ]i) from 0 to 10 mM (27–29).¶ Similarly, the mutations Q397R and Q397K do not shift the ␶-V relation (Fig. 2d), further supporting

that positive charges at position 397 affect the same set of gating transitions as Mg2ϩ.
The effects of adding a positive charge to position 397 by chemical modification also mimic qualitatively the effects of Mg2ϩ binding on the G-V relation (Fig. 2 e and f ). In this experiment, the Q397C mutant was treated with the Cys-modifying reagent MTSET(ϩ) at the intracellular side during patch-clamp recordings. Because MTSET(ϩ) is known to alter the voltage dependence of WT BK channels by modifying C430 (30), the channels in our study contained another mutation C430A to eliminate this background effect of MTSET(ϩ). Modification of Q397C by MTSET(ϩ) shifted the G-V relation to more negative voltages in the absence of Mg2ϩ, indicating that the covalent addition of a positive charge to Q397C activates the channel. The results in Fig. 2 suggest that the gating of the BK channel is affected primarily by alterations in charge near the Mg2ϩ-binding site. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that there are differences in the G-V shift produced by mutation and chemical modification of position 397 and Mg2ϩ binding, which may reflect differences in the number, orientation, and environment of charges as well as their distance relative to the VSD.
State-Dependent Interaction Between Mg2؉ and VSD. The movement of the voltage sensor in response to a change in voltage generates a transient gating current (Ig). If Mg2ϩ activates the channel through electrostatic interactions with the VSD, it should alter Ig. BK channel voltage sensors can move between the resting and activated state and generate gating current no matter whether channels are closed or open (16, 31) (Fig. 3). However, voltage-sensor activation occurs at less depolarized voltages in the open conformation, thereby promoting voltage-dependent opening (31). The results in Fig. 3 show that, consistent with our hypothesis, Mg2ϩ enhances voltage-sensor activation, but interestingly, Mg2ϩ acts primarily when channels are open and has little effect when channels are closed.

with movement of the voltage sensor from the resting to the activated state, and in BK channels it is very rapid compared with the opening of the pore and rise of Kϩ current (Fig. 3a). Thus the movement of the voltage sensor is essentially complete before channels open, and IgON reflects voltage sensor movement when channels are closed. The amplitude of IgON is slightly larger in 10 mM than in 0 [Mg2ϩ]i (Ϸ10% increase at ϩ250 mV; data not shown), whereas the time course of IgON is not altered (Fig. 3c). The relationship between gating charge movement and membrane voltage when channels are closed (QC-V relation), determined by integrating the area under the IgON traces at various voltages, exhibits no significant change between 0 and 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]i (Fig. 3b) (Ϸ10-mV difference in the voltage at the half-maximum of the QC-V relation, Vhc). These results indicate that Mg2ϩ does not affect the closed channel significantly, which may also explain why Kϩ ionic current (IK) activation kinetics are insensitive to Mg2ϩ (Fig. 2d).
On the other hand, off Igs (IgOFF), which reflect the return of the voltage sensor from the activated to the resting state, are decreased in amplitude and slowed by 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]i (Fig. 3 c and d). Under our experimental conditions (see Methods) Kϩ currents through the

All measurements were made in 0 [Mg2ϩ]i unless indicated otherwise.
pore are blocked but channels are still open in response to depolarization (31). Therefore, a fraction of channels are open at the end of a voltage pulse when IgOFF is recorded. To examine whether the change of IgOFF is related to the fraction of open channels, we measured IgOFF after pulses of various duration (Fig. 3c). After a 0.30-ms voltage pulse, few channels are open and IgOFF is similar in the presence or absence of Mg2ϩ. However, as pulse duration increases IgOFF amplitude is greatly reduced in 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]i (red traces, Fig. 3c), indicating that Mg2ϩ affects voltage sensor movement more significantly when channels are open. Previous studies indicate that voltage-sensor deactivation is slowed when channels are open even in the absence of Mg2ϩ (31, 32) (Fig. 3d). In our experiment at ϩ250 mV, channels should be almost maximally activated in the presence or absence of Mg2ϩ (Figs. 1d and 3b).

Therefore, the greater effect on IgOFF in 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]i (Fig. 3d) does not merely reflect a change in open probability but rather implies that deactivation of voltage sensors in open channels is slowed by Mg2ϩ.
The charge-voltage relation for open BK channels (QO-V) is difficult to measure directly from gating currents because, in contrast to the case of voltage-sensor activation and channel opening (Fig. 3a), the time course of voltage-sensor deactivation is not much faster than channel closing (31). However, a shift in the QO-V relation to more negative voltages caused by 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]i is evident from the voltage dependence of open probability (Po) at negative voltages (Fig. 3f ). BK channels can open even when voltage sensors are in the resting state; thus Po can be measured at voltages more negative than the range of voltage-sensor activation (33). Such openings have weak voltage dependence as indicated by the red line in Fig. 3f. At more positive voltages the Log(Po)-V relation becomes steeper (solid lines in Fig. 3f ) because of voltagesensor activation, and this inflection in slope provides an indication of the position of the QO-V relation along the voltage axis (32). Clearly, Mg2ϩ does not affect channel opening when the voltage sensor is in the resting state because the Log(Po)-V relations in 0 and 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]i superimpose at the most negative voltages. Mg2ϩ increases Po only at potentials where voltage sensors can activate and shifts the inflection point in the Log(Po)-V relation to more negative voltages, indicating that Mg2ϩ enhances voltage-sensor activation when the channel is open. This result is consistent with an earlier report (26). Fitting the Log(Po)-V relations over a wide range of the Po with a well established model that describes the voltage-dependent activation of BK channels (33) (see Methods) reveals that 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]i shifts the Qo-V relation by Ϫ50 Ϯ 2 mV (Fig. 3g).
Similar to Mg2ϩ binding, a positive charge at residue 397 enhances voltage-sensor activation more when channels are open. QC-V relations for the mutant channels Q397R and Q397K are similar to those of the WT (Fig. 3b). Modification of the Q397C channel by MTSET(ϩ) reduces the amplitude and slows the relaxation of IgOFF but leaves IgON unchanged (Fig. 3e). The mutation Q397R, like Mg2ϩ, has no effect on Po at very negative voltages, but shifts voltage-sensor activation for open channels to more negative voltages by Ϫ24 Ϯ 2 mV (Fig. 3 f and g), similar to the shift in the G-V relation by Q397R (Fig. 2c). Because the Q397R channel is still sensitive to Mg2ϩ (21), the charges of the Arg side chain and the bound Mg2ϩ must be located at different positions. Given this difference, the similar effects on voltage-sensor activation and channel opening produced by the spatially separated Arg at 397 and bound Mg2ϩ suggest that the interaction between cytosolic and VSDs is mediated by long-range electrostatic interactions.
R213 in Transmembrane Segment S4 Senses Mg2؉. Which residues in the VSD sense the changes in the electric field as a result of Mg2ϩ binding and are responsible for the functional changes in channel gating? Analysis of the primary sequence of BK channels indicates that 12 charged residues in the VSD (S1–S4 and the S4–S5 linker) may be exposed to cytosol. We mutated each of these residues individually to alter their charge and examined the effects of these mutations on the shift of the G-V relation in response to 10 mM Mg2ϩ (Fig. 4a). Of all of these mutations, only R213C completely abolishes Mg2ϩ sensitivity (Fig. 4 a and b), consistent with the previous finding that R213Q abolishes Mg2ϩ sensitivity (18). Residue 213 is located in the C-terminal half of S4, is accessible to intracellular Cys-modifying reagents when the voltage sensor is in the resting state (18), and contributes to gating charge (14, 15). Thus, this residue is a sensor of both membrane voltage and Mg2ϩ binding. Fig. 4b shows that when R213 is mutated to Cys the substitution of a positively charged residue at position 397 (the double mutation R213C:Q397R) no longer shifts the G-V relation to negative voltages, supporting that R213 is the main sensor of

charges around the Mg2ϩ-binding site. Finally, if Mg2ϩ activates the channel by an electrostatic interaction with the charge of R213, adding a positive charge back to position 213 should rescue some of the Mg2ϩ sensitivity that is lost because of the R213C mutation. As expected, modification of R213C channels, but not R213Q, by MTSEA(ϩ) restores Mg2ϩ sensitivity such that the deactivation of the channel is slowed down and the G-V relation is shifted to more negative voltages by 10 mM Mg2ϩ (Fig. 4 c and d). The results in Fig. 4 indicate that a positive charge at residue 213 is sufficient and necessary for the VSD to sense Mg2ϩ binding and bears the primary responsibility for Mg2ϩ-dependent activation.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that in BK channels the VSD senses not only membrane voltage but also intracellular Mg2ϩ to control channel activation (Fig. 1b). Mg2ϩ binding in the cytosolic domain alters the electric field at R213 in S4 to promote the occupation of the activated state by the voltage sensor, thereby favoring the open state of the channel. This mechanism is based on three lines of evidence: (i) Mg2ϩ-dependent activation strongly depends on intracellular ionic strength, (ii) positive charges at residue 397, close to the Mg2ϩ-binding site, alter channel gating similarly to Mg2ϩ in all major aspects, whereas negative charges at this site inhibit activation, and (iii) a positive charge at residue 213 in S4 is necessary and sufficient to sustain Mg2ϩ sensitivity. Although intracellular ionic strength influences Mg2ϩ-dependent activation, it has only a small effect on Ca2ϩ-dependent activation (Fig. 1e). Similarly, charges at residues 397 and 213 have little effect on Ca2ϩ sensitivity (ref. 17 and data not shown). Considering that the Mg2ϩ-binding site is located in the N-terminal half of the RCK1 domain, which is also important for Ca2ϩ-dependent activation (34), these results suggest that Mg2ϩ or the charges at residue 397 do not cause a global change in channel structure. Rather, they are involved in a local interaction specific for Mg2ϩ-dependent activation. On the other hand, the charges at residue 397 were able to reproduce the effects of Mg2ϩ on channel gating regardless if they were introduced via mutation or cysteine modification, and differences in side-chain

size, orientation, or charge distribution only result in minor quantitative variations of the effects. These results are compatible with a long-range electrostatic interaction.
During voltage-dependent activation, S4 moves in response to voltage changes to open the channel. Our results indicate that R213 in BK channel S4 can be sufficiently close to its tethered cytosolic domain to interact electrostatically with bound Mg2ϩ and charge at residue 397. Because the energy of the electrostatic interaction is manifested as a shift in the Qo-V relation we can estimate the average distance between the charges of R213 and R397 as follows. Because voltage sensors in each of the four BK channel ␣-subunits are thought to activate independently via a two-state process (31, 32), the energy to shift the QO-V is:

⌬G͓QO͔ ϭ ⌬V1/2 * zg,

[1]

where zg is the gating charge per voltage sensor (zg ϭ 0.58e) (15) and ⌬V1/2 ϭ Ϫ24 mV (Fig. 3 f and g). The energetic effect on voltage-sensor activation produced by electrostatic interaction of
Q397R with R213 is:

⌬G͓R213͔ ϭ ͑␺R Ϫ ␺A͒ * zR213,

[2]

where ␺R and ␺A are the electrostatic potentials imposed by 397R on R213 in the resting and activated state, respectively, and zR213 is the charge of R213 (zR213 ϭ e). Because ␺ falls off quickly with distance and in the activated state R213 is likely to be buried in the protein because it is a gating charge (15), we can assume ␺A ϽϽ ␺R. Thus, combining Eqs. 1 and 2 to solve for ⌬G[QO] ϭ ⌬G[R213] yields:

␺R ϭ 0.58 * ⌬V1/2.

[3]

This electrostatic potential between the charges of R213 and R397 (␺R ϭ 13.9 mV) implies that the average distance between them in the resting state is 9.1 Å (see Methods for calculation). This
calculation may overestimate the distance if R213 also interacts
with 397R when the voltage sensor is in the activated state. Such a
short distance between the membrane-spanning and the cytosolic
domains in BK channels is consistent with the structure of BK
channels, in which a short peptide linker of only 17 aa connects S6
to the cytosolic domain (35). Thus it is reasonable to expect that
close interaction between the membrane spanning and the cytosolic
domains can occur. We find that the effect of Mg2ϩ is state-dependent, enhancing
voltage-sensor activation primarily when the channel is open. Although Mg2ϩ has been proposed to bind with lower affinity to
closed than open channels (36), state-dependent binding cannot account for the lack of effect of Mg2ϩ on QC-V. First, 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]i is higher than the estimated dissociation constant of the closed channel (36) so that more than half of the Mg2ϩ-binding sites
should be occupied when channels are closed. Second, the permanent addition of positive charge at residue 397 near the Mg2ϩ-
binding site also has no effect on QC-V (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these results indicate that the interaction between the bound Mg2ϩ
and the VSD is state-dependent, presumably involving a confor-
mational change in the cytosolic domain and/or VSD upon channel opening that exposes R213 to the electric field of the bound Mg2ϩ.
One possibility is that the distance between R213 and the bound Mg2ϩ is enlarged in the closed state because of the relative
movements between S4 and the cytosolic domain. The crystal
structures of MthK channels suggest that the cytosolic gating ring
may expand 8 Å at the outer rim in parallel to the membrane from
the closed to the open conformation (37). On the other hand, in BK (15) and Shaker (38) Kϩ channels rearrangements of the VSD have
been suggested to occur upon channel opening. Similar changes in
BK channels may change the distance between R213 and the bound Mg2ϩ. Another possibility is that the conformational rearrange-
ments in the VSD and the cytosolic domain during channel opening

may change the orientation of R213 or the bound Mg2ϩ such that the side chain of R213 is only exposed to the electric field of the bound Mg2ϩ in the open state. The detailed mechanism of the state dependence of Mg2ϩ modulation is not known at this time. Nevertheless, it is clear that VSD activity is regulated not only by Mg2ϩ bound to the cytosolic domain but also by feedback from the activation gate in the pore domain.
Aside from elucidating the mechanism of Mg2ϩ-dependent activation in BK channels, our results also demonstrate that a tethered cytosolic protein domain can come close enough to the VSD to regulate its activity through electrostatic interaction. This interaction sets precedence that various cytosolic domains, accessory subunits, or regulatory proteins may, through a similar mechanism, regulate the function of other ion channels or enzymes that contain VSDs. Introduction of charged residues at position 397 in the BK channel alters voltage-sensor activation, suggesting that interactions between the VSD and native charged residues in the cytosolic domain may normally exist and influence VSD function even in the absence of a charged ligand. A similar example may involve the cytosolic tetramerization (T1) domain of Kv channels where mutation of some charged residues facing the transmembrane domain produce large shifts in the voltage dependence of channel activation through unknown mechanisms (39, 40). Importantly, charges in the cytosolic domain of the BK channel do not act merely to bias the voltage detected by the VSD, as in the case of surface-charge effects (41). Rather, the impact of these charges varies as the relative position of cytosolic and VSDs change during channel opening. Similarly, it is possible that conformational changes in the cytosolic domain induced by neutral ligands or ligands distal from the VSD may expose the VSD to native charges to alter the activation of channels and enzymes. Finally, the VSD may be regulated by signaling processes other than ligand binding because posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, sulfation, oxidation, protonation, and methylation can increase or decrease the charge of amino acid side chains in cytosolic domains.
Methods
Mutagenesis and Expression. All channel constructs were made from the mbr5 clone of the mouse Slo1 BK (mSlo1) by using PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR-amplified regions of all mutants were verified by sequencing. RNA was transcribed in vitro with T3 polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX). We injected 0.05–50 ng (for macroscopic currents and limiting Popen recordings) or 150–250 ng (for gating currents) of RNA into each Xenopus laevis oocyte 2–6 days before recording.
Electrophysiology. Ionic currents were recorded with inside-out patches with an Axopatch 200-B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and Pulse acquisition software (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) (19). The pipette solution contains 140 mM KMeSO3, 20 mM Hepes, 2 mM KCl, and 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.2. The internal solution contains 140 mM KMeSO3, 20 mM Hepes, 2 mM KCl, and 1 mM N-(2hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,NЈ,NЈ-triacetic acid (HEDTA), pH 7.2. CaCl2 was added to the internal solution to give the appropriate free intracellular Ca2ϩ concentration ([Ca2ϩ]i), which was measured with a calcium-sensitive electrode. For 0 [Ca2ϩ]i, the same internal solution was used except that HEDTA was substituted by 5 mM EGTA and no CaCl2 was added. The basal internal solution for ionic strength experiments contains 20 mM Hepes, 15 mM KOH and 5 mM EGTA for 0 [Ca2ϩ]i and 20 mM Hepes, 6.5 mM KOH for 200 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i, pH 7.2. KCl was added to reach the target [Kϩ]is. A sewer pipe flow system was used to perfuse the internal solution on the cytosolic face of the patch. Po (Ͻ0.01–0.1) at negative voltages was measured by single-channel recordings in patches containing hundreds of channels (17, 33).
Gating currents were recorded with inside-out patches (31). The pipette solution contains 127 mM tetraethylammonium hydroxide,

125 mM HMeSO3, 2 mM HCl, 2 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2. The internal solution contains 141 mM N-methyl-Dglucamine, 135 mM HMeSO3, 6 mM HCl, 20 mM Hepes, and 5 mM EGTA, pH 7.2. MgCl2 was added to the internal solution to reach 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]i. Voltage commands were filtered at 20 kHz with an eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) to prevent the saturation of fast capacitive transients (31). Data were sampled at 100,000 Hz with an 18-bit A/D converter (ITC-18; Instrutech, Mineola, NY) and filtered at 10 kHz with Axopatch’s internal filter. Capacitive transients and leak currents were subtracted by using a P/5 protocol with a holding potential of Ϫ120 mV.

Chemical Modification. MTSET ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide) and MTSEA (2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Downsview, Canada). An aliquot of 100 mM MTS reagents stock solution was thawed and diluted 500-fold into the basal internal solution immediately before use. In ionic current recordings, currents were recorded after 2.5 min of MTS reagents treatment and 0.5 min of washing of patches with the inside-out configurations. In gating current recordings, MTSET was added directly into the bath.

Data Analysis. For macroscopic current, relative conductance was determined by measuring tail current amplitudes at Ϫ80 mV. The gating charge movements were determined by integrating the area under the rising phase and single exponential fits to the decaying phase of IgON at various voltages. The conductance-voltage (G-V) relations or the charge-voltage (Qc-V) relations of the WT and mutant channels were fitted with the Boltzmann equation:

G/GMax ϭ 1/͑1 ϩ exp͑Ϫze͑ V Ϫ V1/2͒/kT͒͒

[4]

or

Q/QMax ϭ 1/͑1 ϩ exp͑ϪzJe͑ V Ϫ VhC͒/kT͒͒.

[5]

In Eq. 4, z is the number of equivalent charges, V1/2 is the voltage for channel in half-activation, e is the elementary charge, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute temperature. In Eq. 5, zJ is the gating charge associated with voltage sensor movement, Vhc is the voltage for half of the gating charge movements at the closed conformation of the channel, and the other parameters are as in Eq.

4. The data were obtained from n ϭ 4–16 patches. Error bars represent the SEM in all figures.

HCA Model Fitting. Po-V relation at negative voltages, G-V and Qc-V relations at 0 [Ca2ϩ]i were fitted to Eq. 6 derived from the HCA model (33),

Ͳͩ ͩ ͪ ͪ Po ϭ 1

1 ϩ exp͑zJF͑V Ϫ Vhc͒͒ 1 ϩ exp͑zJF͑V Ϫ Vho͒͒

exp͑ Ϫ zLFV/RT͒

,

[6]

where Vhc and Vho are the voltages for half of the gating charge movements at the closed and the open conformation, respectively; zJ is the gating charge associated with voltage sensor movement; L0 is the intrinsic equilibrium constant for the activation gate, and zL is the charge associated with channel opening.
Our results indicate that mutation Q397R shifts the Qo-V relation via changing the local voltage sensed by R213. R213 is likely to be located in the crevice among the VSD, pore and cytosolic domains and exposed to the aqueous solution when interacting with R397, which is located at the border between a low dielectric (protein of the cytosolic domain) and a high dielectric (water in the crevice) medium. Thus, the distance between the charges of R213 and R397, r ϭ 9.1 Å, can be calculated from the following equation (42, 43):

ex p͑ Ϫ␬ r ͒

␺R ϭ 2e 4␲␧0␧rr ,

[7]

where ⌿R ϭ 0.58*⌬V1/2, ⌬V1/2 is the the Qo-V shift (Ϫ24 mV; Fig. 3 f and g ), e is the elementary charge, ␧r is the dielectric constant of water, ␧0 is the permittivity of free space, and 1/␬ (8.07 Å) is the
Debye length in the aqueous phase and is calculated as in ref. 26.

Structural Model. The structure of Mg2ϩ binding site of the mSlo1 channel was generated based on the crystal structure of the MthK channel by using the PyMol molecular graphics system (www. pymol.org).
