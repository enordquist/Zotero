One of thc principal moti vatio ns for stud ying proteins by

nuclear magnetic resona nce stems from the desire to describe

the Solillion structure o f t hese mo lecules as compared to the

generally perceived static picture obtained by X-ray crystal-

lograph y. Indeed. il is onc of the unique feat u res of N MR

spectroscopy that in addition to structural data. dyna mic

propenies can be probed and charactcrized by measuring

relaxatio n parameters. Furt herm ore. a ny mobility of the

protein in soluti on will necessa rily mod ulate the measured

NMR parameters and should in nuence the resulti ng struc-

ture. It has been argued that regions o f a protei n that are

highly mobile would be expected to be defi ned to a lesser

degree o fprcdsion than regions that are rigid (/ . 2 ).

T he structures of protci ns determined by NMR are based

o n the calculatio n of a large ensemble of structu res, where

each structure is compatible wi th the experimental NMR
data. comprising principall y sho rt « 5 A) approx imate in-

in t he ensem ble represe nts an equall y good descriptio n o f

the " true mean" structure. Because the nuclcar O vcrhauser

the re-

sulting interproto n d istance restraints are ( r-t! ) - lit! averdges.

Hence. the mean structure that is probed by N MR is not a n

ari thmctic mean of a ll the co nfo rmations present in solution
but an ( , 6) - 1/6 mean . The precisio n o f the struct ure de-

terminatio n is dependen t on thc number and d istributio n

residue NOEs to be attenuated resulting in rewer interproton
distance restraints with larger upper bounds and carre· spondingly larger ( rmsd.,.m) values. Motion, however, that is slower than the correlation time has no effect on 5 2, but may increase the value or ( rmOO.,._", ) , reflecting multiple

conrormations within particular regions or the molecule.
Taking the abO\'e into account. it would be inappropriate to expect a perrect correlation between S ~ and ( rmsdx_m ); indeed. the finding or a general trend is a pleasing result. It is
also important to note that an exhaustive and accurate anal-

ysis of the NMR data is a necessary prerequisite for the above relat ionship to be of general validit y. Incom plete analysis of the NMR spectra, misassignments of NOEs, and inappropriate boundary limits will result in relati vely large ( rmsd.,_", ) values. Therefore. eve n tho ugh the mObility of a protein region may possibly be inferred from the relati ve values o f ( rmsd .._", ) in high-resolution NMR structures. it is o nly the values ofS! that can accurately determine local mobility.
A plot of backbone S 2versus crystallographic B factors is
presented in Fig. I C. An inverse correlation would intuitively be expected si nce high mobility in solut io n as evidenced by a low 5 2 would man ifest itself by random thermal motions or static con formational disorder in the crystal lattice, re-
sulting in large B fa ctors. Although a trend in this regard
may be inferred fro m the data. the large degree of scatter indicates that additional factors heavily influence this sim ple
relationship. Indeed . a small 51 value does not necessari ly result in a large 8 factor since regions in volved in crystal
contacts will be restricted in their thermal motions in the lattice but frequ ently exhi bit a considerable degree of mobility in solution. Conversely. large S 1 values in regions involved in slow exchange between different conformations could result in large B factors instead o f the pred icted small values because of the inability to differentiate between multiple confonners in the crystal ( i.e.. static disorder ). Likewise, the relationsh ip between the ( rmsd "_m) and 8 factors is a complex one. Although. in general. regions which arc well defined in the solution structure will correspond to regio ns exh ibiting small 8 factors in the X-ray structure, the reverse is not necessarily true and detailed comparisons must be carried out for each individual case.
Gi ven the above relationships, one can onl y conclude that the precision of the backbone coordinates on a resid ue-byresid ue basis observed in high-resolution protein NMR structures is approximately correlated to backbo ne mobility in solution (52). A similar type of approx imate correlation is also observed between B factors and coordinate precision in X·ray structu res ( f7). This observation is reassuri ng since it indicates that in regio ns of high mobili ty the precision of the NMR solution coordinates is correspond ingly reduced. Indeed. the observati on of overly precise coordinates in regions of high mobility (either 5 2 -E 0.4 or significant confonnational heterogeneit y as evidenced by T 2exchange line broadening) can be taken as indicative of the presence of errors in the interproton distance restraints in such regions ( e.g.. misassignmcnts. upper bounds that are too low, d is-tance ranges that are too restrictive). Conversely, reduced precision in regions that arc nol particularly mobile is indicative of a lack of an appropriate num ber of distance re-

st raints. fo r example, due to incomplete assignments o f the NOE cross peaks in mu ltidi mensional spectra. It cannot, however. be emphasized enough that the ( rmsd,_m) does not provide a measure of the magnitude o f the conformational space sampled by a protein in solution. Rather it simply reflects the precision with wh ic h the mean ( r - f» - l lh solution coordinates have been determ ined. Thus. broadly speak ing, 5 2, together with chemical-exchange line broadening, is the solution equi valent of the crystallographic B factor. and the ( rmsd.,.", ) for an e nsemb le of N MR struct ures is equivalent to the precision of the crystal1 0gmphic coordinates. as obtained from independe nt X-ray structure determinations of the sa me crystal form .
