The 70-kilodalton (kDa) heat-shock proteins (Hsp70s) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones essential for cellular protein folding and proteostasis. Each Hsp70 has two functional domains: a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), which binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and a substrate-binding domain (SBD), which binds extended polypeptides. NBD and SBD interact little when in the presence of ADP; however, ATP binding allosterically couples the polypeptide- and ATP-binding sites. ATP binding promotes polypeptide release; polypeptide rebinding stimulates ATP hydrolysis. This allosteric coupling is poorly understood. Here we present the crystal structure of an intact ATP-bound Hsp70 from Escherichia coli at 1.96-Å resolution. The ATP-bound NBD adopts a unique conformation, forming extensive interfaces with an SBD that has changed radically, having its a-helical lid displaced and the polypeptide-binding channel of its b-subdomain restructured. These conformational changes, together with our biochemical assays, provide a structural explanation for allosteric coupling in Hsp70 activity.

Maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is a fundamental
task for all living organisms, and in humans, failure to do so con-
tributes to destructive diseases, such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders1,2. By assisting protein folding, assembly, degradation
and transport across membranes, the Hsp70 proteins are key players
in proteostasis.
Hsp70s are highly conserved. Each contains two functional
domains, an NBD and an SBD, which are joined by a short linker segment3–5 (Fig. 1a). NBD is an ATPase and SBD substrates are extended hydrophobic polypeptides like those that occur in unfolded proteins6.
The first NBD structure was of NBD isolated from bovine Hsc70, which has ADP bound at a site between two lobes7 (lobe I and lobe II),
and all subsequent Hsp70 structures have been either ADP-bound or nucleotide-free8–11. The first SBD structure was of the SBD isolated from the E. coli Hsp70 DnaK in complex with a short peptide12. Other known SBD structures have essentially the same conformation10,11,13–15,
with the polypeptide-binding site more dynamic in solution in the absence of peptide substrate14.
Although NBD and SBD can each bind its substrate independ-
ently, the chaperone activity of Hsp70s strictly requires tight coupling
of these two domains upon ATP binding. Various biochemical and
structural studies, mainly of DnaK as a model Hsp70, have shown
that in ADP-bound or nucleotide-free states there is little contact
between NBD and SBD; each domain acts independently as though isolated11,16–18. In contrast, upon ATP binding, the affinity of SBD for its substrates is reduced by two to three orders of magnitude19,20.
Rates of both binding and release are greatly accelerated, but release

is more so than binding. Reciprocally, polypeptide binding to SBD stimulates ATP hydolysis3,20. This allosteric coupling ensures that energy from ATP hydrolysis is efficiently used to control peptide substrate binding and release for efficient chaperone activity. Despite extensive efforts, the basic mechanism of this ATP-induced allosteric coupling is still poorly defined.
Crystal structures of full-length Hsp70s containing both functional domains in the ATP-bound state have been highly sought in anticipation of insight into Hsp70 allostery. This goal has proven challenging, however, because of ATP lability and the transience of allosteric coupling. In fact, even structures of isolated ATP-bound NBDs are elusive7,8,21,22. Hsp110s are distant homologs of Hsp70s, and our structure of ATP-bound Sse1 (Sse1-ATP), a yeast Hsp110, provided an invaluable starting point for mechanistic understanding of allo­ steric coupling in Hsp70s (refs. 4,5,23–27); however, its applicability to Hsp70s is limited, owing to relatively low sequence conservation, especially between SBD regions23. To explore the molecular mechanism of this essential ATP-induced allosteric coupling, we solved a crystal structure of an intact Hsp70 from E. coli in complex with ATP. Our biochemical analysis inspired by this structure provides a mechanistic understanding of how ATP binding allosterically opens the polypeptide-binding site.
RESULTS Hsp70 DnaK locked in an ATP-bound state To study a functionally complete Hsp70 in the ATP-bound state, we incorporated two previously reported mutations into E. coli DnaK:

T199A and loop L3,4 alternative L′3,4 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). T199A is a well-characterized mutation that abolishes ATPase activity but maintains allosteric coupling16,28; it helped to stabilize
Hsp70 in a relevant ATP-bound state. DnaK tends to self-associate into flexible oligomers29, which complicates crystallization. Recently,
we produced a peptide-binding–deficient DnaK mutant in which
peptide-binding loop L3,4 was replaced by a shortened L1,2 sequence (TAEDNQS→MGG)30; this modification solved the self-association
problem. Furthermore, to facilitate crystallization, we removed 28 residues at the extreme C-terminal region, which is disordered18,31. The resulting construct was designated DnaK-T199A L′3,4.
To investigate the structural impact of the L′3,4 modification, we solved the crystal structure of an isolated SBD variant of DnaK carrying this modification (SBD-L′3,4) at 1.62-Å resolution (Fig. 1b and Table 1). SBD comprises two subdomains: SBDβ forms a single polypeptide-binding channel between loops L1,2 and L3,4, and SBDα functions as a lid covering the polypeptide-binding site on SBDβ12
(Fig. 1c). A short model peptide substrate (NRLLLTG) is bound in
the polypeptide-binding site in the isolated wild-type SBD structure. Except for the shortening of L3,4 by four residues, SBD-L′3,4 is almost identical to the previously solved wild-type SBD structure12 (0.45 Å r.m.s. deviation in SBDβ Cα atoms). SBDα is rotated slightly (Fig. 1c), consistent with the intrinsic flexibility of this region12,15.
Substrate peptides bind too weakly to the DnaK protein carrying the

L′3,4 ­mutation (DnaK-L′3,4) to be detected by fluorescence anisotropy assays30; however, the linker segment from a symmetry mate binds to SBD-L′3,4 at the high concentrations in crystals, similarly to how the model peptide binds wild-type SBD (Fig. 1b,c).
To investigate the functional impact of the T199A and L′3,4 mutations, we used a well-established tryptophan fluorescence assay of allo­ steric coupling. DnaK has a single tryptophan, Trp102 in NBD, whose intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum is sensitive to the nucleotidebinding state. Relative to the apo and ADP-bound forms, ATP binding induces blueshift and fluorescence quenching, but only in the context of full-length DnaK when there is allosteric coupling16. Tryptophanfluorescence changes upon ATP addition were almost identical for DnaK-T199A L′3,4 as for wild-type DnaK (Fig. 1d). Thus, this variant has a wild-type–like conformation in the ATP-bound state.
Crystals of DnaK-T199A L′3,4 grew only in the presence of ATP. Hereafter, we refer to the complex as DnaK-ATP. The crystals diffract well and have two DnaK chains per asymmetric unit (Table 1). We solved the structure by multi-crystal native single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD)32. Resulting electron density maps were of high quality, showing well-defined Mg2+-ATP ligands (Supplementary Fig. 2) and allowing automated model building. Separately collected native data were used for refinement at 1.96-Å resolution. The final model had excellent stereochemistry (no Ramachandran outliers).
The two crystallographically unique DnaK-ATP protomers were almost identical (Cα r.m.s. deviation = 0.40 Å; all-atom r.m.s. ­deviation = 0.82 Å), related by near-dyad symmetry (rotation χ = 179.9°; translation tχ = 0.15Å) (Fig. 2a). Each protomer was composed of familiar NBD, linker, SBDβ and SBDα domains and ATP; however, domains were disposed uniquely (Fig. 2b) with extensive interfaces and unanticipated conformational changes. Thus, the DnaKATP structure gives a first view of a full-length, ATP-bound Hsp70.
Comparison to Hsp70-ADP and Hsp110-ATP
The DnaK-ATP structure is radically different from ADP-bound and nucleotide-free Hsp70 structures10,11,18, wherein NBD and SBD are mostly independent, both structurally and functionally; however, it shares similarities with the Sse1-ATP structure. NMR analysis of DnaK-ADP showed a distribution of orientations for SBD relative to NBD and produced an average solution structure using X-ray crystal structures for the domains18 (Fig. 2c).
Various biochemical and NMR studies have suggested that NBD and SBD contact one another in the presence of ATP3–5,16,17,33. Consistent with these observations, we found numerous contacts between domains of DnaK-ATP (Fig. 2b), which involve substantial conformational change within the NBD and the SBD. In summary, SBDα is peeled away from the polypeptide-binding site on SBDβ, as seen in the isolated SBD structure (and adopted in the DnaK-ADP model)18. SBDα docks onto the lobe I side of NBD, and subdomain SBDβ binds between lobe I and lobe II at the lower backside (in the canonical view) of NBD (Fig. 2b). The two lobes of NBD move apart such that the linker fits into the cleft between them; and, consistent with its essential role in allosteric coupling17,34–36, the linker then extends directly into SBDβ. Thus, the overall conformation of DnaKATP was completely different from that of DnaK-ADP (Fig. 2c).
The NBD-SBD interfaces and the relative orientation of the domains in DnaK-ATP agree well with many previous biochemical and biophysical studies, including a number of recent studies using NMR and FRET24–27,35–37. Notably, this structure provides a direct explanation for the well-established tryptophan-fluorescence shifts that accompany ATP-induced allosteric coupling in DnaK16. The Sse1-ATP structure already hinted at this explanation, but the

Other Hsp70 NBD structures have been in either the ADP-bound or the nucleotide-free state4,5,7–11,21, and NBD of DnaK-ATP was substantially different from those (Fig. 3a). It does resemble the ATP-bound conformation of Sse1-ATP23 (Cα r.m.s. deviation = 1.54 Å; Fig. 3b). Indeed, the Mg2+-ATP complexes were virtually identical in the two structures (Supplementary Fig. 4c).

expected from biochemical analyses of the yeast Hsp110 structure, Sse1-ATP23, and it supports the hypothesis that Sse1-ATP is an evolutionary vestige of the Hsp70-ATP state23 with some shared char-

increased solvent accessibility of these loops in solution17,38. This conformational change that accompanies ATP binding to DnaK, whereby the polypeptide-binding channel is opened, could be the structural basis for allosteric coupling in Hsp70 chaperones generally.
Consistent with the DnaK-ATP structure, an NMR study of isolated apo-SBDβ, DnaK (393–507) without peptide substrate, has shown that peptide-binding loops L3,4 and L5,6 are flexible and dynamic14. L3,4 and L5,6 in the NMR structure of apo-SBDβ were positioned somewhere in between their positions in the DnaK-ATP and isolated SBD-peptide structures (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). The ­polypeptidebinding loops in DnaK-ATP made contacts with symmetry mates in the crystal lattice (Supplementary Fig. 5e,f). Thus, it is possible that loops L3,4 and L5,6 are dynamic in the ATP-bound state, as in isolated apo-SBDβ, and that lattice contacts stabilize a flipped-out member of an ensemble of ATP-bound conformations. To estimate how much crystal contacts might have affected the conformation of these loops, we carried out molecular dynamic simulations without crystal contacts, and found that SBDβ was the most stable element in the DnaK-ATP structure and was much more stable than other SBDβ structures; apo-SBDβ was the least stable (Supplementary Fig. 5g). Stabilizing contacts permeate the β-strands of SBDβ in DnaK-ATP, which differed markedly from those in the isolated SBD structure12 (Fig. 3c). Loops L3,4 and L5,6 emanated in an opened trajectory from these strands as stabilized by NBD-SBD interfaces, and we conclude that flexibility is limited to tips of the loops. Disulfide cross-linking experiments confirmed that DnaK-ATP in solution is similar to the crystal structure (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, NBD-SBD interfaces

generated upon binding of ATP fix the bases of L3,4 and L5,6 in SBDβ in an open conformation that is incompatible with strong peptide binding. The tips of loops may remain flexible, consistent with previous NMR studies14,39; however, unlike those of apo or peptide-bound SBDβ domains, the ensemble of states for DnaK-ATP is predisposed toward open conformations.
Conformational impact of conserved glycine residues on L5,6 To test the hypothesis that the opening of the polypeptide-binding channel upon ATP binding could be responsible for polypeptide release, we examined residues on L5,6. We found that two highly conserved residues, Gly461 and Gly468, changed backbone conformations dramatically (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 1), whereas other residues showed only moderate changes. We made glycine-to-proline mutations G461P and G468P because proline residues allow the phi and psi conformational angles of DnaK-ATP but not of isolated SBD40, the ADP state (Fig. 2c); thus, these mutants are designed to locally restrict SBDβ to its conformation in the ATP-bound state independent of ATP-induced domain contacts. Mutation of either glycine residue individually compromised in vivo DnaK function modestly, but mutation of both (DnaKPP) abolished DnaK function (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 6a), despite wild-type levels of expression (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Tests with yeast Hsp70 Ssa1 gave similar results, suggesting a universal importance in Hsp70s (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 6a).
To test impact of the DnaK-PP mutation on specific characteristics of DnaK activity, we purified the mutant protein for in vitro activity assays. We found that the chaperone activity of wild-type DnaK in refolding

of heat-denatured luciferase is lost for the DnaK-PP mutant (Fig. 4c). Moreover, we found that peptide binding to DnaK-PP is aberrant. Unlike the wild-type protein in the presence of ADP or the absence of nucleotides, where binding affinity is high and binding kinetics are slow, DnaK-PP bound substrate peptides with reduced affinity (Fig. 4d) and fast binding kinetics (Fig. 4e), as happens for wild-type DnaK in ATP19. DnaK-PP underwent normal ATP-induced NBD-SBD associations as measured by tryptophan fluorescence. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that SBDβ of DnaK-PP is locked locally into an ATP-like conformation, irrespectively of the ATP or ADP status of the NBD. Thus, the two L5,6 glycine residues are crucial for ATPinduced conformational changes in SBDβ. In summary, our results from molecular dynamic simulations, disulfide cross-linking and the

DnaK-PP mutant analysis suggest that a flipped-out conformation of L3,4 and L5,6 in DnaK-ATP is physiologically important even though crystal contacts may stabilize one of an ensemble of states.
Domain interfaces in allosteric coupling The unique conformation of DnaK-ATP arises from extensive interfaces that form between domains as they adapt to ATP binding. There are three major interdomain contacts: NBD-linker, NBD-SBDβ and NBD-SBDα (Fig. 2b). The interfacial surfaces are conserved among Hsp70s (Fig. 5), and especially so in the crucial NBD-SBDβ interface. SBDβ has additional conservation at the polypeptide­binding channel (Fig. 5b). Large surface areas are buried in the interfaces; however, shape complementarity is low compared to similar

ONLINE METHODS Protein expression and purification. The DnaK-T199A L′3,4 (residues 2–610) and SBD-L′3,4 (residues 388–610) constructs were cloned into a pSMT3 vector and expressed as Smt3 fusion proteins in E. coli BL21(DE3) Gold cells. pSMT vector is a generous gift from C. Lima49. The fusion proteins were first purified on a HisTrap column. After the Smt3 tag was removed by Ulp1 protease, the DnaK proteins were separated from the Smt3 tag using a HisTrap column and further purified using a HiTrap Q and Superdex 200 16/60 column. The Ulp1 cleavage introduces a serine residue, effectively generating an M1S mutation. All the columns are from GE Healthcare. The purified proteins were concentrated to 30–50 mg/ml in a buffer containing 5 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and 10 mM KCl and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
All of the DnaK mutant proteins used in the biochemical assays were cloned into the dnak expression plasmid pBB46 and expressed in the dnak deletion strain BB205 (camRkanR)50. To facilitate purification, a His6 tag was fused to the C terminus (addition of this tag has no observable influence on the in vivo function of DnaK). Proteins were purified as described previously36. Briefly, after being purified by HisTrap column, each protein was further purified on a HiTrap Q column. Before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, each protein was concentrated to 10–50 mg/ml. The purification of DnaJ and GrpE was essentially as described previously30,37.
Crystallization, data collection and model building. For the DnaK-T199A L′3,4 protein, crystals were grown at 4 °C in 1.8–2.0 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M HEPESNaOH (pH 7.5) and 2–3% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400. Crystals of SBD-L′3,4 were grown at 20 °C in 2.0 M (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Both crystals were cryoprotected with 15% glycerol in mother liquor and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All diffraction data sets were collected at the X4A and X4C beamlines of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. To enhance anomalous signals from native DnaK-T199A L′3,4 crystals, we tuned the wavelength of beamline X4A to the Fe K-edge (λ = 1.743 Å, E = 7.112 keV) as verified by fluorescence scan. Anomalous diffraction data sets from five crystals were integrated by XDS51 and scaled by SCALA52. We collected and processed a higher-resolution native data set at a wavelength of 0.979 Å using beamline X4C. Data collection and reduction statistics for native and multi-crystal single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data sets are listed in Table 1.
We used the multi-crystal native-SAD method32 for structure determination based on S, P and Mg anomalous scatterers (51 sites for 1,212 residues). Briefly, we enhanced anomalous signals by analyzing, scaling and merging anomalous signals from five crystals. Anomalous scatter substructure was determined by SHELXD53. The substructure was refined and completed for phase calculation using Phaser54. The phases were then density modified by DM55 to break the phase ambiguity, and this resulted in electron density maps of sufficient quality for automated model building with Arp/wArp56. Although noncrystallographic two-fold symmetry is present, such information was not required for native-SAD phasing. Further refinement and model building were carried out using Phenix57 and COOT58. Multi-crystal SAD data and the 1.96-Å resolution native data were used for refinements. The refined model was validated by PROCHECK59 and Molprobity60 to assess geometry. All residues are in favored regions with no Ramachandran outliers.
To solve the structure of SBD-L′3,4, a diffraction data set at 1.62-Å resolution from a single crystal was collected at wavelength 0.979 Å at Beamline X4C, integrated and scaled by HKL2000 (ref. 61). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of isolated DnaK SBD (1DKZ) as search model. Model building, refinement and validation of SBD-L′3,4 followed the same protocol as for the full-length DnaK.
Tryptophan fluorescence assay. The assay was performed as described previously36. Briefly, DnaK proteins were diluted to 1 µM in buffer A (25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol and 2 mM DTT). ATP or ADP (5 µl 200 mM) was added to 1 ml DnaK protein solution, and the mixture was incubated for 2 min. Emission spectra were collected from 310 nm to 400 nm on a PC1 Photon Counting Spectrofluorimeter from ISS (Illinois, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The peak reading of the ADP spectrum of each protein was set as 1, and the relative fluorescence was plotted versus wavelength. The blueshift

for each protein was calculated as the difference in emission maximums between the spectra in the presence and absence of ATP.
Site-directed mutagenesis and growth tests. All DnaK and Ssa1 mutations were introduced using the QuikChange Lightening Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Growth tests were performed as described previously23, with some modifications. For growth tests in DnaK, pBB46 plasmids (ampR) carrying mutant dnak were transformed into a dnak deletion strain BB205 (camRkanR)50. Because E. coli growth is dependent on a functional DnaK at 37 °C but not at 30 °C, growth tests were carried out at 37 °C, and control tests were performed at 30 °C. For each mutant, a fresh overnight culture was prepared from a fresh transformation. Five-microliter serial dilutions of the overnight cultures were spotted on LB plates containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin, 25 µg/ml kanamycin, 25 µg/ml chloramphenicol and 20 µM IPTG and incubated overnight at 37 °C to evaluate growth.
All of the Ssa1 mutants were cloned into an Ssa1-expressing plasmid, pRS313SSA1, and transformed into a SSA1 mutant yeast strain JB67 (ref. 62). Besides harboring deletions of SSA2-4, JB67 carries a temperature-sensitive SSA1 mutant, ssa1-45, and thus is unable to grow at 37 °C. Ten-microliter serial dilutions of fresh overnight cultures from fresh transformations were spotted onto yeast minimum medium plates lacking histidine. Growth was scored after incubating at 37 °C for 2–3 d. Growth tests at 30 °C were used as controls.
Luciferase refolding assay. Purified firefly luciferase was purchased from Promega. Before denaturing at 42 °C for 20 min, luciferase was diluted in buffer B (25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) 100 mM KCl, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM DTT and 3 mM ATP) to a final concentration of 100 nM in the presence of indicated DnaK proteins (3 µM). To start refolding reactions, a reaction mixture containing DnaK (3 µM), DnaJ (0.67 µM) and GrpE (0.33 µM) was added to heat-denatured luciferase. At indicated time points, 2 µl of refolding reaction was mixed with 50 µl luciferase substrate, and luciferase activity was read in a Berthold LB9507 luminometer.
Fluorescence anisotropy assay of peptide substrate binding affinity and ­kinetics. NR peptide (sequence: NRLLLTG) labeled with fluorescein at the N terminus (F-NR) was obtained at purity >95% from NEOBioscience. To determine binding affinity, serial dilutions of DnaK proteins were incubated with F-NR (20 nM final concentration) in buffer A for at least 3 h to reach equilibrium. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out on a Beacon 2000 instrument (Invitrogen). To calculate dissociation constants (Kd), data were fitted to a one-site binding equation using PRISM (GraphPad, http://www.graphpad. com/prism/). Each sample was read at least three times, and each DnaK protein was repeated at least two times with more than two different protein preparations. For binding-kinetics measurements, 10 µM of DnaK protein was incubated with indicated nucleotide for 2 min, then F-NR was added to start the binding reaction. Anisotropy was read every 10 s.
Molecular dynamic simulation analysis. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were carried out using GROMACS63. Simulations for each structure were carried out for 20 ns without consideration of crystal contacts or symmetry mates. Principal component analysis with G_COVAR64 on the conformations collected by MD simulations was used to calculate the raw covariance matrix in three dimensions for each pair of Cα atoms. To systematically survey the strength of all contacts, we used the normalized covariance factor (scale, 0–1), which is also called cross-correlation65. The higher the normalized covariance factor, the more stable a contact is.
