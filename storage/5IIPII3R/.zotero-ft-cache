ABSTRACT

Due to its clinical relevance, modulation of functionally relevant amino acids in protein-protein complexes has attracted a great deal of attention. To this end, many approaches have been proposed to predict partner-selecting, i.e., specificity-determining positions in evolutionarily close complexes. These approaches can be grouped into sequence-based machine learning and structure-based energy-driven methods. In this work, we assessed these methods’ ability to map the specificity-determining positions of Axl, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cancer progression and immune-related diseases. For this, we used three sequence-based predictors – SDPred, Multi-RELIEF, and Sequence Harmony – and a structure-based approach by utilizing HADDOCK and extensive molecular dynamics simulations. As a result, we show that (i) sequence-based methods overpredict the number of specificity-determining positions for Axl complexes and that (ii) combining sequence-based approaches with HADDOCK provides the most coherent set of predictions. Our work lays out a critical study on the comparative performance specificity-determining position predictors. It also presents a combined sequence-structure-based approach, which can guide the development of therapeutic molecules capable of combatting Axl misregulation in different types of diseases.

* The Clinical Trials and Epidemiology subject categories are now closed to new submissions following the completion of bioRxiv's clinical research pilot project and launch of the dedicated health sciences server medRxiv (submit.medrxiv.org) . New papers that report results of Clinical Trials must now be submitted to medRxiv. Most new Epidemiology papers also should be submitted to medRxiv, but if a paper contains no health-related information, authors may choose to submit it to another bioRxiv subject category (e.g., Genetics or Microbiology).
