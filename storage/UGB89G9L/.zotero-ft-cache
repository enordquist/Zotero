In macromolecular crystallography, the agreement between observed and predicted structure factors (Rcryst and Rfree) is seldom better than 20%. This is much larger than the estimate of experimental error (Rmerge). The difference between Rcryst and Rmerge is the R-factor gap. There is no such gap in small-molecule crystallography, for which calculated structure factors are generally considered more accurate than the experimental measurements. Perhaps the true noise level of macromolecular data is higher than expected? Or is the gap caused by inaccurate phases that trap reﬁned models in local minima? By generating simulated diffraction patterns using the program MLFSOM, and including every conceivable source of experimental error, we show that neither is the case. Processing our simulated data yielded values that were indistinguishable from those of real data for all crystallographic statistics except the ﬁnal Rcryst and Rfree. These values decreased to 3.8% and 5.5% for simulated data, suggesting that the reason for high R-factors in macromolecular crystallography is neither experimental error nor phase bias, but rather an underlying inadequacy in the models used to explain our observations. The present inability to accurately represent the entire macromolecule with both its ﬂexibility and its proteinsolvent interface may be improved by synergies between small-angle X-ray scattering, computational chemistry and crystallography. The exciting implication of our ﬁnding is that macromolecular data contain substantial hidden and untapped potential to resolve ambiguities in the true nature of the nanoscale, a task that the second century of crystallography promises to fulﬁll.

The R-factor gap in macromolecular crystallography

Introduction
Realistic simulation of X-ray diffraction experiments requires a return to ﬁrst principles. Currently, there are so many scale factors and corrections that any connection between the ﬁnal coordinate model and the value of a given pixel on the detector is easily lost, but, in the early days of X-ray crystallography, this relationship was at the forefront of research. Not long after the discovery of X-rays by Ro€ntgen in 1895, he was awarded the ﬁrst ever Nobel Prize (in 1901), but the properties of this new kind of ‘ray’ were still not well understood. Indeed, Rutherford had only just divided nuclear radiations into three categories (alpha, beta and gamma), and it was by no means clear that Thomson’s ‘cathode rays’ (1887) and Rutherford’s ‘beta rays’ were both electrons, or that naturally produced gamma rays and machine-produced X-rays were both electromagnetic radiation. Indeed, at that time, it was still debated whether ordinary visible light was a particle or a wave, let alone the newly discovered ‘X-rays’. It was not even clear that crystals were regular arrays of atoms, and the internal structure of the atom itself was still a mystery.
Despite this apparent chaos and confusion, precise measurements were being made. Although W.L. Bragg is now famously known for formulating the ﬁrst equation relating the position of spots to distances inside the crystal, his father W.H. Bragg is perhaps less well known for his work on X-ray detectors. Ro€ntgen found that X-rays darken photographic ﬁlm, but, especially in those days, this process was far from quantiﬁable or linear. Building on the work of Perrin [1] and Barkla [2], Bragg and son used what today is called an ion chamber as the detector for their famous work on rock salt [3]. The ion chamber is an amazing linear device that directly converts the intensity of an X-ray beam into an electric current. Even in those days, electric currents could be measured extremely reliably, the basis of the ammeter having been discovered nearly a century earlier by Schweigger and Ampere [4,5].
It was such precise measurements with this very device [6] that enabled Charles G. Darwin (not to be confused with his famous grandfather Charles R. Darwin, author of the 1859 book On the Origin of Species) to extend Maxwell’s dynamical theory of electromagnetism to X-rays [7]. Incidentally, Darwin’s lab partner, Henry Moseley, also obtained the ﬁrst experimental evidence that the atomic numbers proposed by Mendeleev (1869) had any physical signiﬁcance. They corresponded beautifully to the wavelength of X-rays emitted by chemical elements when bombarded with highenergy radiations [8]. Until this discovery, acceptance of

the periodic table had been slow because it could not explain the systematic discrepancies between atomic number and atomic mass. The neutron was unknown at that time, as it was discovered by Chadwick 19 years later [9].
Although the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction came ﬁrst, Darwin spent the following nine years revising it to account for imperfect crystals, largely because the dynamical theory was not consistent with Moseley’s observations of diffracted intensities. The crystals available at that time were just not perfect enough for dynamical theory to work, much like the protein crystals of today. Darwin’s follow-up work was the ﬁrst to deﬁne a variable called f to represent the effect of the structure contained within the unit cell [7]. Hartree clariﬁed the signiﬁcance of this concept [10], much to the delight of W.L. Bragg, who expounded on its usefulness [11]. Interestingly, the concept of a structure factor had ﬁrst been proposed almost a decade previously by Debye and Scherrer [12], but the idea did not make its way into the English literature until well after the end of World War I. Indeed, the ﬁeld of crystallography began to make tremendous leaps forward as soon as scientists from both sides of that conﬂict ﬁnally began to communicate.
It is Darwin’s master formula predicting the number of photons in a fully recorded spot given the intensity of the incident beam, camera parameters, a few physical constants, and the all-important ‘structure factor’ that enabled the present work. A modernized version of Darwin’s formula has been described by Blundell and Johnson [13], and has been instructively re-derived by Woolfson [14].
Speciﬁcally, the formula used here is identical to that given by Holton and Frankel [15]:

where I is the integrated spot intensity (in photons/
spot), Ibeam is the intensity of the incident beam (photonsÁsÀ1ÁmÀ2), re is the classical electron radius (2.818 9 10À15 m), Vxtal is the volume of the crystal (in m3), Vcell is the volume of the crystal unit cell (in m3), k is the X-ray wavelength (in m), x is the angular velocity of the crystal (radiansÁsÀ1), L is the Lorentz
factor (speed/speed), P is the polarization factor (pho-
tons/photons), A is the X-ray transmittance of the
path through the crystal to the spot (photons/pho-
tons), and F is the structure factor (electron equiva-
lents).
Previously we explained how this formula gives
intensities on an absolute scale [15]. In the present

work, we are concerned with the error associated with this intensity, and the above formula is a useful guide to this error propagation. Any relative error in any of the terms in Eqn (1) propagates directly into a relative error in the spot intensity. For example, if Vxtal is 5% off, then so will I be. If Ibeam ﬂuctuates by 5%, that error too propagates into I, as would a 5% ﬂuctuation in the speed of the motor driving the spindle. Uncertainties in the attenuation factor A due to the odd shape of the crystal and vitriﬁed solution around it also propagate into the data as absorption errors, and even a slight mis-alignment of the spindle with the beam may cause a very large change in the Lorentz factor.
Many of these sources of error may be removed by scaling, because, as long as the incident beam intensity, for example, is always 10% lower than expected, all of the spot intensities will be off by exactly the same amount. This means that no inaccuracy is propagated into the ﬁnal electron density map, which may be placed on an absolute scale by comparing it to the calculated map [16]. However, if the incident beam intensity changes during the course of data collection, then the scale factor must be made to follow it exactly, or the error in the scale factor itself will propagate into the data. In general, scaling may be used to remove sources of error with low frequencies, such as the variation in illuminated volume as the crystal rotates, but cannot remove errors with high frequencies, such as the variation in illuminated volume as the crystal vibrates in the cryo stream [17].
Because of the complex ways that data processing may suppress certain sources of error and not others, the only way to deﬁnitively evaluate the inﬂuence of all sources of error is to simulate the diffraction experiment and calibrate the magnitude and frequency of all sources of error on a real-world instrument. To this end, we developed MLFSOM, a program for generating simulated diffraction images given a set of structure factors and a parameterized list of experimental variables. A detailed description of the implementation of this program is provided as Doc S1. The name MLFSOM was chosen because it performs the reverse operation of data-processing programs such as MOSFLM [18], but the simulation is based on ﬁrst principles and is not speciﬁc to MOSFLM, HKL2000 [19] or XDS [20]. Unlike previous diffraction image simulators [21–23], implementation of MLFSOM has focused on putting both signal and noise on an absolute scale, enabling direct, side-by-side comparison with real data.
In performing this exercise, we followed in the footsteps of those early pioneers who were also devising models that could quantitatively predict experimental

data. However, detector technology has come a long way since the seminal rock salt experiment by Bragg and son, and thus the information needed to create a simulator spans nearly 100 years of literature. In addition, each source of noise implemented in MLFSOM was calibrated by independent experimental measurements. For example, correct estimation of the photoncounting error requires that the data be placed on an absolute scale because this is the only scale on which the error in the count is the square root of the intensity. For counting devices such as multi-wire or pixel array detectors, the pile-up correction and its appropriateness to the time structure of the incoming signal is also a source of error [24], but as we are only concerned here with a CCD detector, this source of error was not implemented. Sources of error such as shutter jitter, beam ﬂicker and irregular spot shape are proportional to the signal, and therefore independent of scale, while errors such as CCD readout noise and dark current are completely independent of the intensity, and therefore must also be put on an absolute scale before they can be meaningfully combined with other errors.
Results
The R-factor gap affects even the highest-quality structures in the Protein Data Bank, so here we elected to simulate one of the most well-understood protein structures, Gallus gallus lysozyme in its tetragonal form, and collected data at the most widely available wavelength, the selenium edge (0.9795 A). As a selenomethionine analog of this protein was not available, we selected a derivative with the same f″ value of Se at its edge, gadolinium, which also avoids complications of simulating anomalous signal near an absorption edge.
The Gd ligand had to be modeled carefully so that the high electron density of the Gd ion did not dominate the Fobs À Fcalc differences. With the simulated data, the position, occupancy and B factor of the ligand atoms were known exactly, and were readily recovered during reﬁnement, so ligand error was negligible. If the ligand was not accurately derived from the real data, a noticeable drop in Rcryst and Rfree values was expected for the multi-conformer simulated data relative to the real data. This was not observed, indicating that the Gd ligand contributed little to the Rfactor gap in this case.
Data reduction statistics from real and simulated data are very similar
Real and simulated lysozyme diffraction images (Fig. 1) were prepared as described in the Experimental

procedures, and processed using both MOSFLM and XDS in order to compare and contrast the anomalous signal and other statistical indicators of data quality (Table 1). The mosaic spread reported by MOSFLM for the real dataset was 0.50, and, using a simulated mosaic spread of 0.4 in combination with 0.3% unit cell dispersion as suggested by Nave [25], resulted in a mosaic spread of 0.49 as reported by MOSFLM. XDS uses a different approach for estimating mosaic spread [20], resulting in values of 0.158 for the real data and 0.159 for the simulated data. The similar mosaic spread reported by the two programs is encouraging, and indi-

cates that our representation of mosaicity in the simulation is realistic.
The simulated crystal volume was also adjusted such that the real and simulated data had the same scale when combined with SCALA [26]. The scale of the real data changed with phi rotation, and the crystal was bigger than the beam, so a change in the illuminated volume over the course of data collection was expected. These scale factors may also be equally well explained by a variation in incident beam intensity, but this magnitude of drift over such a short experiment was considered highly unlikely with this instrument.

In order to match the low-angle Rmerge to that of the real data (3.9%), the detector calibration error was set to 5.4%, which is much larger than the manufacturer’s speciﬁed value of 0.2%. We conﬁrmed the 0.2% reproducibility of ﬂood ﬁelds, so this extra error must have had some other source. Beam ﬂicker, shutter jitter and sample self-absorption may all be excluded because these were calibrated independently, and including all of them in a MLFSOM simulation leads to a low-angle Rmerge of 0.5%. Diederichs reported similar unrealistically low values for Rmeas in the lowest-angle bin using data simulated with SIM_MX, and postulated that this was primarily due to an unknown and unmodeled systematic error [23].
Here we implemented this extra error in the form of detector calibration, but other possible candidates are sample vibration [17], non-isomorphism between parts of the crystal rotating in and out of the beam, and perhaps others. Understanding and reducing these errors is of considerable interest, but they are difﬁcult to distinguish using low-multiplicity datasets such as the one considered here. Thorough discussion of all these phenomena is beyond the scope of the present work, and neither vibration nor self-isomorphism are implemented in the current version of MLFSOM. For this study, we simply require that the combination of all systematic errors result in Rmerge = 3.9%, an effect that we simulated by adjusting detector calibration error alone.
The overall <I/r(I)> at 1.45 A resolution for the real data was 17.6 (XDS) and 16.6 (MOSFLM), and processing the simulated images resulted in values of 14.7 (XDS) and 15.0 (MOSFLM). The asymptotic ISa [27] from XDS reached 19.2 for the real data and 21.2 with

the simulated data. Without the extra systematic error introduced to match Rmerge, unrealistically high <I/r(I)> values were observed, both overall and in the lowangle bin, similar to the results seen with SIM_MX [23]. Overall the results from processing of our real and simulated data were encouraging, and showed that we had developed a simulation that is able to reproduce the expected errors in macromolecule diffraction data.
The sum of all errors is comparable to Rmerge
Having generated and processed a realistically noisy simulated dataset, we compared the ﬁnal, merged structure factors (Fsim) to the structure factors that were initially fed into the MLFSOM simulation (Fstart). Although Fsim appears in the data-processing output ﬁle as ‘Fobs’, we use Fsim to clarify that it is derived from a simulation and is not an experimental observation. Also, as this is a simulation, Fstart may be deﬁned to be the error-free ‘true’ structure factor. This deﬁnition allowed us to measure how much error the simulate-and-process-back procedure introduced into the ‘true’ structure factor, and therefore extrapolate the magnitude of the total experimental error in Fobs. This was done by inputting Fstart and Fsim into the CCP4 [26] program SCALEIT as though they were merged native and derivative datasets. After leastsquares reﬁning and applying a scale and B factor to Fsim, the R-factor (Rdiff) between Fstart and Fsim was 6.6% overall at 1.45 A and 2.8% in the low-resolution bin for XDS-processed data. For MOSFLM/SCALAprocessed data, these values were 6.9% overall, and

1.6% in the low-angle bin. These low residuals are quite remarkable considering how many sources of error were included in the MLFSOM simulation. The total error in the data (Rdiff) was comparable to the self-consistency of the data (Rmerge or Rmeas), implying that the accuracy of real data is similarly indicated by its precision. Speciﬁcally, the root mean square (RMS) value of r(Fsim) assigned by data-processing programs was found to be lower than the RMS difference between Fstart and Fsim by a factor 0.71 for XDS and 0.64 for MOSFLM/SCALA, i.e. the data are slightly less accurate than they are precise.
Overall, the total error in the data was only a few per cent, comparable to the magnitude of Rmerge, and thus cannot explain the typically observed macromolecular Rcryst/Rfree values of 20–30%. We therefore conclude that the high values of Rcryst/Rfree are not a direct manifestation of any of the sources of experimental error implemented in MLFSOM.
Models reﬁned against simulated data have unusually low reﬁnement R values
Given the similarity between Fstart and Fsim, it is perhaps not surprising that simply dropping the coordinate model that was used to calculate Fstart into reﬁnement against Fsim yields remarkably low values of Rcryst and Rfree. Speciﬁcally, we obtained starting Rcryst/Rfree values of 7.37%/7.16%, which evolve to 6.75%/8.06% after 100 cycles in REFMAC [28]. Rmerge is an intensity statistic, and therefore represents twice the relative error in F, complicating direct comparison to Rcryst and Rfree. Weak data also inﬂate reﬁnement R-factors signiﬁcantly above the relative error in r(F). For these reasons, small-molecule structures are evaluated using R1, for which data with I < 4xr(I) are omitted, and

Rsigma = <r(I)>/<I>. The validation criterion is R1 < 2*Rsigma, and no structure in the Protein Data Bank passes this test. In our case, both Fsim and Fobs have Rsigma = 4%, and after reﬁning the ‘right answer’ coordinate model against Fsim, we obtained R1 = 4.3%, easily passed this small-molecule quality standard.
However, as R1 and Rsigma are rarely used in macromolecular crystallography, we compare Rmerge to Rcryst and Rfree using data cut to 2 A resolution (last column of Table 2 and Fig. 3). Reﬁning the ‘right answer’ coordinate model against Fsim data truncated to 2.0 A yields Rcryst/Rfree = 3.92%/5.59%, comparable to R1.
However, reﬁning this same model and data in phe-
nix.reﬁne [29], gives signiﬁcantly higher values, i.e. Rcryst/Rfree = 7.38%/9.88% to 2 A resolution, which do not pass the R1 versus Rsigma test. The main reason for this discrepancy is because implementation of the
bulk solvent correction differs between these two
reﬁnement programs and the bulk solvent mask from
REFMAC was used to compute Fstart. REFMAC uses two different solvent probe radii to model ionic and
Van der Waals interactions with bulk solvent, whereas
phenix.reﬁne uses the same probe radius for all coordi-
nate atoms. Even when phenix.reﬁne was set to optimize_mask = True, the Rcryst/Rfree values were 7.19%/ 9.94% and the Fsim À Fcalc difference map only contained features far from atomic positions. Neither of
these programs can reproduce the bulk solvent mask
of the other in their current implementations. Indeed,
after reﬁning the same model against Fobs using each program, Rdiff calculated as described above with SCALEIT between the calculated total structure fac-
tors ‘FC_ALL_LS’ from REFMAC and ‘F-model’
from phenix.reﬁne yielded an Rdiff value of 11.2%. This relatively large difference coming from the bulk
solvent, which is ‘invisible’ in normally contoured elec-

tron density maps, highlights how sensitive R-factors are to features that fall below traditional map contour levels [16]. However, as it would take three independent sources of 11.2% error to add in quadrature to 20%, and seven sources to reach 30%, this 11.2% is still signiﬁcantly smaller than the R-factor gap, some other source of systematic error must be involved.
Building atomic models with low R-factors does not require phase information
The uncharacteristically low Rcryst/Rfree achieved when reﬁning against simulated data with realistic noise suggests that Rcryst/Rfree values obtained with real data may in theory be just as low, provided the ‘true’ state of the electron density in the unit cell is accurately represented by the model. It is unclear what inadequacies in the model are responsible for this. Do mistakes in model building accumulate by becoming ‘locked in’ by phase bias? Or is it simply not possible to represent the ‘true’ electron density of real unit cells using existing coordinate-and-bulk-solvent models?

To address this question, we generated a new set of Fstart values from a single-conformer model of lysozyme, and repeated the full MLFSOM simulation and XDS processing followed by phenix.autobuild with anomalous data (Fig. 2), and then implemented a simplistic Fsim À Fcalc guided build-back procedure (see Experimental procedures). The results are shown in Fig. 3, together with those for exactly the same rebuilding algorithm performed on real data. Despite the virtually identical data-processing statistics, the simulated data rapidly converge to small molecule-like Rcryst/Rfree values of 3.8%/5.5%, but the real data do not. In fact, the ﬁnal Rcryst/Rfree using Fsim is essentially identical to the values of 3.92%/5.59% obtained by dropping the ‘right answer’ coordinate model directly into the reﬁnement. This result implies that, provided the ‘right answer’ is a single-conformer structure with unit occupancy, good geometry and ﬂat bulk solvent, then simply building into Fobs À Fcalc difference features may be expected to rapidly and easily converge to the ‘right answer’. The noise in the data and the lack of any external phase information are

In both cases, the processed data were provided to phenix.autobuild with anomalous differences, the sequence of lysozyme and no other sources of phase information. The resulting model was trimmed of all water atoms and subjected to a simple ﬁve-step rebuilding procedure using data truncated to 2.0 A: (1) reﬁne in REFMAC for 500 cycles, or until atoms and B factors stop moving, (2) add dummy atoms to the ﬁve highest peaks in the difference map, (3) assign new atoms the proper atom name if they are within 0.5 A of an atom in the reference model, (4) remove atoms with B > 100 A2 or that fall on negative difference features < À6r, and (5) repeat until convergence. Models built into the simulated data converge to very low Rfree values (Rcryst = 4.57% and Rfree = 7.27%), roughly the same magnitude as the Rmerge from the XDS/MOSFLM-processed data, whereas the Rfree for the real data never goes below 20%.

simply not enough to trap the building and reﬁnement into a local minimum. We therefore conclude that the reason why building and reﬁnement with Fobs does not converge to small molecule-like Rcryst/Rfree values is because the content of the real unit cell cannot be accurately represented by current coordinate models. Otherwise, building into Fobs À Fcalc difference features would converge.

Relative contributions of sources of error
Whenever possible, published values are used for these parameters. For example, detector performance was taken from manufacturer’s speciﬁcations. Where no published values are available (such as the jitter in the shutter), parameters were measured experimentally at Advanced Light Source beamlines 8.3.1 [30] and 12.3.1

[31] (Table 3), but it is a simple matter to input the characteristics of a different beamline if they are known. A general result of testing MLFSOM is that only one of the many sources of noise in the diffraction experiment typically dominates a given dataset. For example, the noise introduced by background scattering limits the signal-to-noise ratio of faint, highresolution spots, and detector readout noise is only important in cases where the background is very low.
Conversely, X-ray background and readout noise have almost no effect on anomalous data. This may be demonstrated by turning off background and readout noise in the simulator or by adding additional readout noise to real images and examining the resulting anomalous signal. Anomalous differences are so small that they may only be measured with thousands of photons per spot, where the relative error due to photon counting is less than a few per cent. Because of this, small relative errors, like the ones that propagate through Darwin’s formula, dominate the errors in anomalous difference measurements. However, MLFSOM simulations using realistic levels of shutter jitter, beam ﬂicker and sample self-absorption produced lowangle Rmerge values of less than 0.5% and <I/r(I)> values > 100, which is clearly unrealistic. It was only after including detector calibration error that realistic statistics were obtained, indicating that a truly ‘perfect’ detector would enable S-SAD phasing with Bijvoet ratios less than 0.5%. Unfortunately, no current detectors give Rmerge or Rmeas values less than 1%.
Discussion
Realistic simulation of diffraction images using MLFSOM, and subsequent processing with commonly used data-reduction programs reproduced essentially all relevant data quality metrics, but still did not change the structure factors by more than a few per cent, indicating that modern data-reduction packages accurately capture structure factor amplitudes. Furthermore, applying a standard SAD phasing pipeline followed by careful rebuilding without phase restraints consistently recovered the ‘right answer’ model with remarkably low Rcryst/Rfree values (Fig. 3). This tells us that not only are reﬁnement programs stable to realistic noise, but conventional difference map-guided model building should converge to ‘small molecule’ precision. Why is this not possible with real data? There are two places that the residual systematic error may reside: in either the protein or the solvent.
There have been many attempts over the decades to apply multi-conformer models [32–36], but the reductions in Rfree have never been more than approxi-

mately 4%. This is consistent with the quadrature summation of errors if half the errors arise from the multi-conformer protein and half from solvent. For example, if 20% error is coming from hidden conformers in the protein region, and another 20% from the unﬂatness of the solvent region, then the total error will be 28%. If we assume no correlation between the solvent errors and the model errors, then eliminating all errors in either region entirely will still lead to Rfree ‘hanging up’ at approximately 20%, not 14% as one would expect if two errors added algebraically to 28%.
Unfortunately, reﬁnement tends to spread errors evenly across the map, which means that the nonﬂatness of the solvent must be explained if we are to ever achieve noise levels in electron density maps on a par with experimental noise. For example, if there was no noise at all and the model reﬁned down to an R-factor near zero, then removing any single atom would produce an enormous Fobs À Fcalc peak. During our automated build-back procedure, the peak height of the next difference feature of the simulated data steadily increased with building cycle, a behavior that is not observed with real macromolecular data (Fig. 4). With the simulated data, this is because the phases are steadily improving, the occupancy of all the atoms are unity, the bulk solvent is ﬂat, and each atom has a perfectly Gaussian-shaped Debye– Waller factor. In the case of real data, the model has

these same characteristics, and apparently the errors that arise from this assumption accumulate faster than the new difference features rise. However, if the coordinate model were more realistic and the building strategy more intelligent, there would be every reason to expect that the difference features will become increasingly more obvious all the way down to ‘small molecule’-like R-factors. Speciﬁcally, if the error in the map arises from experimental noise only, it would generally be less than 5%, and as carbon contains six electrons, single-electron changes are approximately 18%. This is independent of diffracted resolution, implying that data with sufﬁcient overall signal-to-noise are capable of distinguishing singleelectron changes. However, as long as the model– data difference remains above 20%, these subtle features remain indiscernible.
Although the bulk solvent itself may at ﬁrst seem uninteresting, the ‘littoral zone’ between the protein and solvent channels is after all the interface between the molecule of interest and the rest of the world. Substrates, ligands and even other proteins must pass through this region for biochemical reactions to occur, so its structure and the forces involved in it are key to understanding function. A better understanding of solvent density will also have cross-over beneﬁts in other scattering techniques, in much the same way that previous work on crystallographic water [37–39] led to better water models for small-angle X-ray scattering analyses [40]. Developments in other ﬁelds, such as the ability to distinguish between conformational switching and bona ﬁde disorder in small-angle X-ray scattering analysis [41], may also help build better crystallographic models. The microscopic behavior of water is still an active ﬁeld of research [42–44], and our understanding of it continues to improve. Recently, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a protein crystal revealed details in the solvent density beyond what was originally built into electron density maps [45], suggesting that a synergy between MX and MD more fully describing multiple protein conformations and the protein-solvent interface may ﬁnally be underway.
An exciting possibility is that realization of such untapped information in the almost 78 000 macromolecular datasets in the Protein Data Bank [46] will spark a wave of new methodological developments and functional insights [47]. It is clear now that model building and reﬁnement are held back neither by noise nor phases but instead by the appropriateness of the modeling framework currently used to represent macromolecules and their environment – both protein and solvent. Better models will inevitably provide better descriptions of the dynamic nature of macromolecules

that is so critical for their function. Once such models are built, we expect the wealth of structural data accumulated during the high-throughput structural genomics era to stimulate insights into comprehensive protein dynamics and the key protein–water interface. The resulting enhanced knowledge of ﬂexibility and the solvent interface will propel us towards more accurate crystal structures that will support improvements in computational methods and better link structure to activity and biology.
Experimental procedures
Reference lysozyme dataset
A reference dataset was collected at Advanced Light Source beamline 8.3.1 from a lysozyme crystal measuring 0.12 9 0.21 9 0.3 mm grown with Gd-HPD03A [a neutral gadolinium complex with 10- (2-hydroxypropyl)-1,4,7,10tetra-azacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) as previously described [48,49]. The detector was a model Quantum 315r (Area Detector Systems Corporation, Poway, CA) operating in hardware binning mode with the data collection parameters shown in Table 4 . The Gd/lysozyme crystals were chosen because they combine the well-understood nature of lysozyme and the Se-like f″ value of Gd at the Se edge.

Simulated lysozyme datasets
Two simulated datasets were generated by MLFSOM using the same parameters as the real data, some of which were reﬁned values from processing of the reference dataset. Other parameters, such as ﬂux, detector calibration error, and the magnitude of all sources of error were each calibrated from independent experiments (Tables 2 and 3). The ﬁrst simulated dataset (multi-conformer simulated) was generated from a coordinate model containing alternate conformation side chains and Gd ligand positions reﬁned against the real data collected here. This model was generated starting with Protein Data Bank ID 1h87, reﬁning alternately using phenix.reﬁne [29] and REFMAC [28], with periodic rounds of manual rebuilding using Coot [50,51]. After a ﬁnal reﬁnement using REFMAC, the calculated bulk solvent contribution was

extracted using the MSKOUT feature, and these structure factors were added to those of the coordinate atoms before calculating anomalous differences using ano_sfall.com. The resulting values of F+ and F- were then input in to the mlfsom.com script to generate the simulated diffraction images. The second simulated dataset (single-conformer simulated) was generated from a simpliﬁed version of this model containing only single conformer side chains and two Gd sites, reﬁned against the real data with the X-ray weight reduced so that the right answer had excellent geometry.
Random errors
The simulated sources of random error included beam ﬂicker, shutter jitter, detector readout noise, dark current,

and X-ray shot noise from both Bragg-scattered photons and background. The beam ﬂicker was taken to be the RMS variation of the direct beam intensity on a photodiode placed at the sample position at Advanced Light Source beamline 8.3.1, which was 0.15% at 5 Hz or 0.067%/√Hz if it follows a canonical 1/frequency power spectrum, but, to be safe, the value 0.15%/√Hz was used in the simulation. The shutter jitter was apparent in the variation of the PHIZ camera parameter reﬁned by MOSFLM (Doc. S1), and dominated by the 2 ms update rate of the PMAC motor controller (DeltaTau Inc., Los Angeles, CA). This generates a sawtooth distribution of timing errors with an RMS of 0.577 ms. The readout noise of the detector was taken from blank images as RMS 4.1 pixel level (ADU) variation, with additional noise from the dark current accumulating at 0.036 RMS ADU/s. The shot noise (photon-counting error) was taken as the square root of the expectation value of photons that were absorbed in the phosphor layer of the detector.
Systematic errors
Attenuation of X-rays in the sample, the air and the detector are all sources of systematic error. These were calculated using Beer’s law [52–54] and the tabulated cross-sections from the National Institute of Standards and Technology XCOM database [55]. The shape of the sample was represented using a facet/planes model, by which the surface of the sample was approximated as a collection of planes deﬁning each facet. As the simulated crystal rotated, the intersection point between the incident X-ray beam and the facet currently in its path was computed. The distance from this point to the center of the sample was taken as the ﬁrst segment of the X-ray attenuation path, with the second segment similarly calculated for the diffracted beam exiting toward each pixel.
The energy deposited into the phosphor was also computed from Beer’s law using its mass energy absorption cross-section [56]. It is this dose that leads to the visible light that is eventually detected by the CCD. The vignette effect, which makes transmission 40% less efﬁcient at the corners of each ﬁberoptic taper than at the center, was simulated by scaling down the absorbed photons before calculating the shot noise error, and then scaling back up to simulate the ﬂood-ﬁeld correction.
The point spread function was implemented as described previously [57], with the width varying twofold from the center to corner of each module to simulate the corner correction effect. Another effect of the point spread function varying across the face of the detector is that it limits the applicability of the ﬂood ﬁeld correction to sharp features such as spots. Together with other sources of systematic error, this calibration error effect must have resulted in the observed Rmerge = 3.9% in the lowest-angle bin. Although detector calibration was probably not the

only source of systematic error at work, for this low-multiplicity dataset, the total error was implemented as a ﬁxed mask of scale factors varying by RMS 5.4% from unity with a spatial frequency of ﬁve pixels. This mask was multiplied by the spot intensities on every image, and the resulting Rmerge and ISa were equal to those of the real data.
The simulated spindle was misaligned 0.1° from ideal to induce realistic errors in the Lorentz factor. The illuminated crystal volume was made to vary in thickness from 120 to 200 lm as the crystal rotated, matching the scale factors of the real dataset. Global radiation damage was modeled as an exponential decay with resolution and dose, reaching half the undamaged spot intensity at 10 MGy/A as described previously [15]. Speciﬁc damage may be modeled by a similar dose-dependent conversion of the zerodose set of pristine structure factors to those of a heavily damaged structure using radiation-induced non-isomorphism of 1% for every MGy of dose [58]. However, as the total dose to the sample in the real dataset was less than 40 kGy, the effect of radiation damage was negligible for the simulations reported here.
Background scattering from air, water and Paratone-N oil (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) was calibrated from constant-resolution pixel average of the diffraction pattern from reference materials of known thickness. Diffuse scatter from disorder in the crystal lattice and Compton scattering from the whole sample were modeled as described in Doc. S1. The sum of all these sources of background reproduced the background level in the reference experiment very well (Fig. 1). It should be noted that, by deﬁnition, diffuse scatter is ‘ﬂat’ underneath the Bragg peaks, as the act of integrating a background-subtracted spot in reciprocal space is mathematically equivalent to averaging the electron density over a patch of unit cells equal to the reciprocal dimension of the spot size. This is usually a few hundred nanometers, so deviations from the cell repeat must be correlated for many dozens of unit cells in a row for it to contribute more to the integration area than it does outside of it.
Spot shapes were represented as the sum of a collection of Gaussian peaks. Each spot-broadening parameter (beam divergence, spectral dispersion and mosaic spread) was evaluated individually. If sweeping any one of these over its entire range moved a spot by more than two pixels, then the parameter was split into sub-beams or sub-crystals. A separate parameter splitting was performed for every spot. For example, if the beam divergence was wide enough to spread a spot over six pixels, then the beam was divided into three sub-beams, each with one-third of the divergence of the overall beam, but with slightly different directions.
The width of the rocking curve due to each effect was evaluated using the Greenhough–Helliwell equation [59], and the effect was split again if it broadened the spot by more than 1°. Each diffraction spot produced by each sub-

beam from each sub-crystal was then treated separately when computing spot width, height and tilt on the detector face by partial numerical differentiation of spot position with respect to divergence, dispersion and mosaic rotation about the beam. These widths were then convoluted together to form a single 2D anisotropic Gaussian peak on the detector surface. This shape was then convoluted with the Gaussian series expansion of the point spread function [57]. The partiality of each sub-spot was computed by applying the rocking width given by the Greenhough–Helliwell equation to the rocking curve of a disk-shaped reciprocal lattice point passing through the Ewald sphere described by Winkler et al. [60]. MLFSOM also supports Gaussian, Lorentzian, arctan, ‘top hat’ or square rocking curve functions, but the disk function was empirically found to best match the spot shapes of the real data.
Current limitations of MLFSOM
Every effort was made to include all effects postulated to have a signiﬁcant impact on data quality into the MLFSOM simulation, but the ‘realism’ is by no means perfect. For example, the crystal size was described by a single length parameter, as was the X-ray beam, and both are considered to be square. There is no allowance for non-uniform radiation damage as the crystal rotates [61]. Beam shape and mosaic spread are both presumed to have simple ‘top hat’ shapes with no internal structure. Photon counts have a Poisson distribution, but all other sources of error such as beam ﬂicker, shutter jitter and readout noise were taken from a normal distribution. The spatial, ﬂood and dark corrections normally used with CCD detectors [62] are not currently implemented explicitly, nor is electron-counting noise as this becomes signiﬁcant only for very long exposures.
Processing real and simulated lysozyme data
For both real and simulated lysozyme data, the images were reduced to mtz format reﬂection ﬁles using either MOSFLM [18], SCALA and TRUNCATE [26] or XDS, XSCALE and XDSCONV [20] as pipelines. In both cases, a 5% Rfree set was assigned, and the same Rfree ﬂags were used for the real and simulated data. For side-by-side comparisons, both the real and simulated data were input to phenix.autosol as SAD datasets. Statistics are shown in Table 1.
Build-back routine
For the rebuilding test shown in Fig. 3, a model of lysozyme was generated to include only a single conformer for every atom, with all occupancies set to 1.0. This model was reﬁned to convergence against the real data using REFMAC with the X-ray weight turned down, so that the resulting model had excellent geometry. A new value of

Fstart was calculated from this coordinate model and the best-ﬁt bulk solvent mask from the last cycle of REFMAC. This Fstart value was used to simulate a new set of images with the same camera and noise parameters described above, and processed back to Fsim using XDS.
The F+ and FÀ data from processing the real, multi-conformer simulated and single-conformer simulated images were input to phenix.autosol and phenix.autobuild, together with the sequence of lysozyme and instructions to ﬁnd two Gd sites. The ﬁnal Rcryst/Rfree values of these runs are shown in Table 2. The water molecules, side chains and ligands from these models were then removed, and the remaining protein main chain was reﬁned to convergence against Fobs or Fsim (no anomalous) using up to 500 cycles in REFMAC. Then dummy atoms (DUM in REFMAC) were added to the highest ﬁve peaks in the Fobs À Fcalc or Fsim À Fcalc difference map. To simulate ideal chemical intuition on each building cycle, each peak found to be within 0.5 A of an atom in the ‘right answer’ model was assigned the proper atom name, but the xyz coordinates remained those of the initial picked peak. Each newly added atom was assigned the median B factor of the current model. After each build cycle, another 500 cycles of reﬁnement were performed, and again dummy atoms were added at the top ﬁve positive difference peak positions. For each build cycle, if the largest difference peak was negative, any atom found within 0.5 A of that negative peak was eliminated. Atoms with B factors that increased to more than ten times the median absolute deviation from the median B factor were also discarded. The Rcryst/Rfree history of this building and reﬁnement procedure is shown in Fig. 3. Exactly the same procedure was applied to the real data, and the results are also shown in Fig. 3.
The images for all datasets are available from http:// bl831.als.lbl.gov/example_data_sets/mlfsom/. Coordinates and structure factors for the real data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 4tws.
