14 Introduction
15 Proton transfer dynamics in complex aqueous environments continue to garner immense 16 interest from both experimentalists and theorists.1,2 In particular, the air-water interface 17 presents an unusual discontinuity and asymmetry in intermolecular interactions, resulting 18 in diﬀerent dynamical properties than those observed in a bulk aqueous environment. For 19 example, molecules that reside at the interface encounter vastly diﬀerent interactions and 20 undergo unique conformations compared those found in the bulk.3 This same abrupt change 21 at the interface can enhance reactivity in various chemical processes, such as the oxidation 22 of halide ions by OH radicals or O3 in the ozone cycle.4 As such, the dissociation of acid 23 molecules at the air-water interface provides a microscopic understanding of reactivity at 24 the interface, which can play additional catalytic roles during these dynamical events.5–7 25 Organic acids such as carboxylic (RCOOH) and dicarboxylic acids have attracted growing 26 interest due to their important role in troposphere chemistry.8,9 In particular, acetic acid 27 is a normal metabolite of vegetation10 and contributes to less volatile organic compounds 28 (VOCs).11 Acetic acid is also found in clouds12–14 and fog,15 which contributes to a signiﬁcant 29 fraction of observed gas-phase acidity in the atmosphere.8,16 Furthermore, the concentration 30 of these carboxylic acids may increase pollution in urban environments and is a substantial 31 contributor to photochemical smog.16 Although acetic acid is weaker than other mineral acids 32 such as nitric and sulfuric acid, carboxylic acids are found in much larger concentrations and 33 may have a more substantial overall eﬀect on the free acidity of rainwater. In particular, 34 Knee and Galloway predicted that acetic and formic acid might account for 16 to 35 percent 35 of the free acidity of precipitation in the United States alone.17 36 Recent experimental studies on acetic acid have shown an enhanced acidity on the sur37 face of water, with only a slight dissociation to the carboxylate anion at low concentrations 38 in water.18 At bulk concentrations (≈ 0.5-mole fraction of acetic acid), approximately 99% 39 of the acetic acid remains undissociated.19,20 The deprotonation reactions of formic and 40 acetic acid in aqueous environments have also been probed with X-ray photoelectron21–23

41 and VSFG spectroscopic techniques.24,25 Both techniques reported no or minimal deproto42 nation at the air-water interface. Previous theoretical calculations, such as micro-hydration 43 techniques, examined binding energies and minimum energy structures of acetic acid-water 44 clusters.26,27 Transition path sampling and metadynamics simulations have also been used to 45 predict dissociation mechanisms of acetic acid in bulk ambient water.28,29 Finally, additional 46 theoretical studies have also conﬁrmed that carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, have a par47 ticular aﬃnity towards the air-water interface due the presence of both hydrophilic hydroxyl 48 and hydrophobic methyl groups.30,31 49 Motivated by these innovative experimental advancements and recent studies, we decided 50 to further investigate the deprotonation of acetic acid at the air-water interface to provide 51 theoretical insight into these complex dynamical processes. To this end, we have carried 52 out ab initio-based metadynamics simulations to study the deprotonation mechanisms of 53 acetic acid by calculating the free-energy landscape at the air-water interface as well as 54 in a bulk aqueous environment. As such, this work provides mechanistic insight and oﬀers 55 quantum-based predictions of acetic acid in conﬁned aqueous environments for understanding 56 these complex dynamical eﬀects. These computational techniques allow us to (1) probe the 57 detailed mechanisms and time scales of acetic acid deprotonation dynamics and (2) re58 construct the free energy surface in bulk aqueous and air-water interfacial conﬁgurations 59 to obtain free energy dissociation barriers in these environments. Based on our ﬁndings, 60 we propose underlying mechanistic reasons for the lower free energy barrier of acetic acid 61 deprotonation at the air-water interface compared to the bulk.
62 Simulations details
63 AIMD simulations
64 All ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were carried out using the QUICK65 STEP32–34 module in the CP2K software suite.35,36 The QUICKSTEP module in CP2K uti-

66 lizes hybrid Gaussian and plane-wave (GPW)37 schemes for the eﬃcient calculation of forces 67 and energies. GTH pseudopotentials38,39 are used to describe the atomic core electrons, and 68 the Kohn-Sham orbitals for the valence electrons employed the TZV2P basis set.40 All of our 69 simulations utilized the BLYP41–43 functional with D3 dispersion corrections.44 The orbital 70 transformation method with an electronic gradient tolerance value of 1 × 10−5 Hartree was 71 used as the convergence criteria for the SCF cycle.32 At each molecular dynamics step, the 72 initial guess was given by the stable predictor-corrector extrapolation method.45,46 A time 73 step of 0.5 fs was used for integrating the equations of motion, and the energy cut-oﬀ for the 74 auxiliary plane-wave basis set was ﬁxed to 300 Ry. All simulations were carried out at 300 75 K using a Nose-Hoover chain thermostat.47,48
76 Bulk simulations
77 For the bulk aqueous conﬁguration, we placed a single acetic acid molecule with 64 explicit 78 waters in a cubic box with side lengths of 12.42 ˚A (which closely approximates the experimen79 tal density of 64 water molecules). The initial geometry was generated using the PACKMOL 80 software package,49 and a 15-ps NPT simulation was subsequently carried out at 300 K to 81 obtain the equilibrium volume for a single acetic acid molecule in water. The pressure was 82 controlled by the barostat suggested by Mundy and co-workers.50 The NPT simulation was 83 subsequently used to determine the density of this acetic acid-water mixture. The resulting 84 density of the mixture reached 1.001 g/cm3, which corresponds to an average box length of 85 12.12 ˚A. After ﬁxing the average box length, we continued with an additional 5-ps of an 86 NVT simulation with a massive Nose-Hoover chain thermostat. For our production runs, 87 we subsequently performed another 50 ps of an NVT simulation with a global Nose-Hoover 88 thermostat. Periodic boundary conditions were implemented in the x, y, and z directions 89 for the bulk aqueous simulations.

90 Interfacial simulations
91 For our interfacial acetic acid-water model, we generated a thin water slab comprised of 73 92 water molecules within a rectangular supercell with dimensions of 15.56 ˚A × 15.56 ˚A × 40 93 ˚A, as shown in Figure 1b. For understanding surface eﬀects, slab models with very similar 94 compositions have been previously shown to produce a consistent air-water interface.31,51,52 95 For the air-water interface conﬁguration, periodic boundary conditions were applied in the 96 x and y directions of the slab. Thus, the xy-plane of the slab system remains parallel to 97 the surface, and the z-axis forms the surface normal where acetic acid collides with the 98 surface water molecules. Before placing an acetic acid molecule in the slab, the bare water 99 slab was equilibrated with an NVT ensemble for 15 ps by applying a massive Nose-Hoover 100 chain thermostat at 300 K. After equilibration, a single acetic acid molecule was placed 6 101 ˚A above the center of mass of the slab along the z-direction. The center of mass of the 102 acetic acid molecule was constrained, and an additional 2 ps NVT equilibration was carried 103 out with the massive Nose-Hoover chain thermostat. Next, the constraint was released, and
5

104 an additional 50-ps NVT simulation was carried out. We also carried out calculations at 105 a slightly higher temperature of 330 K to probe structural and dynamical eﬀects of acetic 106 acid at the air-water interface. As suggested by previous studies,31,53,54 we used a harmonic 107 constraint with a constant spring value of 1 Hartree throughout the simulations to maintain 108 the slab at the origin of the coordinate system.

109 Metadynamics simulations

110 An enhanced sampling method was required to explore the deprotonation mechanisms of 111 aqueous acetic acid and obtain the free energy barrier of dissociation. In metadynamics 112 simulations, the free energy surface is produced from a biasing potential, which depends on 113 the set of predeﬁned collective variables. The initial structure for our metadynamics simula114 tions was extracted from pre-equilibrated BOMD simulations. To determine the free energy 115 surface of activation for the dissociation of acetic acid in the bulk vs. the air-water interface 116 between its neutral form and anionic form, a minimum free energy path was calculated by 117 adequately deﬁning the collective variable. The collective variable describes the coordina118 tion number during the metadynamics simulations, and the following expression was used 119 to calculate the value of the coordination number (CN):

p

CV1 or CN =

1−

dAB
d0 p+q ,

(1)

1−

dAB d0

120 where dAB is the distance between atoms A and B, and d0 is the reference distance or ﬁxed 121 cut-oﬀ parameter. This parameter distinguishes the standard bond distance between atoms 122 A and B. In the present case, we chose the distance between the O and H atoms of the 123 hydroxyl group of CH3COOH as a collective variable. In equation 1, p and q are constants, 124 which were set to p = q = 6. These values are utilized to diﬀerentiate between the coor125 dinated and non-coordinated states. For the O-H pair of atoms, the CN value is almost 126 unity (0.8 in practice) when dAB < d0, and the value of CN approaches zero rapidly (0.26

6

127 in practice) when dAB > d0. In the preesent case, the d0 value for O-H was set to 1.60 ˚A. 128 The deposition rate for the Gaussian hills was set to 100 steps during the metadynamics 129 simulations, and the Gaussian width and height were set to 0.1 and 0.0005 Hartree, respec130 tively. We carried out two metadynamics calculations using diﬀerent initial conditions for 131 the bulk aqueous and interfacial environments. The metadynamics simulations were run for 132 22 ps (trajectory 01) and 36 ps (trajectory 02) for the bulk aqueous and 8 ps (trajectory 01) 133 and 10 ps (trajectory 02) for air-water conﬁgurations, respectively. We conﬁrmed a good 134 sampling and convergence of the reactant, product, transition state, and free energy diﬀer135 ences, particularly for the deprotonation barrier. It is worth mentioning that more complex 136 metadynamics approaches (with as many as three collective variables) have been used to 137 explore high-dimensional conﬁgurations.28 However, these approaches may take a consider138 able amount of computational time, even when well-tempered metadynamics simulations are 139 used. As such, the single-CV approach used in our calculations allows convergence of the 140 free energy proﬁle in a reasonable amount of time and computational eﬀort.

141 Results and discussion

142 Density proﬁle of interfacial water
143 The density of bulk water can be estimated by ﬁtting the density proﬁle in the water slab 144 conﬁgurations. We calculated the density proﬁle of water along the surface normal (z axis) 145 and ﬁtted it with a hyperbolic tangent function:

1

ρ(z) = 2 (ρ1 + ρv) − 2 (ρ1 − ρv) tanh

z − zGDS δ

,

(2)

146 where ρ1 represents the density of bulk water, and ρv is the density of the water vapor phase. 147 The ρv value was set to zero during the density proﬁle ﬁtting. In the above equation, zGDS 148 is the z-coordinate of the Gibbs dividing surface (the point where the density is half of the 149 bulk water density), and δ is the thickness parameter of the interface. The density proﬁles 150 of water from the acetic acid-water slab systems at 300 and 330 K are shown in Figure 2. 151 Fitting the 300 K density proﬁle to equation 2 gives a water density (ρ1), Gibbs dividing 152 surface (zGDS), and interfacial thickness (δ) of 0.99 gm/cm3, 3.90 ˚A, and 1.55 ˚A, respectively. 153 For 330 K, the density ﬁtting procedure gives ρ1, zGDS, and δ values of 0.93 g/cm3, 4.25 ˚A, 154 and 1.35 ˚A, respectively. The computed density proﬁle at 300 K is very similar to the 155 density proﬁle obtained by Mundy and co-workers, which used a gradient-corrected BLYP 156 functional.55 Our calculations of the water density (= 0.99 gm/cm3) at 300 K match closely 157 with previous studies that reported densities of 1.06 gm/cm3 and 1.07 gm/cm3 at 295 K.56,57

158 Surface aﬃnity of acetic acid and hydroxyl bond length
159 Figure 3 shows the dynamics of acetic acid within a water slab at 300 and 330 K. The 160 gray stripe indicates the top surface of the water slab where acetic acid will collide/reside. 161 We deﬁne the thickness of the interface to be zGDS − δ < z < zGDS + δ within the water 162 slab for all temperatures. We did not observe any acetic acid scattering from the slab

163 interface or diﬀusion into the bulk. Due to restrictions associated with the computationally 164 intensive ab initio simulations, a 50 ps trajectory length is likely too short to observe acetic 165 acid diﬀusion into the bulk. As such, the acetic acid molecule remains essentially near 166 the air-water interface during the simulations. Figure S1 in the Supplementary Material 167 plots the acetic acid hydroxyl bond length as a function of time at 300 and 330 K for the 168 interfacial simulations. The horizontal blue dotted line at 1.00 ˚A indicates the equilibrium 169 O-H bond distance. During the AIMD simulations, the O-H bond is stretched from its 170 equilibrium position due to hydrogen-bond interactions with neighboring water molecules, 171 but no trajectories resulted in acetic acid deprotonation at the surface.

172 Solvation shell structure
173 We examined the structural correlations of acetic acid in the bulk aqueous environment 174 and air-water interface by calculating radial distribution functions (RDFs). The calculated 175 RDFs of O-Hw and H-Ow pairs for bulk vs. slab conﬁgurations are shown in Figure 4. The O 176 and H atoms represent the carbonyl oxygen and the hydroxyl hydrogen atom of acetic acid, 177 respectively. The O-Hw and H-Ow RDFs for a bulk aqueous environment are shown in Figure 178 4(a). The number integral represents the coordination number. The ﬁrst peak of the O-Hw 179 proﬁle at the bulk aqueous environment occurs at 1.90 ˚A, followed by a minimum at 2.50 ˚A. 180 The integration of the peak up to the ﬁrst minimum position leads to a hydration number 181 of 2.01. This peak is correlated with the hydrogen bond formation between the carbonyl 182 oxygen of acetic acid and the H atom of the surrounding water molecules. Therefore, the
10

183 carbonyl oxygen atom of acetic acid participates in approximately two hydrogen bonds in a 184 bulk aqueous environment. The H-Ow RDF pair has a sharp ﬁrst peak at 1.65 ˚A, followed by 185 a minimum at 2.32 ˚A in the bulk aqueous environment. The height of the peak in the H-Ow 186 RDF is somewhat larger compared to the O-Hw RDF pair in the bulk. The sharp peak for 187 the H-Ow pair also indicates a strong hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl hydrogen of the 188 acetic acid molecule and the oxygen atom of the surrounding water molecules. The value of 189 the number integral up to the ﬁrst minimum of the H-Ow RDF is 1.0, which corresponds to 190 the hydrogen bond number. Our reported values of acetic acid-water RDFs in bulk water 191 agree with earlier simulation studies.58 192 The O-Hw and H-Ow RDFs at the air-water interface are displayed in Figures 4(b) and 193 4(c), respectively, for all the temperatures. The RDF units at the interface are arbitrary 194 since the box lengths in the x, y, and z directions are diﬀerent. Therefore, a relative unit 195 of measurement is used to calculate the relative atom distribution vs. the distance between 196 various RDF pairs at the air-water interface. The ﬁrst peak of the O-Hw RDF proﬁles occurs 197 at 1.86 ˚A for all of the temperatures. The position of the peak does not change appreciably 198 with temperature; however, an increase in temperature does decrease the peak height. At 199 300 K, the ﬁrst minimum of the O-Hw RDF is located at 2.35 ˚A; in contrast, the position of 200 this minimum becomes localized at 2.63 ˚A when the temperature is increased to 330 K. The 201 integration of the peaks up to the ﬁrst minimum contributes a 1.63 (300 K) and 1.90 (330 202 K) hydrogen bond coordination for the carbonyl oxygen atom of acetic acid at the air-water 203 interface. The hydrogen bond coordination number for O-Hw pairs at the interface is slightly 204 lower than the bulk aqueous environment. 205 Sharp peaks occur at 1.65 ˚A and are accompanied by successive minima at 2.50 ˚A for 206 H-Ow RDF pairs at the surface. For the H-Ow RDF pairs, the peak and minima positions 207 are unchanged when the temperature is varied. The integration of these peaks up to the ﬁrst 208 minima positions leads to a hydration number of 1.0. The sharp peak and deeper minima of 209 the H-Ow RDF pair in the bulk aqueous and air-water conﬁgurations suggest that acetic acid
11

210 makes signiﬁcant hydrogen bonding interactions with the hydroxyl group compared to the 211 C=O group. The hydroxyl oxygen of the acetic acid can also act as a proton acceptor to form 212 a hydrogen bond with neighboring water molecules. To investigate these dynamical eﬀects, 213 we also calculated Ohydroxyl-Hw RDFs in Figure S2 within the Supplementary Material. The 214 RDFs show tiny peaks between 1.80 to 2.00 ˚A for the bulk aqueous environment and peaks 215 at 2.00 to 2.50 ˚A for the air-water interface, indicating direct interaction of water molecules 216 with the hydroxyl oxygen atom. However, this interaction cannot be directly classiﬁed as 217 a hydrogen-bond interaction, since the probability of observing these structures during the 218 simulations was negligible.
219 Hydrogen bond dynamics and solvent orientation
Figure 5: Panel (a) shows the continuous hydrogen bond auto-correlation functions for O· · ·Hw pairs in the bulk aqueous and air-water interface environments. Panel (b) shows the continuous hydrogen bond auto-correlation functions for H· · ·Ow pair in the bulk aqueous and air-water interface environments. 220 The acetic acid molecule contains carbonyl (–C=O) and hydroxyl (–OH) groups, both of
12

221 which can form hydrogen bonds with neighboring water molecules in the bulk and interfacial 222 conﬁgurations. To gain a deeper understanding of the strength and dynamic stability of 223 these hydrogen bonds, we calculated a continuous hydrogen bond auto-correlation function 224 using a population correlation function approach.59–62 The continuous hydrogen bond auto225 correlation function describes the probability that a selective hydrogen-bonded pair continues 226 to be hydrogen-bonded up to a time t, which is deﬁned by the following equation:

SHB(t) =

hij(0)Hij(t) . hij (0)2

(3)

227 The variables hij and Hij are the hydrogen bond population operators that account for the

228 distance between i and j pairs. The bracket indicates an average of all types of hydrogen

229 bond pairs. The operator, hij, is unity when a particular type of hydrogen bonding pair is

230 hydrogen-bonded at time t and zero otherwise. Likewise, Hij is equal to 1 if a hydrogen

231 bond continuously exists from time 0 to t; otherwise, it is zero. The lifetime, τHB, associated

232 with the hydrogen bond auto-correlation function can be calculated via the integration of

233 equation 3:

∞

τHB = SHB(t)dt.

0

234 In the present case, we calculated continuous hydrogen bond auto-correlation functions for

235 O· · ·Hw and H· · ·Ow pairs, which are shown in Figure 5. Based on bulk-water simulations, 236 Luzar and Chandler59–61 developed geometric criteria for designating hydrogen bonding such

237 that the O-O distance should be ≤ 3.35 ˚A, and the corresponding hydrogen bond cut-oﬀ

238 angle is 30◦. We used a cut-oﬀ angle of 45◦ to designate an acetic acid-water hydrogen bond

239 in the current work. In other studies, a cut-oﬀ angle of 30◦ was used, but a less stringent

240 cut-oﬀ angle of 45◦ can also be utilized for water-solute hydrogen bond interactions.

241 Our calculated results reveal that the O· · ·Hw hydrogen-bond auto-correlation function

242 (Figure 5a) decays rapidly compared to that of H· · ·Ow (Figure 5b). The O· · ·Hw hydrogen

243 bond correlation functions converged to zero within 2 ps, while the H· · ·Ow correlation func-

13

244 tions converged to zero within 20 ps. The faster decay of the O· · ·Hw hydrogen bond pair 245 indicates that acetic acid forms weaker hydrogen bonds with neighboring water molecules

246 via the carbonyl moiety. We ﬁtted the correlation decays to a single exponential function

247 to obtain respective lifetime values of the hydrogen bond pairs, which are shown in Table 1.

248 The lifetimes for the O· · ·Hw pairs in the bulk aqueous and air-water interface conﬁgurations 249 are similar. In addition, when the temperature is increased from 300 to 330 K, the lifetime

250 of the O· · ·Hw pair slightly decreases. The longer lifetime of the H· · ·Ow pair in the bulk 251 aqueous environment at 300 K compared to the air-water interface indicates a more stable

252 hydrogen bond formation in the bulk environment. In addition, we also observed that the

253 lifetime of the H· · ·Ow pair at the interface increases with temperature. Overall, the lifetime 254 of the H· · ·Ow pair is long compared to the O· · ·Hw pair in both the bulk aqueous and air255 water interface environments. We also calculated the time-dependent ﬂuctuations of various

256 acetic acid-water hydrogen bonds with the aforementioned hydrogen-bond criteria. Figure

257 S3 in the Supplementary Material shows the time-dependent ﬂuctuations of the hydrogen

258 bonds. The average number of hydrogen bonds are found to be 1.01 and 1.75 for the H· · ·Ow 259 and O· · ·Hw pairs, respectively, in the bulk aqueous environment. The average number of 260 H-bonds is 0.99 at both temperatures for the H· · ·Ow pairs at the air-water interface. Si261 multaneously, the O· · ·Hw pair forms 0.91 (300 K) and 1.37 (330 K) hydrogen bonds at the
air-water interface.

262

263 The hydrogen bond auto-correlation calculations suggest that the H· · ·Ow hydrogen bond 264 pair forms a stronger hydrogen bond than the O· · ·Hw pair in the bulk aqueous environment 265 and at the air-water interface. The O· · ·Hw pair also forms a more robust hydrogen bond

266 in the bulk aqueous environment compared to the air-water interface. To understand this, 267 we performed a plane projection analysis using the TRAVIS software package63,64 shown 268 in Figure 6. In these plane projection calculations, the acetic acid in the bulk aqueous 269 environment and at the air-water interface is ﬁxed. The color scales in Figures 6a and 6b 270 designate the average particle density of water molecules at the given position relative to the 271 uniform density. A value greater than one implies that water can be found at that location 272 compared to some arbitrary position, whereas a value less than one denotes depletion of 273 water molecules at that position. The vectors in Figure 6 describe the average orientation of 274 the dipole vector of the water molecules. From Figures 6a and 6b, we see that the particle 275 density of water molecules near the hydroxyl group is higher compared to the C=O group, 276 with the vectors pointing away from this group. In contrast, there is no clear preferential 277 orientation of the dipole vectors of the water near the C=O group of the acetic acid molecule 278 (in both the bulk and interfacial environments), resulting in very small average vectors.
15

279 Due to this orientation of water molecules, the H· · ·Ow hydrogen bond is stronger than the 280 O· · ·Hw acetic acid-water hydrogen bonds. Comparing the orientation of water molecules 281 around the hydroxyl group in the bulk aqueous environment and at the air-water interface, 282 we ﬁnd that the particle density of water molecules is higher in the bulk conﬁguration, 283 indicating a stronger H· · ·Ow hydrogen bond. For the air-water interface simulations, we 284 observe a slightly higher hydrogen-bond coordination number in conjunction with a lower 285 hydrogen-bond lifetime for the O· · ·Hw pair at 330 K (compared to 300 K). To understand 286 this counter-intuitive behavior, we calculated the combined distribution function (CDF) at 287 300 and 330 K in Figures S4 and S5 within the Supplementary Material. In the various CDF 288 contour plots, the x-axis denotes the O· · ·Hw RDF, and the y-axis represents the hydrogen289 bond cut-oﬀ angle distribution. At 330 K, the hydrogen-bond cut-oﬀ angle distribution is 290 slightly wider but has a lower intensity than the conﬁguration at 300 K. In addition, the 291 ﬁrst minimum of the O· · ·Hw RDF is somewhat shifted towards a larger distance at 330 K. 292 As such, even though the O· · ·Hw RDF has a slightly higher coordination number, the longer 293 O· · ·Hw distance and wider hydrogen-bond cut-oﬀ angle make it marginally weaker at 330 294 K.
295 Free energy proﬁle
296 In this section, we further analyze the free energy proﬁle of acetic acid in a bulk aqueous 297 environment and at the air-water interface. To enable a critical assessment of acetic acid de298 protonation dynamics, longer simulations as well as a precise selection of collective variables 299 is essential. The well-tempered metadynamics simulations in the present study were carried 300 out by acquiring a single collective variable (CV), denoted as CV1, which is the coordination 301 number from O to H, as shown in Figure 1c. 302 Figure 7 depicts the free energy proﬁle for acetic acid deprotonation in a bulk aqueous 303 environment from trajectory 01, which was generated by well-tempered metadynamics sim304 ulations. Initially, CV1 ﬂuctuates near ≈ 0.90 ˚A, and after 5.45 ps, the system departs from

305 the reactant well to the product well, as observed by the change in CV1 values. After this 306 point, CV1 changes from 0.9 to 0.1 and ﬂuctuates between 0.1 to 0.5 angstroms. After 11 ps, 307 CV1 ﬂuctuates around 0 (i.e., the O-H bond of acetic acid breaks). The reactant well (R) 308 is positioned at ≈ 0.90 (see Figure 7b), which indicates an intact acetic acid molecule that 309 is hydrogen-bonded to neighboring water molecules. The free energy value corresponding 310 to the R state is -32.95 kJ/mol which manifests itself as a deep single-centered well. The 311 dissociated acetic acid product, P, is deﬁned by CV1 ≈ 0.1, and the transition state (TS) is 312 located between the R and P states. The corresponding CV1 value for the transition state 313 is ≈ 0.65. The free energy value for the TS is -6.55 kJ/mol, which corresponds to a free 314 energy activation barrier of 26.4 kJ/mol for acetic acid deprotonation in the bulk aqueous 315 environment. The reactant, transition state, and product for the acetic acid deprotonation
17

316 in the bulk aqueous environment are shown in Figure 7c. In the Supplementary Material, we 317 present an additional free energy proﬁle (Figure S6) from trajectory 02 that utilizes diﬀerent 318 initial conditions in the bulk aqueous environment. Figure S6(a) represents ﬂuctuations of 319 CV1 values, and Figure S6(b) shows the free energy proﬁle. In this case, the reactant pro320 ceeds towards the product state via a stable transition state with a free energy barrier value 321 of 29.65 kJ/mol. A tiny minimum (corresponding to the contact ion pair) is also observed 322 between the reactant and transition state. The free energy path is very similar to the earlier 323 study obtained by Park et al.,28 which uses a more complex metadynamics approach with 324 three collective variables. As such, the average free energy value from these two independent 325 trajectories is 28.025 kJ/mol. Our calculated free energy activation barrier is very close to the 326 CPMD metadynamics result obtained by Tummanapelli et al. for acetic acid deprotonation 327 in a bulk aqueous environment.65 However, we note an apparent discrepancy between our 328 result and the one obtained by Tummanapelli et al. for the free energy diﬀerence between 329 the product and reactant, which deserves further explanation. Speciﬁcally, the free energy 330 proﬁle by Tummanapelli et al. was obtained from a short metadynamics trajectory of 5.2 ps, 331 which actually compares well with our unconverged, intermediate free energy proﬁle obtained 332 after 6.75 ps (cf. Figure S7 in the Supplementary Material). Moreover, Daub et al.66 recently 333 criticized the results by Tummanapelli et al. due to their short metadynamics trajectory in 334 conjunction with additional issues with their simulations.65 As such, the unconverged free 335 energy proﬁle obtained from the short metadynamics simulations by Tummanapelli et al. 336 is unreliable compared to our long-time metadynamics results (cf. convergence plots as a 337 function of simulation time in Figure S8 of the Supplementary Material). 338 Compared to other similar systems, our calculated free energy barriers are somewhat 339 higher, such as the 14.8±0.8,66 14.8,31 and 17.2 kJ/mol67 activation barriers for formic 340 acid deprotonation in bulk water. The observed high activation barrier for acetic acid vs. 341 formic acid deprotonation in the bulk is due to the inductive eﬀect of the methyl group 342 in acetic acid.65 We have also calculated various distances between the carboxylate oxygen
18

343 and neighboring hydrogen atoms from our metadynamics simulations of the bulk aqueous 344 environment, shown in Figure S9 in the Supplementary Material. The calculations suggest 345 that the neighboring hydrogen atoms remain hydrogen-bonded to these carboxylate oxygen 346 atoms, and no re-protonation occurred during these simulations. To assess the convergence 347 of the metadynamics simulations in the bulk aqueous environment, we show the gradual 348 build-up of the free energy proﬁle as a function of the CV (Figure S7 in the Supplementary 349 Material) and calculate the free energy diﬀerence between the transition state and reactant 350 as a function of time (Figure S8 in the Supplementary Material). This analysis, along with 351 the ﬂuctuation of CV values, suggests that our metadynamics simulations are converged.
Figure 8: (a) Fluctuations in CV1 obtained from well-tempered metadynamics simulations as a function of time at the air-water interface. (b) Free energy landscape of acetic acid deprotonation at the aqueous interface is calculated from well-tempered metadynamics simulations. (c) Reactant (R), transition state (TS), and product (P) obtained from the well-tempered metadynamics simulations. 352 The reconstructed free energy surface for the deprotonation of acetic acid at the air-water 353 interface from the trajectory 01 is shown in Figure 8. The initial geometry for the well354 tempered metadynamics at the air-water interface was obtained from the NVT simulations
19

355 at 300 K, and the dynamics of CV1 at the air-water interface are shown in Figure 8a. The 356 dynamical behavior of CV1 suggests that all the available reactant and product regions 357 are suﬃciently explored, and the free energy proﬁle is converged. In this well-tempered 358 metadynamics simulation, the deprotonation of acetic acid at the air-water interface proceeds 359 from product to reactant via a single transition state, as shown in Figure 8b. Two well-deﬁned 360 minima can be observed in the free energy proﬁle. The minimum at 0.90 corresponds to the 361 un-dissociated neutral acetic acid, and the minimum at 0.20 refers to the dissociated acetate 362 anion. The transition state barrier for the deprotonation (labeled as TS in the free energy 363 proﬁle) is located between the R and P states. The CV1 value for the transition state is 0.66, 364 which corresponds to a free energy barrier of 20.30 kJ/mol for acetic acid deprotonation at 365 the air-water interface. The reactant (R), transition state (TS), and product (P) are shown 366 in Figure 8c. In the reactant state, the hydroxyl group of acetic acid is hydrogen-bonded to 367 a water molecule. In the transition state, the hydroxyl group of acetic acid is still hydrogen368 bonded to the water molecule, but the bond length in the hydroxyl O-H group is stretched. 369 In the product state, the hydroxyl O-H group in the acetic acid molecule is broken, and the 370 proton is shifted to a neighboring water molecule, forming a hydronium (H3O+) ion. Figures 371 S10-S11 in the Supplementary Material give a detailed analysis and conﬁrmation of the free 372 energy convergence between the transition state and product basin. We have performed 373 additional metadynamics calculations (using diﬀerent initial conditions) for the air-water 374 interface. The ﬂuctuations of CV1 values and free energy proﬁles are shown in Figure S12 in 375 the Supplementary Material. In this case, the reactant goes to the product state via a single 376 transition state with a free energy barrier value of 21.03 kJ/mol. The average free energy 377 barrier value obtained from the diﬀerent initial conditions is 20.66 kJ/mol. A 7.5 kJ/mol 378 free energy barrier was previously reported for DFT-based metadynamics simulations of 379 formic acid (a similar carboxylic acid).31 As such, our computed free energy barrier for the 380 acetic acid deprotonation is higher than that of formic acid at the air-water interface. The 381 various distances between the carboxylate oxygen and neighboring hydrogen atoms of water
20

382 molecules at the air-water interface are shown in Figure S13 of the Supplementary Material. 383 These calculations suggest that re-protonation does not occur after acetic deprotonation at 384 the air-water interface within the time scales probed in our simulations. 385 The slightly lower free energy barrier for the slab conﬁguration indicates that acetic acid 386 deprotonates faster at an air-water interface than in a bulk aqueous environment. A com387 prehensive analysis of the solvation shell structure and hydrogen bond dynamics of acetic 388 acid-water in the bulk aqueous environment and at the interface is less clear since almost 389 the same average number of hydrogen bonds are formed by the hydroxyl group. Previous 390 studies on the deprotonation of formic31 and carbonic acid68 at the air-water interface pro391 posed that faster deprotonation may be due to faster water re-orientation/hydrogen bond 392 dynamics or second-solvation shell eﬀects. To precisely assess these eﬀects, we carried out 393 RDF calculations between the hydroxyl oxygen of acetic acid and the oxygen atom of the 394 surrounding water molecules. Figure S14 shows the O-Ow RDF calculations in the bulk 395 aqueous environment and at the air-water interface in the Supplementary Material. The 396 O-Ow RDF at the air-water interface indicates that the water molecules are well structured 397 around the hydroxyl (O-H) group, even up to the third solvation shell. This is in stark 398 contrast with the O-Ow RDF in the bulk aqueous environment, where second and third sol399 vation shells are not well structured (i.e., water molecules exceeding the ﬁrst solvation shell 400 are randomly arranged). Therefore, we suggest that the eﬀect of the solvation shell could 401 be one reason for faster deprotonation at the air-water interface. Recently, surface-sensitive 402 measurements using online electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (OESI-MS) of acetic 403 acid and pyruvic acids suggested enhanced acidity of these carboxylic acids on the surface 404 of water.18 Francisco and co-workers further reported that the pKa value and redox poten405 tial at the air-water interface diﬀered from a bulk aqueous environment.69,70 Their study 406 also inferred that the air-water interface provides an energetically favorable environment for 407 redox reactions. All of these prior studies collectively demonstrate that the enhancement 408 of acidities could be another reason for the lower small free energy barrier for acetic acid
21

409 deprotonation at the air-water interface, which supports our metadynamics simulations. 410 The behavior of acetic acid at the air-water interface is qualitatively diﬀerent than the 411 dynamics of strong acids. For example, hydrochloric (HCl) acid has a small free energy 412 barrier for the deprotonation at the interface as in the bulk.71 On the other hand, nitric 413 acid (HNO3) has an exceptionally high free energy barrier of deprotonation at the interface 414 due to an inadequate solvation shell and its extraordinary stability.71–73 However, all the 415 carboxylic acids have a strong surface propensity: the faster deprotonation at the interface 416 could indicate that the role of these weak acids in acidifying the polluted atmosphere, water 417 droplets, rain, and cloud water may be more critical than initially thought.
418 Conclusions
419 In this study, we have carried out extensive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of 420 acetic acid to understand and contrast its dynamical eﬀects in a bulk aqueous vs. an air421 water interface environment. Our calculations demonstrate that acetic acid is particularly 422 surface-active and remains near the air-water interface at all temperatures. Furthermore, 423 our hydrogen-bond analysis indicates that the H· · ·Ow hydrogen bond is more dominant 424 than the O· · ·Hw hydrogen bond between acetic acid and neighboring water molecules, which 425 arises due to the higher particle density of water molecules around the hydroxyl (OH) group. 426 Our calculations suggest a negligible diﬀerence in the hydrogen bond lifetime of the O· · ·Hw 427 pair in either the bulk aqueous environment or at the air-water interface at 300 K. We also 428 observed a faster decay of the O· · ·Hw hydrogen-bond pair as a function of temperature 429 at the interface. However, a slower decay of the H· · ·Ow pair was observed in the bulk 430 aqueous environment compared to the air-water interface due to a higher particle density. 431 Furthermore, deprotonation of acetic acid in either the bulk or interfacial environments was 432 not observed. Our ab initio metadynamics simulations provide an atomistic-level picture of 433 the reaction path, as well as numerical predictions of the energetic landscape in both bulk
22

434 and air-water environments. Using ab initio-based metadynamics to predict the free energy 435 proﬁle of the deprotonation process, we have shown that the surface free energy barrier 436 is lower than its bulk value. Our ﬁndings suggest that this reduction of the free energy 437 barrier at the air-water interface is due to a well-structured solvation shell. Collectively, our 438 metadynamics calculations (1) show that acetic acid deprotonation occurs more readily on 439 an aqueous surface than in a bulk water environment and (2) provide additional, critical 440 mechanistic insight into acid-base reactions at the air-water interface.
