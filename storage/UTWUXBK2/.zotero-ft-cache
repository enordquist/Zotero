The effects of sodium halide salts on the hydration and effective interaction between two nanometer-sized, spherical hydrophobic solutes are studied using explicit-water molecular dynamics computer simulations. The system exhibits bimodal wet–dry hydration oscillations that are found to be signiﬁcantly shifted to dryer states by the presence of salt at and above physiological concentrations. We ﬁnd that the wet–dry equilibrium of the conﬁned solvent and the resulting interaction between the two solutes can be sensitively tuned by varying the salt type and concentration. A free energy analysis indicates that the strong salt effects can be traced back to large changes in the water chemical potential for the transfer process of a water molecule from the bulk reservoir into the ion-depleted conﬁned region. Our results provide a better understanding of salt effects at the onset of aggregation and self-assembly of large hydrophobic solutes such as globular proteins.

1. Introduction
The hydrophobic effect is one of the major driving forces in the self-assembly of aqueous soft matter systems and is thus of fundamental importance in physical chemistry and biology. Over the past decade, much progress has been made in understanding the hydrophobic interaction, in particular, the distinction between the qualitatively different hydration behaviour on small and large length scales [1,2]. The hydrogen bond network of bulk water is only moderately distorted around small, convex solutes upon hydration, while for larger solutes, beyond a crossover length scale of about 1 nm, structural changes of the network in the hydration shell are much more pronounced. In the latter regime hydration free energies scale with solute surface area, and concepts from macroscopic interfacial thermodynamics apply. Indeed, under nanometer-scale hydrophobic conﬁnement, water can display capillary evaporation, i.e., a complete ‘dewetting’ or ‘drying’ of the conﬁned solvent takes place, mainly driven by minimisation of the unfavourable solute–solvent contact area [3,4]. Hydrophobic drying gives rise to large, attractive forces between solutes, which have been argued to be a key mechanism for folding and aggregation of proteins [4–6] and to control their physiological function, in particular, in ion channels [3,7–10].
Aqueous assembly processes of hydrophobic solutes normally take place in the presence of counter-ions and

salt. Since the pioneering work of Hofmeister, more than a century ago, it is well known that ions have a speciﬁc inﬂuence on solute aggregation, partly due to their impact on the hydrophobic interaction [11,12]. A full understanding of the degree to which ions inﬂuence hydrophobic interactions on various length scales is still lacking. Detailed molecular insight can be gained from atomistic explicit-water molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. Using such simulations, Ghosh et al. observed the relative stabilisation of compact conformations of a hydrophobic polymer by added salt, accompanied by a clear depletion of salt and a slight enhancement of water density in the vicinity of the solute [13]. Their ﬁndings depended on the nature and concentration of salt, as well as on the length scale of the conformational change. Zangi and Berne showed that aggregates of 0.5 -nm-sized hydrophobic particles can form or dissolve in response to changes in the charge density of the ions [14]. Later they investigated salt effects on the solvent-mediated attraction and drying between two larger, planar hydrophobic surfaces (platelets) [15 ]. They found a strong correlation between the strength of the hydrophobic interaction and the degree of preferential binding/exclusion of the ions relative to the nanometric surfaces. A more recent MD study of a similar system consistently found that different salt solutions have a different inﬂuence on the surface– surface interaction and on the onset of the wetting–drying transition [16].

In the present work, we extend our previous MD simulation study of drying effects on the hydrophobic interaction between two nanometer-sized spherical solutes [5 ,6] by exploring the inﬂuence of the nature and concentration of added salt on the hydrophobic behaviour. In practice, we consider three sodium salts, namely, NaF, NaCl, and NaBr, and investigate their effect on capillary evaporation and on the hydrophobic interaction between two solutes of 3 nm diameter, when the system is held under physical conditions close to the onset of the drying transition of pure water. We ﬁnd large, ion-speciﬁc increases in the attractive interaction force even for relatively low salt concentrations in the physiological range. An analysis of the free energy resolved in terms of water occupancy of the inter-solute conﬁned region points to a strong correlation of salt effects with large changes of the water chemical potential during the transfer process of a water molecule from the bulk reservoir to the conﬁned region. Our results add further insight into the complexity of salt effects on hydrophobic interactions driven by solvent drying and into the onset of aggregation and self-assembly of large hydrophobic solutes in aqueous electrolyte solutions.

2. Methods
The explicit–water and explicit–ion MD simulations were performed along the lines detailed in our earlier work on the same, albeit ion-free, system [5 ,6]. Brieﬂy, we use the DLPOLY2 MD software package [17] in the NPT ensemble, at a ﬁxed pressure of P = 1 bar and a temperature T = 300 K, with a ﬁxed, total number N of particles. All electrostatic interactions within the periodically repeated sample are calculated by the smooth-particle-mesh Ewald summation method. Due to large solvent density ﬂuctuations close to the dewetting transition on a ∼100 ps timescale, we generate phase space trajectories of at least 20 ns in each run to ensure sufﬁcient statistics.
The two hydrophobic solutes are assumed to be spherical, homogeneous assemblies of CH2 groups, of a uniform density τ =0.024 A˚ −3, up to a radius R = 15 A˚ , deﬁned as the maximal distance between the centre of a CH2 molecule and the centre of mass of the solute. CH2/CH2 and CH2/H2O interactions are assumed to be of the 12-6 Lennard–Jones (LJ) form, with potential parameters listed in Table 1. Integration of the CH2/H2O LJ potential over the volume of the solute sphere yields an analytical 9-3-like potential Usw(r) describing the interaction between the centre of the parafﬁn-like solute and a water molecule [18]. An estimate of the distance of closest approach of the centres of a water molecule and a solute is provided by the Barker–Henderson prescription [19]:

where β = 1/kBT and Usrwep(r) is the repulsive part of the solute–water potential. The intrinsic solute–solute interaction Uss(r) as a function of the centre-to-centre distance r = r12 is obtained by a similar integration of the uniformly distributed CH2–CH2 LJ interactions over the volumes of the two solutes. The water–water interaction is modelled by the SPC/E potential [20]. The corresponding LJ parameters and atomic partial charges are listed in Table 1.
The hydration of the two solutes is studied for a ﬁxed solute surface-to-surface distance s = r12 − 2R. The two solutes are placed on the body diagonal of a periodically repeated cubic box containing Nw = 45 00 water molecules. The resulting average box lengths at P = 1 bar lie between L = (5 6.1 ± 0.1)A˚ and L = (5 7.0 ± 0.1)A˚ depending on salt concentration. The box dimensions are chosen such that the surface-to-surface distance to the nearest solute image is at least 20 A˚ . The ions are modelled by charged, nonpolarisable LJ spheres, using potential parameters appropriate for the monovalent salts NaF, NaCl, and NaBr. Their LJ parameters are the same as used by Bhatt et al. [21] for the calculation of water–salt surface tensions. The LJ parameters are summarised in Table 1. The ion–solute interaction has the same functional 9-3-like form as the water–solute potential, using the appropriate LJ parameters for the ions. Cross interactions are calculated using the Lorentz–Berthelot mixing rules. Salt concentrations ranging from 0.12 M up to 4.01 M were considered involving between 10 to 328 anion–cation pairs. Note that experimentally NaF is not soluble in water above ≃1 M. Due to its strong pairing tendency in bulk water (implying a low osmotic pressure), NaF serves as a model of a salt which is strongly excluded from the hydrophobic solute environment.
3. Results and discussion
We ﬁrst consider the two hydrophobic spheres in pure SPC/E water, i.e., in the absence of added salt. A clear dewetting transition is observed in the region conﬁned between the solutes for surface-to-surface distances s s0 = 7 A˚ , a behaviour consistent with our previous result for hard sphere solutes [5 ,6]. Note that the present model includes solute–solvent attraction that tends to inhibit dewetting between hydrophobic, plate-like solutes [22]. In accordance with the latter trend, we indeed observed stronger dewetting when the solute–solvent attraction were switched off [5 ,6].
Upon increasing the surface-to-surface separation by 1 A˚ to s = 8 A˚ , we observe that water ﬁlls the inter-solute region intermittently; on average, the region remains preferentially ﬁlled throughout the whole duration of the simulation. The normalised water oxygen density distribution ρ(r⃗)/ρ0 around the solutes is displayed in Figure 1(a), showing that roughly two water layers stably ﬁt into the region conﬁned between the solutes; this is compatible with the

solute–water distance of closest approach in Equation (1) and the surface-to-surface distance s = 8 A˚ . In the following, we deﬁne this region as the cylindrically symmetric volume V accessible to the water molecules between the two solutes, with a radial extension of 6.5 A˚ [see the rectangular boxes in the colour maps in Figure 1(a)]. In the ﬁlled state, the mean number of water molecules (or ‘water occupancy’) within that volume is N ≃ 21. The time-resolved plot of the occupancy N(t), shown in Figure 1(a) over a 10 ns sequence, conﬁrms the intermittent ﬁlling by water molecules. Random switches between ﬁlled (‘liquid’) and empty (‘vapour’) states on a ∼100 ps timescale have been previously reported in computer simulations of water between hydrophobic plates or in carbon nanotubes and ion channels [3,7–10], and point to a bimodal behaviour of the water free energy G(N) as a function of occupancy. By evaluating the mean occupancy over the whole duration of the simulation, we ﬁnd a probability p = 0.22 that the reference volume V is empty.
The signiﬁcant change of the ﬁlled state probability upon varying the solute–solute distance has a strong impact on the mean hydrophobic force F between the solutes. While for distances s 7 A˚ , we ﬁnd a strong attraction

F∗ = βFA˚ ≃ −7, compared to the solute–solute dispersion attraction (Fd∗is ≃ −0.1), the absolute force drops sharply to F∗ ≃ −2 for s = 8 A˚ and F∗ ≃ −0.5 for s = 9 A˚ . From a macroscopic point of view the hydrophobic attrac-
tion energy W(s) is often estimated as the product of the
liquid–vapour surface tension γ and the interfacial area A.
In the present case, assuming a cylindrical vapour bubble of length s and radius r = 6.5 A˚ between the spheres, and using the SPC/E water surface tension γ = 0.174 kBT/A˚ 2 [23], we arrive at F = −∂W/∂s = −2π γ r ≃ −7.11kB T /A˚ for s 7 A˚ (where drying occurs), close to the MD result F∗ ≃ −7. In the following, we focus on the critical distance s = 8 A˚ , at which the pure solvent just wets the opposite surfaces
in order to investigate the inﬂuence of salt type and concen-
tration on the wetting/dewetting behaviour at the threshold
of pure solvent dewetting.
Upon addition of salt, the probability of the depleted
‘vapour’ state is found to increase sharply. This is exempli-
ﬁed in Figure 1(b), which shows the water oxygen density
and the time-resolved water occupancy N(t) for a 0.12 M
NaF solution. In this case, an intermittent nanobubble is
detected between the spherical solutes (with a radial extension of about 6.5 A˚ ) during 68% of the simulation time.

Figure 2. Reduced mean force F∗ = βFA˚ between two hydrophobic solutes at a surface-to-surface distance s = 8 A˚ vs. NaF molar concentration c, for neutral (circles) and oppositely charged (squares) solutes with Q = ± 5 e. The reduced forces are also shown for NaCl and NaBr at concentrations c = 0.06 and 4.01 M. The inset shows the probability p of ﬁnding a dry state vs. NaF concentration.
This much enhanced tendency towards dewetting is accompanied by a strong enhancement of the mean force between the solutes, from F∗ ≃ −2.01 in the absence of salt to F∗ ≃ −5 .12 for the 0.12 M NaF solution, corresponding to a more than twofold increase of the amplitude of the force. The variation of the mean force is plotted in Figure 2 over a wide range of NaF concentrations. After the steep increase of F∗ at low concentrations (c 0.25 M) to |F∗| ≃ 5 , the amplitude of the attraction slowly and monotonically increases further to a value |F∗| ≃ 6 for c = 4 M salt. This increase is again strongly correlated with the probability p of ﬁnding a vapour bubble between the solutes, as shown in the inset to Figure 2: p is seen to increase rapidly to p ≃ 0.7 at low NaF concentrations, and subsequently rises to p = 0.8 for 4.01 M NaF. Upon replacing NaF by NaCl or NaBr at selected salt concentrations (0.12 and 4.01 M), the magnitude of the attraction and the dewetting probability p decreases in the order NaF > NaCl > NaBr by around 10% and 20%, respectively, as shown for the forces in Figure 2. This observation underlines the fact that saltinduced effects on the dewetting behaviour of hydrophobic solutes are ion-speciﬁc and follow a Hofmeister series, a trend reminiscent of protein solubility [11,12].
We have also investigated the effect of charging the solutes by ﬁxing opposite point charges Q = ± 5 e at the centres of the two solutes. As observed in our earlier investigations, dewetting in the salt-free case is strongly suppressed by the electric ﬁeld generated by the oppositely charged spheres, which attracts the dipolar water molecules towards the region between the solutes, where the electric ﬁeld is strongest [5 ,6]. The amplitude of the mean total force between the solutes drops to |F∗| = 0.5 9, which is now of the order of magnitude of the direct Coulombic interaction

reduced by the dielectric permittivity ϵ ≃ 80 of the solvent, |FC∗| = 0.12. The discrepancy between the two values points to incomplete dipolar screening of the Coulomb interaction, as may be expected for highly conﬁned water (of which only two layers form in the conﬁned region between the charged solutes). Similarly to the case of uncharged solutes, the addition of salt favours dewetting, and hence increases the magnitude of the hydrophobic attraction as illustrated in Figure 2. We emphasise that this enhancement is opposite to the familiar reduction of electrostatic interactions by salt screening, and is a signature of the enhancement of the dewetting effect by added salt. There is hence a competition between the screening and dewetting effects of ions in the case of oppositely charged solutes. This explains why the maximum amplitude of the attractive force |F∗| ≃ 2.7 for a 4 M NaF solution, while representing a more than fourfold increase compared to the salt-free case, remains a factor of two smaller than for uncharged solutes (cf. Figure 2).
Throughout the remainder of this paper, we restrict the discussion to the case of neutral solutes in an attempt to gain a clearer understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to the enhancement of dewetting and hydrophobic attraction by added salt. We ﬁrst examine the density distribution of the salt ions, as illustrated in Figure 3 for the distribution of Na + ions of a 0.5 M NaF solution around the two solutes. The central, most conﬁned region is clearly ion-depleted; the ion-depleted/ion-rich interface occurs at a radial distance of about 9.5 A˚ from the axis joining the centres of the two solutes, which is about 3 A˚ larger than the location of the average solvent liquid–vapour interface shown in Figure 1(b). More generally we ﬁnd that ions never penetrate the conﬁned region V within the time interval of at least 20 ns explored by the simulations, independently of salt type or concentration.

of even a small amount of salt (c = 0.12 M) destabilises the ﬁlled state in favour of a stable empty (‘vapour’) state with N ≃ 0. Figure 4 shows that the ﬁlled state becomes less and less stable relative to the empty state as c increases. The free energy barrier between the stable empty and the metastable ﬁlled states increases with concentration up to
G ≃ 2.5 kBT for c = 4 M. As shown in the inset of Figure 4, the free energy curves G(N; c) for different concentrations can be mapped onto each other by a simple linear scaling with occupation number N:

G(N ; c) = G(N; c = 0) + g(c)N + b(c)

Figure 4. Water Gibbs free energy G(N) as a function of water occupancy number N in the region conﬁned between the two hydrophobic solutes at a surface-to-surface distance s = 8 A˚ in the salt-free case (circles) and for increasing NaF concentration (cf. legend). The inset shows the collapse of the data for different salt concentrations according to the mapping of Equation (3).

From a macroscopic point of view, ion depletion can be attributed in part to the image charge repulsion close to the solutes of low dielectric permittivity compared to that of water. More importantly the ions must overcome a large free energy barrier when they attempt to penetrate into the hydrophobic conﬁnement zone, since they must shed their solvation shells to ‘squeeze’ into the narrow zone. A similar free energy barrier has been reported for ions permeating narrow hydrophobic ion channels [9,10]. This behaviour plays a major role for a qualitative understanding of the strongly enhanced dewetting of water with increasing salt concentration. We note that the degree of salt depletion follows the Hofmeister series NaF > NaCl > NaBr, and appears thus to be closely related to the order of ion effects on drying and the mean solvation force reported earlier in this paper.
Time-resolved water occupancy curves N(t), like those shown in Figure 1, allow us to obtain an estimate of the probability p(N) of ﬁnding N water molecules in the conﬁnement volume V. The occupancy-dependent Gibbs free energy G(N) is then given, within a state-dependent constant, by the relation

βG = −ln[p(N )].

(2)

The variation of βG(N) with N for four NaF concentrations is shown in Figure 4. As expected from the intermittent ﬁlling N(t), the free energy curves exhibit a bimodal behaviour, with local minima at low and high occupancy. In the salt-free case, the stable minimum corresponds to the ﬁlled state with N ≃ 22, while a shallow minimum occurs at the vapour state N ≃ 6. The free energy barrier between the stable and metastable states is about 1.5 kBT. The addition

with g(c = 0) = b(c = 0) = 0, while βg(c) = 0.12, 0.16, 0.19 for c = 0.12, 1.0, 4.01 M, respectively. The linear dependence of G(N; c) = G(N; c) −G(N; c = 0) on N hints at a simple thermodynamic interpretation of the prefactor g(c). The migration of a water molecule from the (ion-rich) bulk solution to the (ion-depleted) region enclosed by the solute spheres may be regarded as the transfer of a water molecule from a salt solution to a pure aqueous phase. The free energy cost of such a transfer is the excess chemical potential µex(c). Water activity measurements of simple electrolyte solutions show that µex(c) increases roughly linearly from 0 to µex(c) ≃ 0.35 kBT at saturation [24]. The values of g(c) reported above are of the same order of magnitude and follow a similar trend, despite the fact that we are dealing here with a highly conﬁned inhomogeneous system. Note, however, that g(c = 0.12M) is considerably larger than its bulk equivalent µex(c) ≃ 0.01 − 0.03 kBT [24]; this may be due to subtle inhomogeneous electrostatic screening effects at low concentration associated with the conﬁnement. Similar screening effects are expected to affect the transfer of ions from the highly depleted region to the bulk solution [25 ].
4. Concluding remarks
In summary, we have provided strong evidence that the addition of monovalent salt at physiological and higher concentrations has dramatic effects on the hydrophobic interaction between nanometer-sized, spherical solutes. Our simulations show that the system undergoes a dry to wet hydration transition in the volume conﬁned between two hydrophobic solutes at a surface-to-surface distance of two to three water layers; the transition reacts sensitively to changes in the composition of the solution. The salts that were investigated are preferentially excluded from the conﬁned hydrophobic region due to image charge and hydration effects which shift the dry–wet transition to signiﬁcantly dryer stater. The balance between the two states can be tuned by varying salt type and concentration, which considerably affect the mean hydrophobic force between the solutes. A striking observation is that the importance of ionic dewetting effects increases rapidly at low (physiological) salt concentrations

before saturating at higher concentrations (typically for c 0.5 M), as illustrated in Figure 2.
A free energy analysis shows that in the presence of salt, the key mechanism is a signiﬁcantly altered transfer free energy of water from the bulk solution into the conﬁned, ion-depleted region between the solutes. While one reason is the change in water activity with salt concentration, as expected from macroscopic solution thermodynamics, we suspect that local electrostatic potentials may play an important part, since they appear to be effectively screened by the addition of a small amount of salt. Conﬁrmation of this conjecture requires further simulations and analysis and would be a worthwhile objective of future work. Current theories of hydrophobic solvation and dewetting do not account for those complex ionic effects [1–4] and may beneﬁt from more detailed simulations insights on electrowetting [26] and more ab-initio like theories of electrostatic interactions in critical solvents [27,28].
Finally, our results have demonstrated that salt-induced effects on the dewetting behaviour of hydrophobic solutes are ion-speciﬁc and follow a Hofmeister series, just as protein solubility does [11,12]. Thus, our ﬁndings may be useful to understand salt-speciﬁc effects in the aggregation and self-assembly of proteins.
