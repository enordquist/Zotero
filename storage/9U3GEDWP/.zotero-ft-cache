Protein structure prediction, fold recognition, homology
modeling and design rely mainly on statistical effective energy
functions. Although the theoretical foundation of such
functions is not clear, their usefulness has been demonstrated
in many applications. Molecular mechanics force fields,
particularly when augmented by implicit solvation models,
provide physical effective energy functions that are beginning
to play a role in this area.

Introduction
Approaches to protein structure prediction are based on the
thermodynamic hypothesis, which postulates that the native
state of a protein is the state of lowest free energy under
physiological conditions. Normally, this state corresponds to
the lowest basin of the effective energy surface. The term
‘effective energy’ or ‘potential of mean force’ refers to the
free energy of the system (protein plus solvent) for a fixed
protein conformation; that is, it consists of the intramolecular
energy of the protein plus the solvation free energy [1,2].
Although the vibrational entropy of the folded state is large
[3], it is approximately equal to that of a single unfolded con-
former [4,5]. The large stabilizing entropy of the unfolded
‘state’ arises from the multitude of conformers of similar
energy that contributes to it. It has been suggested that the
native state is surrounded by an ensemble of similar confor-
mations [6]. This appears to be true for a protein like
-lactalbumin, which has a molten globule intermediate that
is stable at low pH [7] and consists of an ensemble of differ-
ent conformers ([8]; E Paci et al ., personal communication).
Although the existence of many such low energy conformers
may aid in the search for a low-resolution model of the native
state, it does not remove the requirement that the native
(active) state be in a deep energy well; otherwise, it would
not be the predominant species at physiological tempera-
tures. In fact, the large increase in entropy between the
native state and conformations that are significantly different
(where ‘significantly different’ is defined by the fact that the
protein is inactive in these non-native conformations) gives
rise to the ‘effective energy gap’ requirement for the stabili-
ty of the native state [9,10].
A counterexample to the full generality of the thermody-
namic hypothesis has been given recently for -lytic
protease, whose native (functional) state appears to be
kinetically trapped. It has been shown to be less stable than
a molten-globule-like intermediate and the denatured state
[11]. As the stability is determined by the free energy of
unfolding (which equals the change in effective energy
between the native state and the denatured states, plus the
increase in conformational entropy on unfolding), this result
is not inconsistent with the conclusion that the native state
is that of lowest effective energy. For -lytic protease, the
measured enthalpy of the native state is lower than that of
the misfolded intermediate by about 18 kcal/mol. Thus, the
stabilization of the latter arises from the increase in confor-
mational and solvation entropy. As has been suggested
previously [12], the native conformation is likely to be lower
in effective energy than any other single conformation, as it
is even for this unusual system. Thus, the demonstration of
kinetic control of folding for some proteins does not neces-
sarily invalidate efforts to predict protein structures via
minimization of an appropriate energy function.
Given the thermodynamic hypothesis, studies of protein
folding (i.e. structure prediction, fold recognition, homolo-
gy modeling and design) generally make use of some form
of effective energy function. There are two very different
types of energy function that are in use. The first is based
on the true effective energy function, which can be
obtained, in principle, from a fundamental analysis of the
forces between the particles; the second is an energy func-
tion based on data derived from known protein structures
(often statistics concerning pair contacts and surface area
burial). We refer to the first type of energy function as a
physical effective energy function (PEEF) and the second
type as a statistical effective energy function (SEEF). The
advantage of PEEFs is that we know that such functions
exist, even if they may be very complicated and not nec-
essarily convenient for protein structure prediction. As
such functions are usually based on an atomic model, they
result in a rough energy surface that does not decrease
smoothly as the native state is approached [13]. However,
a number of optimization techniques for such surfaces
have been developed [14–17]. Several of these try to over-
come the rough energy surface problem by generating a
surface with the same or fewer minima and reduced ener-
gy barriers between them.
SEEFs are based on information from known protein
structures, as mentioned above. Most often, the frequency

distribution of pair distances is used to extract a set of
effective potentials between residues and, as the database
of protein structures has grown, between atom pairs. In
most studies, it has been assumed that a pairwise effective
potential is sufficient. In certain cases, the pairwise terms
have been augmented by introducing additional interac-
tions (e.g. three- and four-body terms, surface area terms,
probabilities of mainchain and sidechain dihedral angles,
and/or whatever appears useful to the people constructing
the SEEF). This lack of constraints on what to include in
a SEEF is both a strength and a weakness of such func-
tions. Some attempts have been made to optimize the
SEEF not only by using known protein structures, but also
by creating misfolded structures and choosing parameters
to maximize the energy gap between them and the native
state ([18–20]; H Holley, personal communication). For
many applications of these functions, it is not necessary
that the whole energy surface is reproduced correctly, only
that the native state has the lowest effective energy. If the
functions are physically meaningful, however, one might
expect that, when they are expressed on an atom–atom
basis, it should be possible to compare the SEEF effective
pair potentials with PEEF values.
PEEFs typically consist of a molecular mechanics energy
function and a model for the effect of solvation on the free
energy. Thus, PEEFs are approximations to the (unknown)
true energy function. They are empirical in that experimen-
tal information is used in the parameterization. However,
the important difference from SEEFs is that the information
used in parameterization of PEEFs is generally not extract-
ed from protein structures, but rather from physical
measurements of simple systems (small-molecule crystal
and solvation data, as well as ab initio calculations); see
MacKerell et al . [21] for a recent example of such parame-
terization for the CHARMM energy function [22] and
Lazaridis and Karplus [23] for an empirical implicit solvation
correction. Although widely used in molecular dynamics
simulations of proteins in their native and denatured states
[24], empirical energy functions and their PEEF extensions
have been out of favor in protein structure prediction
because of their greater computational cost and the impres-
sion that they cannot recognize native folds; the latter reason
is based, in part, on the widely misinterpreted paper by
Novotny et al . [25] (see, also, Lazaridis and Karplus [26]). As
described below, this situation appears to be changing.
The primary emphasis of this review is on effective ener-
gy functions that recognize the native state and can
therefore be used as part of structure prediction, whether
by ab initio , homology-based or threading-based method-
ologies. Protein design is somewhat different. It is not
important if some sequences that might work are excluded
by the design process; rather, it is essential that most
sequences that do not work are excluded. As packing con-
siderations are a major factor in the latter, the primary use
of energy functions has been concerned with excluded vol-
ume effects. For that purpose, PEEF-like functions with
van der Waals terms and core exclusion terms have been
used, augmented secondarily by hydrogen bonding and
other stabilizing terms; such functions have been reviewed
recently by Gordon et al . [27] and we do not consider them
further here.
Reviews of energy functions for protein folding have
appeared almost yearly in this journal [12,19,28–31]. This
review covers recent developments in energy functions
that are intended to describe proteins, rather than energy
functions designed to endow a particular model with pro-
tein-like properties (e.g. Shakhnovich and Gutin [32];
Mirny and Shakhnovich [33]).
Statistical effective energy functions
As outlined above, SEEFs generally use the database of
known protein structures to extract ‘pseudo-potentials’ for
predicting unknown structures. One advantage of SEEFs
over PEEFs, particularly when comparing residue-based
SEEFs with atom-based PEEFs, is that the former tend to
be less sensitive to small displacements. This makes them
more robust for low-resolution protein structure prediction,
for which small errors are inevitable. On the other hand, the
price for this robustness may be a lower discriminatory
power. Another advantage of SEEFs is that, because of
their statistical nature, they can, in principle, include all
known, and possibly unrecognized, physical effects. For
example, the extended-atom model for aromatic rings often
used in PEEFs does not capture cation– interactions,
although this is accounted for in all-atom models. Also,
most PEEFs do not include polarization effects, which
could give rise, for example, to hydrogen-bond cooperativ-
ity; polarizable empirical energy functions for proteins are
under development ([34]; CL Brooks, personal communi-
cation). SEEFs, using known structures as the database,
effectively include such effects, at least approximately.
The theoretical basis of SEEFs has been questioned based
on theory [35] and lattice models [36], although some of the
conclusions of the latter study have been challenged as
being possible artifacts of the simple two-dimensional lat-
tice that was used [37]. It has been shown also that a set of
pairwise contact potentials cannot be constructed to distin-
guish the true energy minimum for even a single protein
[38]. One source of possible artifacts in SEEFs is the lack of
independence of the pair potentials. A striking example is
an attractive interaction at medium range between aspartic
acid residues [39]. This appears to be due to the clustering
of aspartic acid residues around metals, so that the true
potential for this case would be an attractive term between
aspartic acid residues and metal ions. However, the interac-
tion appears as an attraction between aspartic acid residues
in the SEEF and favors incorrectly close positions of aspar-
tic acid residues, even when a metal is not present. Once
understood, such effects can be corrected easily (in this case
by using a database that excludes metal ions, for example),
but it is not straightforward to eliminate all such artifacts
unless they are recognized. This type of criticism has led to
