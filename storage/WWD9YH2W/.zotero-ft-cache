Semiconductor devices are based on controlling the current carried by electrons and holes. Nature, on the other hand, employs ionic and molecular ﬂuxes through phospholipid membranes oﬀering a broader range of mechanisms of control that are selective and responsible for a variety of metabolic and signaling purposes. While natural channels are usually less than a few nanometers in diameter, artiﬁcial nanopores can be produced of diﬀerent dimensions, including much larger diameters and lengths, not only to mimic nature but also to explore new mechanisms of ionic current gating.
Many of these mechanisms have been previously discussed. The most obvious one is physical blockage that happens due to changing of pore dimensions via its expansion/shrinkage or by guest molecules captured inside or translocating through the channel.1À4 Such blockage is diﬃcult to achieve in full for “large” pores and can lead only to some decline in the ionic current through the pore. This decline is proportional to the volume of the molecule(s) that entered the pore, in analogy to operation of a Coulter counter device, hence the volume exclusion mechanism.4 The surface charge mechanism can oﬀer a more signiﬁcant gating of ions through large pores if the overall ion concentration is small. As the name states, the charged walls of the pore exclude ions of the same charge, while ions of the opposite charge maintain electroneutrality and their concentration can exceed that of the ions outside the pore.5 As it was demonstrated experimentally6À8 and theoretically,9,10 this mechanism can be employed for gating current of both ions simultaneously when the pore walls have nonuniform charge distribution. For example, if a nanopore has two halves with oppositely charged walls, the resulting diode would carry ionic current in the open

ABSTRACT Hydrophobicity is a fundamental property that is responsible for numerous physical and biophysical aspects of molecular interactions in water. Peculiar behavior is expected for water in the vicinity of hydrophobic structures, such as nanopores. Indeed, hydrophobic nanopores can be found in two distinct states, dry and wet, even though the latter is thermodynamically unstable. Transitions between these two states are kinetically hindered in long pores but can be much faster in shorter pores. As it is demonstrated for the ﬁrst time in this paper, these transitions can be induced by applying a voltage across a membrane with a single hydrophobic nanopore. Such voltage-induced gating in single nanopores can be realized in a reversible manner through electrowetting of inner walls of the nanopores. The resulting IÀV curves of such artiﬁcial hydrophobic nanopores mimic biological voltage-gated channels.

state greater than that if the walls were neutral. At the same time, the ionic current through such a diode would drop to a much smaller current in the closed state with the opposite bias. The resulting rectiﬁcation factor, the ratio between the open and closed state currents, can exceed 200.6
The third mechanism is based on hydrophobicity switching and has a much more dramatic gating eﬀect that can exceed 6 orders of magnitude in the ionic current variation;11À13 it aﬀects not only ions but also the overall solution ﬂow through the nanopore. The mechanism involves hydrophobic nanopores that are impermeable to water intrusion but can be switched oﬀ (and on) in response to physical or chemical stimuli.11À15 The latter requires engineering of mixed monolayers that have both hydrophobic molecules and sensor molecules making surfaces sensitive to pH,14 light,11 or bioanalytes.15 The pores with large diameter (>20 nm) do not expel water (dewet) even after the surface hydrophobicity is restored. In such pores, despite a greater thermodynamic stability of the dry state with water expelled from the pore, the wetted state is kinetically stalled because of a high activation barrier for dewetting.13,16À21

Hydrophobicity is a fundamental property that is responsible for numerous physical and biophysical aspects of the behavior of nonpolar substances in water. A strong attraction between water molecules, coming from their hydrogen bonding, makes the interaction between water and nonpolar molecules unfavorable and causes water restructuring near hydrophobic surfaces.21 The interplay between hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties is responsible for conformational changes in biologically important molecules and their biochemical functionality. For example, biological membranes with their hydrophobic interior are impermeable to most ions (and many hydrophilic molecules) and rely on the membrane channels that control their transport. The channels employ a variety of mechanisms for eﬃcient and often selective transport of molecules and ions across cell membranes, which is imperative in a large variety of metabolic and signaling purposes, i.e., in sustainable life of organisms. For example, the transmission of nerve impulses depends upon ionic currents generated by the controlled release of ions across membranes. Some ionic channels in the cell membrane are believed to employ the variations between hydrophobic and hydrophilic states that are gated for water and ion ﬂow either by bias or by analytes.22À27 Understanding these mechanisms is important for comprehension of cell functioning; designing of artiﬁcial nanochannels with adaptable hydrophobicity should elucidate the mechanism of the hydrophobicity switching phenomenon.
Here we describe an investigation of ionic conductance in short artiﬁcial hydrophobic nanopores and demonstrate that they can be switched from the dry nonconductive to the wet conductive state by means of applying large enough potential. Our goal is to elucidate this voltage gating mechanism for pores larger than the typical size of membrane channels but short enough for voltage gating realization. In contrast to long nanopores of similar diameters, the conductive state attained in such short hydrophobic nanopores can be made to either retain or retreat with changing bias. A possibility of such control oﬀers new applications in nanopore-based nonlinear elements.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Hydrophobic surfaces are characterized by a contact angle with water, θa, greater than 90°, as is identiﬁed by the Young equation relating the surface tension diﬀerence, Δγ, between the wall/vapor, γwv, and wall/liquid, γwl, interfaces to that of the free liquid/vapor interface, γ:

Δγ ¼ γwv À γwl ¼ γ cos θa

(1)

A hydrophobic nanopore remains dry until the external pressure exceeds the critical value, ΔPo, which depends on Δγ (i.e., on the surface modiﬁcation) and the pore

diameter, D:

ΔPo ¼

À 4γ cos θa D

(2)

The subscript in θa emphasizes that it is a maximum (or critical) advancing angle that a droplet can sustain without moving, which often is noticeably greater than the (minimum) receding angle, θr. Because of this hysteresis and a changing shape of the nanopore entrance, the actual angle of the water meniscus can accept any value in between and changes in response to the altered pressure diﬀerence. Upon reaching the critical pressure for intrusion, ΔPo, the contact angle exceeds the critical one, θa. The value of ΔPo is quite large; even for D = 300 nm and hydrophobic modiﬁcation with a modest advancing contact angle of θa ≈ 100°, its value is ΔPo > 1.6 bar.12 For an electrolyte, instead of just water, its intrusion into the nanopore would cause electrical shorting measurable by a drastic drop in resistance,13 which, as we describe below, in short nanopores can be induced by an increased bias.
Figure 1 illustrates typical current voltage characteristics for two nanopores with similar diameters (120 and 140 nm), the surface of which was hydrophobically modiﬁed by SiH16. At low bias sweeps ((0.1 V in Figure 1A and C), the pores are dry and show very low conductance, corresponding to the trace labeled I in the ﬁgure. Increasing the sweep eventually electrically shorts the pores (1B and 1D) at a high enough critical bias, Uc ≈ 4 V in 1B and Uc ≈ 1 V in 1D. The conductance recovers to almost zero when the bias is lowered, and the procedure can be repeated. If the highest bias value is further increased, the low bias conductance upon return starts showing a partial residual shorting seen as hysteresis in 1B (and trace III), which often leads to recovery of the closed dry state after some time. Further bias increase may result in “complete shorting” (trace IV), the conductance in which coincides with that of the unmodiﬁed pore.
Comparing Figure 1B and D reveals signiﬁcant variability in the current voltage behavior. The nanopore having a diameter of 120 nm (Figure 1D) exhibits almost no hysteresis in a broad range of biases (up to (3 V), in contrast to what is seen for a 140 nm pore with the same modiﬁcation (Figure 1B). The critical bias for shorting is also noticeably smaller, Uc ≈ 1 V for 1D instead of Uc ≈ 4 V for 1B. One can see that there is much greater noise near the critical bias (see Figure 2), which makes it also diﬃcult to deﬁne the value of critical bias precisely.
The possible mechanisms of the observed electrical gating can be divided into two kinds, sketched in Figure 3. The ﬁrst kind does not involve movement of the three-phase contact line along the nanopore wall. Instead, bending of menisci induced by attractive electrostatic forces causes the two waterÀvapor interfaces to overlap. At high enough electric ﬁeld, bending

Figure 1. Typical examples of voltage-induced gating in hydrophobic nanopores with 140 nm diameter (A and B) and 120 nm (C and D) modiﬁed with SiH16. (A) Before hydrophobic modiﬁcation the pore is hydrophilic and shows conductance in agreement with its size (I). After modiﬁcation, the pore is dry despite being in electrolyte (1 M KCl in Tris buﬀer) and shows a
very low conductance at low bias sweeps (II). Increasing the sweep eventually electrically shorts the pore (B) at a high enough bias (Uc ≈ 4 V in the ﬁgure). The conductance recovers to almost zero when the bias is decreased (with a noticeable hysteresis), but with further increase of the sweep it may end up shorted to a partial extent (III) or in full (IV). The latter usually occurs at much larger bias sweeps. The second nanopore (C and D) demonstrates a similar behavior but with signiﬁcantly smaller critical voltage for shorting (Uc ≈ 1 V) that correlates with a measurable conductance in the closed state.

can go beyond just changing the menisci curvature but elongate them analogously to Taylor cone formation at the capillary end in the electrospraying process.28,29 The second kind involves inward movement of the contact lines due to the exerted electrostatic pressure accompanied by changes in the critical contact angle when the voltage across the nanopore is applied. The contact angle change phenomenon is associated with electrowetting. In both kinds, the critical voltage that induces wetting of the initially dry nanopore should depend on the pore dimensions. The primary diﬀerence is that the type of hydrophobic surface modiﬁcation is more decisive for the second kind and is of little importance in the ﬁrst one.
For a negligible conductance through the membrane and the pore walls, an almost linear drop of the applied bias through the gap induces electrostatic attraction of the opposite water menisci and causes them to bend toward each other (see Figure 3B). Because of such bending, it also increases the contact angle at the water/wall surface. The overlap without movement of spherical menisci can occur only when the pore diameter is greater than the pore length, H, even if the contact angle is θa = 180°. Since the critical contact angles are smaller than 180°, such an overlap can be realized without moving the contact line only when the ratio D/H is signiﬁcantly greater than 1. Having a large D/H ratio is not desirable, as there would

(A) The left side corresponds to no movement of the contact line, when electrostatic pressure can only bend the menisci until contact. (B) The case on the right depicts electrowetting initiated by decreasing contact angle due to nonzero surface conductance producing signiﬁcant voltage drop at the contact line, which moves the contact lines of both menisci by electrostatic pressure until contact. The menisci can further bend or develop electrospinning jets in the last stages for cases when the electrowetting-induced change of the contact angle is not signiﬁcant and the contact lines move slowly.

be no thermodynamic advantage for pore dewetting:

the surface area of a cylinder becomes smaller than the

surface area of two hemispheres for D/H > 1. This

critical ratio is actually smaller due to a smaller surface

energy of the water/solid interface than that of water/

vapor. Indeed, we experimentally conﬁrmed that de-

vices with a large aspect ratio, D/H > 1.5, are nonfunc-

tional: they immediately were shorted even with the

modest pressure gradients (<1 atm) used in ﬁlling up

the devices. Devices with D/H ≈ 1 do appear dry and

closed at ﬁrst but never recover the dry state after

having been once electrically shorted (opened). The

length of the nanopores in our experiments was kept at

H = 300 nm because thinner SiN ﬁlms frequently

showed breakdown at voltages above 2 V, as was

veriﬁed before milling the pores.

The shape of menisci can actually be diﬀerent from

spherical. It is well known that electriﬁed liquids can

experience electrohydrodynamic instability under

high electric ﬁelds and produce a thin jet of liquid

above the threshold ﬁeld deﬁned by the surface ten-

sion, γ, and the droplet diameter, D. The droplet

deforms into the Taylor cone with half angle θT ≈ 24.7°.28,29 The eﬀect is often referred to as electrospin-

ning or electrospraying. In the limit of H . D the corresponding critical bias can be estimated:28

Here εο is the permittivity of free space. For the typical dimensions used in this study, D = 150 nm and H = 300 nm, this estimate is quite large, Uc,T ≈ 140 V. Considering an explicit solution for modest H/D would decrease Uc,T but not signiﬁcantly to agree with that experimentally observed. Moreover, eq 3 does not explain the sensitivity to the surface modiﬁcation that is very pronounced. The critical value Uc increases with

increasing the contact angle with water; that is, more hydrophobic ﬂuorinated modiﬁcations lead to much larger Uc (Supporting Information) often beyond the stability of a 300 nm thick SiN membrane, ∼30 V.
As assigned to the second kind, the electrical shorting can also occur as a result of the contact line movement. When menisci are bent by electrostatic interaction, the contact angle at the interface changes and can exceed the critical value θa to allow water intrusion similar to that induced by pressure, as described by eq 2. The exerted electrostatic pressure, Pel, arises from the electrostatic energy, CmU2/2, of a capacitor made of the two water menisci, changing with the gap between them. The latter, at least in the beginning, is close to the membrane thickness, H, leading to an estimate for the capacitance per area of the nanopore as Cm ≈ εo/H, giving the pressure estimate:

According to eq 5, the critical value of Uc,P increases with the (critical) contact angle, which qualitatively agrees with the larger Uc observed using much more hydrophobic ﬂuorinated modiﬁcations.

Then majority of the applied potential drops at the contact lines and reduces the critical contact angle due to electrowetting.
to the range of that experimentally observed. Another approximation above, Pel ≈ ΔPo, also unfavorably increases Uc,P in eq 5. The approximation presumes that the initial hydrostatic pressure inside the pore is the same as outside, but we have eliminated all dissolved gases from the solution and from the cell by degassing and thus made the nanopore ﬁlled only with water vapor. The outside liquid is at atmospheric pressure and produces an additional (nonelectrostatic) gradient slightly less than 1 atm and thus should further lower the threshold bias. Nevertheless, there is no good correlation of the experimental Uc values with the pore diameter (see Supporting Information), as eq 5 would suggest. Thus the electrostatic pressure mechanism, though showing better qualitative correlation with the experiment, still cannot explain the electrical shorting in full.
A better ﬁt to the experimental data can be found when surface electrowetting is taken into account. This mechanism requires a nonzero conductance along the hydrophobic monolayer. As we have demonstrated before with alumina nanoporous membranes, their surface modiﬁcation with hydrophobic silanes (similar to those used in this study) prevents water intrusion, but the ionic conductance along the surface is nonzero and depends on the type and the quality of the surface modiﬁcation.12,13 The values of such surface resistance are generally very large (Rs > 109 Ω per square), but its existence signiﬁcantly alters the charge distribution. Lower Rs causes a greater portion of the voltage drop at the contact lines across the hydrophobic layer (see Figure 4). This permits conditions when electrowetting can alter the surface energy, signiﬁcantly decreasing the

contact angle for the electrostatic pressure to work or even decrease θa below 90°. In electrowetting, the contact angle between an electrolyte and a dielectric of thickness d with dielectric constant εd separating it from a conductor underneath can be decreased by applying a potential, U, between them. The resulting change of the surface energy due to this electrostatic interaction decreases the contact angle:

For the SiH16 modiﬁer with a monolayer thickness of d ≈ 1.6 nm and εd ≈ 2.0, eq 7 suggests that the initial contact angle of θa = 100° can be lowered to less than 90° under a very small voltage drop across the monolayer, Uc,E ≈ 1.5 V. Actually, there is no need for θa to drop below 90°, just lowering it enough eases the way for electrostatic pressure to work. A monolayer that is not perfectly dense has a lower eﬀective thickness and more leakage, thus a lower Uc,E. Note that the critical bias Uc,E depends on the contact angle similar to that of eq 5. It agrees with the above-mentioned higher values of the critical bias for ﬂuorinated surfaces (see Supporting Information), where θa is higher than 110°. Similarly, the devices that were treated by a single cycle of SiH16 silanization have generally lower critical bias voltages as well. However, repeating silanization, which eliminates imperfections left during the ﬁrst step, results in an increasing contact angle with water, θa, and higher critical biases. The typical values on the SiN side of the chip after the ﬁrst silanization are within θa = 95À100°, while after the second they increase to θa = 100À105°. The second silanization improves the packing density of molecules in the monolayer (and thus slightly its thickness) and decreases its eﬀective dielectric constant (due to blocking an ion leakage30,31), i.e., increases the electrical capacitance of a monolayer and thus decreases Uc,E in eq 7. More importantly, denser packing decreases the electrical conductance along the surface, as described below.
Obviously only a portion of the bias applied to the pore drops across the monolayer near the contact line; the extent of that drop should correlate with the pore resistance in the closed state, Rs (see Figure 4). Equation 7 does not have an explicit dependence on Rs, but it implies that a low conductance along the surface and hence a smaller portion of the voltage drop across the monolayer at the contact line raises the critical voltage. Figure 5 demonstrates this correlation for nanopores modiﬁed with SiH16. Some nanopores are represented by connected multiple identical points obtained in

repeated cycles of electrowetting and drying. Such repeated cycling usually (but not always) results in deterioration of the quality of surface modiﬁcation, as is seen in Figure 5 by randomness of the lines connecting the identical symbols. The empty and ﬁlled symbols correspond to devices with a single and double silanization, respectively. The former usually demonstrate higher initial conductances and lower critical bias voltages.
It follows that electrical shorting in hydrophobic nanopores with the dimensions and surface modiﬁcation employed in this study can be explained as initiated through a combination of electrostatic pressure and electrowetting at the contact line. When the contact angle is decreased by electrowetting to a suﬃciently low value, which is still greater than 90°, electrostatic pressure becomes suﬃcient to pull water inside. At the later stage, when the distance between water menisci noticeably decreases, they can bend enough to overlap. Even though it appears as a very complex process, all mechanisms contribute at diﬀerent stages, including the menisci bending, without which the electrical shorting would be unable to recover the dry state at low bias, i.e., dewetting.
It is important to note that, similar to what was observed in long hydrophobic nanopores,13 dewetting of short hydrophobic pores can be favorable thermodynamically but not necessarily kinetically. The thermodynamic advantage of the dry state is very high in long nanopores but decreases with increasing the aspect ratio, D/H, to the extent of it diminishing at D/ H > 1, as is corroborated by lack of dewetting in pores with D ≈ 300 nm. A kinetic barrier for dewetting in nanopores with large H/D ratio is deﬁned by a large penalty ∼γD2 for forming a vapor bubble.17,18 For example, even for a very small diameter D ≈ 15 nm, this barrier exceeds 1500 kT and makes spontaneous dewetting practically impossible. Our short nanopores, when ﬁlled with water by prewetting with alcohol and its gradual change to water, also remain wet at low biases, but electrowetting can produce diﬀerent outcomes. If the shorting bias does not exceed the critical one signiﬁcantly, the conductance of such wetted pores upon returning to low biases is only a portion of what it is in a totally wetted state. This partially wetted state quickly recovers to a closed dry state. Applying a bias voltage much greater than the critical one can ﬁll up the nanopore with water completely and render it unrecoverable to the dry state. Of course, a physical removal of water and drying the pore recovers its original hydrophobic state.
So, why is there such a complex behavior with applied bias? The key is the interplay of the two mechanisms. If electrowetting decreases the contact angle well below 90°, the ﬂat menisci collapse without any bubble and thus prevent dewetting due to a large activation barrier. Smaller activation barriers can be

Figure 5. Correlation of the critical bias voltage with the pore resistance in the closed state, Rs. All pores were modiﬁed with hexadecylsilane (SiH16). Some pores are represented by multiple points obtained during repeated cycles of wetting and drying. The inset illustrates how the resistance in the closed state and the critical bias voltage, Uc, were identiﬁed from the IÀV curves on two representative examples.
realized when the menisci “slowly” move toward each other, with the contact angles greater than 90°, under the electrostatic pressure and eventually overlap (electrically short) with a belt-shaped bubble remaining as sketched in Figure 6. At the last stages before their contact, the menisci can further bend to electrospinning jets due to their slow moving contact lines. The existence of this bubble not only makes the ionic conductance smaller than for a fully ﬁlled pore but also precipitously reduces the activation barrier for easy dewetting.
The existence of that barrier is the cause of the hysteresis in IÀV curves, especially for the pores with large Uc, as in Figure 1B (see also Supporting Information). When the recovery of the closed state proceeds abruptly, it happens at the bias lower than is necessary for initial
shorting. The higher the bias used (beyond Uc) to partially open the pore, the closer the resistance to the totally
open pore and the longer it takes to recover the closed
state. In fact, it can take half an hour if the shorted state
has resistance almost equal to that of the totally opened
pore (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The same ﬁgure illustrates that the contrast in conductance between the on and oﬀ states is close to 3 orders of magnitude.
In nanopores with small Uc, where the barrier is small, transitions between the two states can be recognized by a large noise at biases in the vicinity of Uc, where the barrier is even lower (Figure 2B). The normalized current power spectral density, SI/I2, is the lowest for high biases, when the pore is totally opened (10 V in Figure 2C). At low frequencies, the noise appears to follow Hooge's relation, SI/I2 ≈ A/f,32 or white noise, with the value of the Hooge parameter, A ≈ 5 Â 10À7, similar to those observed in unmodiﬁed pores of the same electrolyte

concentrations.33 The noise near Uc (2.3 V in Figure 2B) formally also follows 1/f dependence but with 2 orders of magnitude larger A ≈ 5 Â 10À5. Moreover, the current has a distinct switching behavior between two states: with almost the same “low conductance” and more ﬂuctuating “high conductance” states.
This accentuates the unique properties of hydrophobic nanopores compared with other ion conductive devices with nonlinear currentÀvoltage characteristics. Hydrophobic nanopores have phase transitionlike behavior between the dry and wet states for which the conductance change reﬂects the change in water occupation inside the pore. Transitions between these states can be gated by applied bias, which interrupts not only the ionic current but exchange of water and other solutes.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on much smaller (D, H < 2 nm) hydrophobic nanopores22À24 revealed the intermittent character of the hydrophobic nanopore wetting by water under equilibrium conditions. The duration of these stochastic periods of dry and wet states appeared to increase with the pore diameter, the dielectric constant of the membrane, and the electric ﬁeld. These observations were qualitatively explained by a macroscopic description of competition between capillary and electrostatic contributions, in line with our conclusions. Because of the much smaller diameter and length, a comparatively minute activation barrier in the MD-modeled pores makes the time scale of stochastic pore wetting shorter, nanoseconds vs our seconds and minutes. For the same reason, there are no kinetically trapped wetted states in small pores and the wetting/dewetting phenomenon can be successfully analyzed based on thermodynamics. Yet, the expression for the critical bias of voltage-gated wetting, estimated using macroscopic thermodynamic considerations23 and appearing very similar to our eq 5, was also found to exceed the results of MD simulations. Among the proposed explanations it was suggested that water restructuring could signiﬁcantly

change the surface tension near the hydrophobic surface, since MD simulations demonstrated that the water driven into the pore exhibits strong electrostrictive behavior. We see a similar behavior in the pores that are larger by 2 orders of magnitude, where the surface tension between water and the hydrophobic surface appears to be altered by electric ﬁeld localized near the triple line because of nonzero surface conductance in a loosely packed self-assembled monolayer of hydrophobic molecules. Such an eﬀect is not included in MD simulations, but its importance in small voltage-gated pores can probably be veriﬁed by explicit molecular representation of the hydrophobic walls, which would allow water molecules to penetrate into the hydrophobic layer.
CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated that short hydrophobically modiﬁed individual nanopores can be employed as voltage-gated ionic channels, where applied bias induces transitions between low-conductance dry state and high-conductance wet state. The conductance change of almost 3 orders of magnitude reﬂects not only the change in water occupation inside the pore but the ability for other solutes to move through the pore. The mechanism of operation is explained by electrowetting-induced change of the critical contact angle that allows movement of the menisci contact lines toward each other under electrostatic pressure from the applied bias. Transitions to the open wet state are irreversible for large-diameter pores but can be reversible for pores with diameters smaller than their length. The switching bias voltage, Uc, increases with the pore resistance in the closed state and with the surface hydrophobicity measured as a water contact angle on the corresponding ﬂat surface. The reversibility depends upon the magnitude of the applied bias voltage, V, relative to Uc: For V g Uc, transitions are typically reversible, but if V is too large, V . Uc, a drop in the critical contact angle below 90° leaves no

bubble in the wetted state and prevents the pore from spontaneously drying when the bias is decreased. Nanopores with large Uc show more pronounced hysteresis in IÀV curves because of lower rates of induced wetting and drying. Hysteresis is less pronounced in nanopores with small Uc, but the two

states can still be recognized in enhanced current ﬂuctuations near Uc. These hydrophobic nanopores resemble voltage-gated biological channels despite being 2 orders of magnitude larger in size. It makes them good candidates for applications requiring eﬃcient gating.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Silicon nitride membranes were prepared by standard cleanroom processes as described previously.34 In brief, 50 Â 50 μm windows were deﬁned by optical lithography on a 300 nm think LPCVD SiN Æ100æ Si wafer with subsequent anisotropic KOH etching. Pore milling by focused ion beam was performed using an FEI dual-beam FIB instrument (10 pA, 30 kV ion current) with diameters from 60 to 600 nm (see Supporting Information).
Single-step silanization was done overnight from 2.5% solution of trimethoxyhexadecylsilane (SiH16) in toluene with subsequent washing in pure toluene and baking at 120 °C for 1 h. Before the second modiﬁcation, the membranes were wetted by ethanol and immersed in DI water for 30 min to hydrolyze unreacted methoxy groups and dried. A similar procedure was used for modiﬁcation by the ﬂuorosilane (heptadecaﬂuoro1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl)trimethoxysilane (SiH2F8) with a 2.5% solution in toluene performed for 1 h with subsequent rinsing and baking.
The modiﬁcation quality by silanes is sensitive to surface pretreatment, as it requires silanol groups that are very minimally present in native SiN. Pirahna treatment for 30 min was shown to be insuﬃcient. The resulting surface hydrophobicity is signiﬁcantly improved after 5 min oxygen plasma pretreatment (100 W) but exhibits a signiﬁcant variability as measured by the contact angle with water on the ﬂat portion of SiN ﬁlm. The contact angles of such prepared surfaces were typically 95À100° (Supporting Information) but were further improved by repeating the modiﬁcation step, which brought the contact angle close to 105°.
All measurements were performed in a custom-made electrochemical cell made from PDMS using degassed solutions of 1 M KCl in Tris buﬀer of pH 8 with Ag/AgCl electrodes placed within 5 mm on each side of the mounted membrane. The capacitance of the electrodes was maintained large enough to prevent any signiﬁcant discharging during the course of an experiment even with an open pore with a large steady bias, which was veriﬁed by linear IÀV curves before and after the experiment. The cell was degassed (MaximaDry oil-free pump, Fisher) and then ﬁlled with the degassed electrolyte solution similar to the procedure described earlier.13 The cell was equipped with windows allowing evaluation of the assembly under an optical microscope to ensure the absence of bubbles on the membrane surface, which were the major inconvenience for such hydrophobic membranes. A Keithley 6487 picoammeter was used to acquire all currentÀvoltage data.
For the sake of simplicity, the value for a closed pore resistance (Rs) was deﬁned as that at 0.5 V, and the critical bias voltage (Uc) as the voltage at which the current exceeds 5 nA. More than 40 devices were fabricated and tested. Some of them were prepared either with large diameters, which immediately became wet upon exposure to electrolyte, or modiﬁed with highly hydrophobic ﬂuorosilane, which prevents electrolyte intrusion at biases < 20 V. The total number of devices that exhibited reversible switching between zero and ﬁnite conductance was 16.
