Abstract

The free energy difference between a model system and some reference system can easily be written as an ensemble average, but the conventional Monte Carlo methods of obtaining such averages are inadequate for the free-energy case. That is because the Boltzmann-weighted sampling distribution ordinarily used is extremely inefficient for the purpose. This paper describes the use of arbitrary sampling distributions chosen to facilitate such estimates. The methods have been tested successfully on the Lennard-Jones system over a wide range of temperature and density, including the gas-liquid coexistence region, and are found to be extremely powerful and economical.

    Superhydrophilicity of α-alumina surfaces results from tight binding of interfacial waters to specific aluminols
    2022, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science
    Show abstract

    Contact angles at the alumina (0001) and ( ) surfaces are studied using both classical molecular dynamics simulations and experiments. To test the superhydrophilicity, the free energy cost of removing waters near the interfaces are calculated using the density fluctuations method. The strength of hydrogen bonds is determined by their lifetime and geometry.
    Mechanisms of CdTe(100) sublimation
    2022, Surface Science
    Show abstract

    The results of accelerated molecular dynamics and energetics calculations of the binding energies, barriers, and prefactors for various stages of desorption from the Cd-terminated and (2 1) Te-terminated surfaces of CdTe(100) are presented. Our results indicate that while the desorption barriers for Te on the Cd-terminated (100) surface are quite large, the corresponding prefactors are also extremely large. As a result, Cd desorption is the rate-limiting step for the case of sublimation via vacancy pit nucleation and growth, while the corresponding desorption barriers are in good agreement with the effective activation energy obtained in experiments for . A detailed analysis which takes into account our results for the Cd and Te desorption rates also leads to good quantitative agreement with the experimentally determined sublimation rate over this temperature range. In contrast, our results indicate that for the desorption of isolated Cd atoms on the ( ) Te-terminated surface may play an important role. The corresponding desorption barrier ( eV) is close to that found experimentally over this temperature range.
