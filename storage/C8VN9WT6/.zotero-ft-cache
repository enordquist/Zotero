Abstract: The molecular chaperone 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is driven by ATP hydrolysis and ADP–ATP exchange. ADP dissociation from Hsp70 is reportedly slow in the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi). In this study, we investigated the interaction of Hsp70 and its nucleotidebinding domain (NBD) with ADP in detail, by isothermal titration calorimetry measurements and found that Mg21 ion dramatically elevates the affinity of Hsp70 for ADP. On the other hand, Pi increased the affinity in the presence of Mg21 ion, but not in its absence. Thus, Pi enhances the effect of the Mg21 ion on the ADP binding. Next, we determined the crystal structures of the ADPbound NBD with and without Mg21 ion. As compared with the Mg21 ion-free structure, the ADPand Mg21 ion-bound NBD contains one Mg21 ion, which is coordinated with the b-phosphate group of ADP and associates with Asp10, Glu175, and Asp199, through four water molecules. The Mg21 ion is also coordinated with one Pi molecule, which interacts with Lys71, Glu175, and Thr204. In fact, the mutations of Asp10 and Asp199 reduced the affinity of the NBD for ADP, in both the presence and the absence of Pi. Therefore, the Mg21 ion-mediated network, including the Pi and water molecules, increases the affinity of Hsp70 for ADP, and thus the dissociation of ADP is slow. In ADP–ATP exchange, the slow ADP dissociation might be rate-limiting. However, the nucleotideexchange factors actually enhance ADP release by disrupting the Mg21 ion-mediated network.

Introduction The 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family members are conserved in almost all organisms and are involved in many cellular processes, including the correct folding of nascent and/or denatured proteins to prevent their aggregation and the post-translational transport of proteins.1–4 Hsp70 has an ATPdependent chaperone activity and contains the Nterminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and the C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD). The NBD consists of four subdomains, IA, IB, IIA, and IIB, which surround the ATP/ADP-binding pocket. The SBD is composed of the N-terminal b-sheet subdomain (SBDb), which binds the substrate polypeptide, and the C-terminal a-helical subdomain, which provides the lid of the SBDb.

resonance energy transfer measurements7 revealed that the overall conformation of Hsp70 changes upon ATP binding. This conformational change is likely to open the a-helical lid of the SBD, as observed in the ATP-bound Sse1 structure.8 In this state, the substrate-binding pocket in the SBD is uncovered, and the affinity of Hsp70 for its substrate proteins is consequently low. Next, a J domain cochaperone, such as DnaJ and Hsp40, binds to the NBD to activate ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70 through its J domain, and also recruits its substrate proteins to Hsp70.9,10 Upon ATP hydrolysis, the Hsp70 conformation changes from the ATP-bound state to the ADP-bound state, in which the substrate-binding pocket is covered by the a-helical lid, and the substrate protein is thereby held tightly.11,12 Subsequently, Hsp70 releases the ADP and catches a fresh ATP, and as a consequence, Hsp70 returns to the ATP-bound state and releases the refolded protein. In this manner, Hsp70 functions as a molecular chaperone through the ATP cycle.
In the ADP–ATP exchange reaction, Hsp70 releases ADP by itself, through the association of the SBD with the NBD.13 However, the dissociation rate of ADP is very slow, and the ADP-bound Hsp70 accumulates.14 In this step, the nucleotide-exchange factors, such as GrpE from prokaryotes and the BAG-family proteins, Hsp110, and HspBP1/Fes1/ Sls1 from eukaryotes, interact with the Hsp70 NBD and play important roles. In the crystal structures of the complexes of the NBD and the nucleotideexchange factors, the interactions of the nucleotideexchange factors modulate the arrangement of the four subdomains and thereby, disrupt the nucleotide-binding pocket of the NBD, which facilitates the ADP release. As a result, the nucleotide-exchange factors enhance the ADP–ATP exchange reaction of Hsp70.15–21 Actually, the presence of the nucleotideexchange factors improves the chaperone activity of Hsp70.17–20 Such nucleotide-exchange factors in the ATP cycle are needed, because of the slow dissociation rate of ADP from Hsp70. Furthermore, inorganic phosphate (Pi) lowers the ADP dissociation rate by several folds.22–26
In this study, the interaction of Hsp70 with ADP was analyzed biochemically and structurally. First, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements to investigate the affinities of Hsp70 and its NBD for ADP in detail, and found that ADP binds tightly to Hsp70 in a Mg2þ ion-dependent manner (Kd values are 81.5 and 66.3 nM for the Hsp70 and the NBD, respectively), and that Pi enhances the effect of the Mg2þ ion on the ADP binding (Kd values of 6.50 and 4.55 nM, respectively). Second, we compared the crystal structures of the ADP-bound Hsp70 NBDs with and without Mg2þ ion. In the ADP- and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD structure, the b-phosphate group of ADP is coordi-

nated with one Mg2þ ion, which interacts with the side chains of Asp10, Glu175, and Asp199 from Hsp70, through four water molecules. Furthermore, the Mg2þ ion was also coordinated with one Pi molecule, which interacted with Lys71, Glu175, and Thr204. None of these residues is involved in ADP binding in the absence of Mg2þ ion. Third, we confirmed that the replacements of Asp10 and Asp199 with alanine residues reduced the Mg2þ ion-dependent high affinities for ADP, in both the presence and the absence of Pi. Therefore, we concluded that the Mg2þ ion connects ADP to Asp10 and Asp199, and Pi stabilizes the Mg2þ ion binding, which results in the slow release of ADP from Hsp70.
Results
Mg21 ion increases the affinity of Hsp70 for ADP To understand the mechanism of the Pi-dependent reduction in the ADP release rate,22–26 we measured the dissociation constants of the Hsp70 NBD for ADP by ITC experiments. At first, the NBD protein and ADP were buffered with the Pi- and Mg2þ ioncontaining buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl and 20 mM phosphate-K buffers (pH 8.0), containing 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT], and the NBD protein solution was titrated with the ADP solution. As a result, we obtained the Kd value of 4.55 nM [Fig. 1(A)]. On the other hand, in the Pi-free and Mg2þ ion-containing buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT], the Kd value increased to 66.3 nM [Fig. 1(B)]. As described above, a previous study showed that the presence of Pi reduced the release rate of ADP from Hsp70,22 which is consistent with our results. Next, we performed ITC measurements in the Pi-containing and Mg2þ ion-free buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl and 20 mM phosphate-K buffers (pH 8.0), containing 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT] and the Pi- and Mg2þ ion-free buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT], and obtained the Kd values of 4.21 lM [Fig. 1(C)] and 4.61 lM [Fig. 1(D)], respectively. These results indicated that the Mg2þ ion removal reduces the affinity of the NBD for ADP more than the Pi removal, and that, in the absence of Mg2þ ion, the presence of Pi does not affect the ADP binding. Therefore, the Mg2þ ion increases the affinity of the Hsp70 NBD for ADP, and Pi enhances the effect of the Mg2þ ion.
The Mg2þ ion-dependent binding was also observed for the full-length Hsp70. In the Pi- and Mg2þ ion-containing buffer, the affinity of Hsp70 for ADP is remarkably high, with the Kd value of 6.50 nM [Fig. 1(E)]. In the Pi-free and Mg2þ ion-containing buffer, the affinity is reduced with the Kd value

of 81.5 nM [Fig. 1(F)]. The removal of the Mg2þ ion reduces the affinity dramatically, and the Kd values in the Pi-containing and Mg2þ ion-free buffer and the Pi- and Mg2þ ion-free buffer were 6.54 lM [Fig. 1(G)] and 9.92 lM [Fig. 1(H)], respectively. Therefore, we concluded that Mg2þ ion increases the affinity of Hsp70 for ADP and that Pi promotes the effect of the Mg2þ ion. Note that the presence of both Pi and Mg2þ ion is physiological.
Crystal structures of the ADP-bound NBD To determine how the Mg2þ ion increased the affinity of Hsp70 for ADP, we compared the crystal structures of the ADP-bound Hsp70 NBDs with and without the Mg2þ ion. At first, we expressed the Hsp70 NBD protein in Escherichia coli cells and purified it by column chromatography. To obtain the crystal of the ADP- and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD, ADP, MgCl2, and phosphate-K buffer (pH 8.0) were added to the purified NBD sample, to final concentrations of 5 mM, 5 mM, and 20 mM, respectively. After cocrystallization, we collected the 1.75 A˚ data set of the

ADP- and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD at a wavelength of 1.54 A˚ . In addition, for the crystallization of the ADP-bound and Mg2þ ion-free NBD, ADP and EDTA
were added to the NBD sample to 5 mM final con-
centrations. After cocrystallization, we collected the 1.58 A˚ data set at a wavelength of 1 A˚ and the 1.95 A˚ data set at a wavelength of 1.54 A˚ . Both of
the initial phases were determined by the molecular replacement method with the program MOLREP,27
and the models were refined. Crystallographic
data collection and refinement statistics are sum-
marized in Table I. The overall refined structures
of the ADP-bound NBD in the presence and absence of Mg2þ ion are presented in Figure 2(A,B),
respectively.
We confirmed that both of the NBD structures
contained the electron density of one ADP molecule and one Kþ ion [Fig. 2(C,D)]. The Kþ ions were con-
firmed by calculating the anomalous difference Fourier map [Fig. 2(E,F)]. In addition, ClÀ and Ca2þ
ions were observed, but they were not located in the
nucleotide-binding pocket. Moreover, we found the

electron densities of one Mg2þ ion and one Pi molecule in the nucleotide-binding pocket of the ADPand Mg2þ ion-bound NBD [Fig. 2(C)]. The overall structures of the ADP-bound NBDs with and without Mg2þ ion were quite similar, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.37 A˚ . Therefore, the absence of Mg2þ ion and Pi does not affect the overall structure of the NBD.
Nucleotide-binding pocket of the ADP-bound NBD Next, we compared the nucleotide-binding pockets in the ADP-bound NBD structures with and without Mg2þ ion. The nucleotide-binding pocket is surrounded by the four subdomains, IA (residues 1–39, 116–188, and 361–384), IB (residues 40–115), IIA (residues 189–228 and 307–360), and IIB (residues 229–306) of the Hsp70 NBD [Fig. 2(A,B)]. In both of the present structures, the ADP molecule is bound in the pocket, interacting with subdomains IA, IIA, and IIB. The adenosine moiety interacts with the side chains of Glu268, Lys271, and Ser275 from subdomain IIB. The a-phosphate group interacts with the main-chain amide group of Gly339 from subdomain IIA, and the b-phosphate group is associated with the main and side chains of Thr13 and Thr14

and main-chain of Tyr15. Consequently, the modes of the direct interactions between the NBD protein and the ADP molecule in the ADP-bound states with and without Mg2þ ion are almost the same [Fig. 3(A,B)].
Additionally, the ADP- and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD interacts indirectly with ADP, through one Mg2þ ion. The Mg2þ ion forms a coordinate bond with the b-phosphate group of ADP. Furthermore, the Mg2þ ion is coordinated with one Pi molecule and four water molecules [Fig. 3(C)]. Two of the water molecule hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Asp10, another water molecule hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Asp199 (subdomain IIA), and the other water molecule hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Glu175 (subdomain IA) and Asp199 [Fig. 3(C)]. These interactions are not observed in the ADP-bound NBD without Mg2þ ion. The interactions of the b-phosphate group of ADP with Asp10, Glu175, and Asp199, through the Mg2þ ion and the four water molecules are likely to form the basis of the higher affinity of Hsp70 for ADP than in the absence of Mg2þ ion. Moreover, the Pi molecule, which is coordinated with the Mg2þ ion, interacts with the side chains of Lys71 (subdomain IB), Glu175 (subdomain IA), and Thr204 (subdomain IIA). Therefore, it

is indicated that the promoting effect of Pi is due to the fixation of the Mg2þ ion in the site.
One Kþ ion, which was derived from the purifi-
cation buffer, is coordinated with the b-phosphate
group of ADP and is also directly coordinated with
the side chain of Asp10 (subdomain IA) and the
main chain of Tyr15 [subdomain IA; Fig. 3(C)]. On the other hand, in the ADP-bound and Mg2þ ion-free NBD, one Kþ ion, which was provided by the crys-
tallization solution, is directly coordinated with the
a–b bridging oxygen atom of ADP, the side chain of
Asp10, and the main chain of Tyr15 [Fig. 3(D)]. Although the Kþ ions associate with the NBD and ADP independently of the Mg2þ ion, the Mg2þ ion
shifts the orientation of the b-phosphate group of ADP, so that the Kþ ion is directly coordinated with

the b-phosphate group in the ADP- and Mg2þ ionbound NBD [Fig. 3(C)].
The effects of K1 and Na1 ions on ADP binding In the cytosol, Hsp70 requires a Kþ ion, rather than a Naþ ion, for its ATP hydrolysis and refolding activities.28,29 The major reason may be that the Kþ ion is larger than the Naþ ion, and thus, appropriately shifts the orientation of the triphosphate group of ATP, to facilitate ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70. However, it has also been reported that the Kd value of bovine Hsc70 for ADP in the presence of Naþ ion is the same as that in the presence of Kþ ion.28 In this context, we examined the effects of Kþ and Naþ ions on the ADP binding.

First, we performed ITC experiments to measure the affinity of the NBD for ADP in 20 mM Tris–HCl and 20 mM phosphate–Na buffers (pH 8.0), containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT and obtained the Kd value of 5.00 nM [Fig. 4(A)], which is nearly equal to the Kd value of 4.55

nM for the NBD in the KCl-containing buffer [Fig.

data set was collected, and the initial phase was

mutants of the NBD, and performed ITC experiments to measure their affinity for ADP in the absence and presence of Pi (Fig. 4). First, in the Pi-free and Mg2þ ion-containing ITC buffer, the D10A and D199A mutations reduced the binding affinity for ADP by about 5- and 12-fold, respectively, as compared with the wild-type NBD under the same conditions; the Kd value of the D10A mutant was 294 nM [Fig. 5(A)] and that of the D199A mutant was 722 nM [Fig. 5(B)]. Consequently, these two residues are essential for the high affinity for ADP in the absence of Pi. Furthermore, in the Pi- and Mg2þ ioncontaining ITC buffer, the mutations still reduced the binding affinity for ADP by about 10- and 30fold, respectively, as compared with the wild type; the Kd value of the D10A mutant was 49.8 nM [Fig. 5(C)] and that of the D199A mutant was 144 nM [Fig. 5(D)]. These results confirmed that both Asp10 and Asp199 contribute to the high affinity for ADP, even in the presence of Pi. Therefore, the entire network of interactions shown in Figure 3(C) is required for the high affinity for ADP, with the nMlevel dissociation constant.

bound NBD structures in the presence of Kþ ions. The overall structure, shown in Figure 4(B), is quite similar to the ADP- and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD containing Kþ ion, with an RMSD of 0.39 A˚ , and the direct interaction between the NBD and ADP [Fig. 4(C)] is the same as that in the presence of Kþ ion. Furthermore, the Naþ ion, which is derived from the purification buffer, is coordinated with Tyr15, Asp10, and the b-phosphate group of ADP and is located in the same position as the Kþ ion, so the indirect interaction is also the same. Therefore, although the Kþ ion is indispensable for the ATP hydrolysis and refolding activities of Hsp70, the Kþ ion can be replaced with the Naþ ion, with respect to ADP binding.
The replacement of Asp10 or Asp199 in Hsp70 reduces the affinity for ADP To examine the contributions of Asp10 and Asp199, which interact with the Mg2þ ion but lack interactions with Pi, we prepared the D10A and D199A

Discussion
The rate of ADP dissociation from Hsp70 is reportedly slow, and is further reduced by Pi.22–26 In this study, to investigate the ADP binding to Hsp70 in
detail, we performed ITC measurements under various buffer conditions, and found that Mg2þ ion
greatly increases the affinity of Hsp70 for ADP.
Although the overall structures of the ADP-bound NBD with and without Mg2þ ion are almost the same, the ADP and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD contains one Mg2þ ion, which are coordinated with the bphosphate group of ADP. The Mg2þ ion is also coor-
dinated with Pi and four water molecules, which hydrogen bond with the side chains of Asp10,
Glu175, and Asp199. Actually, in the absence of Pi and the presence of Mg2þ ion, the affinities of the
D10A and the D199A mutants for ADP are about 5-
and 12-fold lower than that of the wild type, respectively. Therefore, the Mg2þ ion is required for the
high affinity for ADP. In the presence of Mg2þ ion, Pi increases the af-
finity of the NBD and the full-length Hsp70 for ADP
by about 12-fold, which is consistent with the previous reports.26 In the ADP- and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD structure, Pi interacts with the Mg2þ ion and the side-chains of Lys71, Glu175, and Thr204. Through these interactions, the Pi fixes the Mg2þ ion, thus enhancing the effect of the Mg2þ ion on the ADP binding. Furthermore, in the presence of Mg2þ
ion, the addition of Pi increases the affinities of the D10A and D199A mutants for ADP, whereas the
addition of Pi does not increase the affinity of the wild type in the absence of Mg2þ ion. These results
suggest that the Asp10 and Asp199 residues from

Sequences are the NBDs of human (Homo sapiens) Hsp70 (NCBI Gene ID: 3303), Hsc70 (NCBI Gene ID: 3312), Bip/Grp78 (NCBI Gene ID: 3309), Grp75/mtHsp70 (NCBI Gene ID: 3313), and E. coli DnaK (NCBI Gene ID: 944750). Above the sequences, the secondary structures of human Hsp70 NBD are indicated. The residues involved in the Mg2þ ion-mediated network are indicated by green arrows.

Hsp70 and the Pi cooperatively work to fasten the Mg2þ ion. Consequently, the Mg2þ ion-mediated network, including the Pi and water molecules and the Asp residues, is important for the high affinity of Hsp70 for ADP. Furthermore, not only Asp10 and Asp199 but also Lys71, Glu175, and Thr204, which interact with Pi, are conserved among the Hsp70family proteins, including the other human Hsp70 isoforms and DnaK from E. coli (Fig. 6). Therefore, the high ADP affinity due to the Mg2þ ion-mediated network is likely to be a common feature of the Hsp70-family proteins.

The crystal structure of the ATP-bound Hsc70
NBD in the pre-ATP hydrolysis state has been reported.30 In this state, the b- and c-phosphate groups of ATP interact with one Mg2þ ion, and the

Lys71 is poised to attack the c-phosphate group of ATP.31 The Mg2þ ion and the residues that are involved in the Mg2þ ion-mediated network are
located in the same positions as those in the ADPand Mg2þ ion-bound NBD structure. Moreover, the mutations of the residues involved in the Mg2þ ion-
mediated network reportedly impaired the ATP

hydrolysis activity and the ATP-dependent conformational change of Hsp70,32,33 and these residues are also essential for its chaperone activity. Thus, the formation of the Mg2þ ion-mediated network in the ADP-bound NBD results unavoidably from the ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70. For the ADP–ATP exchange reaction of Hsp70, the high ADP affinity due to the Mg2þ-mediated network might be an obstacle. However, nucleotide-exchange factors are present in all organisms, and they facilitate the ADP–ATP exchange reaction. The reported structures of Hsp70 (fragment) in complex with exchange factors, such as GrpE, BAG proteins, HspBP1, and Hsp110, indicate that the exchange factors disrupt the Mg2þ ion-mediated network of the ADP-bound NBD. Therefore, Hsp70 can efficiently function as a molecular chaperone.
Materials and Methods
Protein expression The construction of the expression plasmids for the NBD (residues 1–388) and the full-length of human Hsp70, as N-terminal fusions with a His-tag and a TEV protease cleavage site, was described previously.18 The mutations were introduced by QuickChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis and were verified by DNA sequencing. The wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta2 (DE3) cells induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-Dgalactopyranoside.
ITC measurement For ITC measurements, protein samples were prepared as described previously.18 Briefly, the wild type and mutants of the NBD and full-length Hsp70 proteins were expressed in E. coli cells and purified with a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). After cleavage of the His-tag by TEV protease, the proteins were purified by chromatography on a HisTrap column, a HiTrap Blue column (GE Healthcare), a

Mono Q column (GE Healthcare), and a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). The NBD and fulllength Hsp70 samples purified by this method are in the nucleotide-free state, as confirmed by HPLC.34 ITC measurements were performed at 25C with a Microcal VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, Northhampton, MA). For each injection, a 5 lL portion of the ADP solution in the syringe was injected into the protein solution in the cell, at 240-s intervals. The data were processed with the MicroCal Origin software, version 7.0. Each measurement was repeated three times, and the averages and the standard deviations were evaluated. All results are summarized in Table II.
Purification and crystallization of the Hsp70 NBD The cells were suspended in 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole, and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and then loaded on a HisTrap column, which was eluted with an imidazole gradient. Next, His-tagged TEV protease was added to the protein solution, and the sample was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 300 mM NaCl. The tag-cleaved NBD sample was loaded on the HisTrap column again, to remove the TEV protease and the cleaved His-tag. Subsequently, the NBD sample was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris– HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA, overnight at 4C and then, dialyzed against 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA. The NBD sample was then purified by chromatography on a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare). Finally, the NBD sample was loaded on a Superdex 200 column, which was eluted with 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT. Additionally, for the crystallization of the ADP- and Mg2þ ionbound NBD containing Kþ ion, the sample buffer was exchanged to Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0),

The NBD sample was concentrated to about
10 mg/mL. To obtain the crystal of the ADP- and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD containing Kþ ion (Crystal
1), the protein sample was mixed with ADP,
MgCl2, and phosphate-K buffer (pH 8.0) at final concentrations of 5 mM, 5 mM, and 20 mM,
respectively and crystallized by the sitting-drop
vapor-diffusion method at 293 K, against the reser-
voir solution [0.1 M Bis–Tris buffer (pH 5.5), con-
taining 0.05 M CaCl2 and 30 % polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 500]. The crystal belonged to
the space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a ¼ 45.73 A˚ , b ¼ 61.34 A˚ , c ¼ 142.65 A˚ , a ¼ b ¼ c ¼ 90.00. To obtain the crystal of the ADP-bound and Mg2þ-free NBD (Crystal 2), the protein sample
was mixed with ADP and EDTA to final concen-
trations of 5 mM, and crystallized by the same
method, against the reservoir solution [0.1 M Bis–
Tris buffer (pH 5.5), containing 0.25 M KNO3 and 25% polyethylene glycol 3350]. The crystal
belonged to the space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a ¼ 45.86 A˚ , b ¼ 63.14 A˚ , c ¼ 144.22 A˚ , a ¼ b ¼ c ¼ 90.00. To obtain the crystal of the ADP- and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD containing Naþ ion (Crystal 3), the protein sample was mixed
with ADP and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 5 mM and crystallized by the same method, against
the reservoir solution [0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH
7.0), containing 0.15 M MgCl2 and 30% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 500]. The crystal
belonged to the space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a ¼ 46.11 A˚ , b ¼ 63.68 A˚ , c ¼ 143.53 A˚ , a ¼ b ¼ c ¼ 90.00.

Data collection and structure determination Crystal 1 was directly flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were measured at the BL-17A beamline of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) at

a wavelength of 1.54 A˚ . Crystal 2 was cryoprotected with 15% glycerol in the reservoir solution and was flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were collected at the BL26B2 beamline of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) at wavelengths of 1.00 and 1.54 A˚ . Crystal 3 was cryoprotected with 15% glycerol in the reservoir solution and was flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were collected at the BL26B2 beamline of SPring-8 at a wavelength of 1.00 A˚ . All X-ray diffraction data were processed using the HKL2000 program.35 The initial phases were determined by the molecular replacement method with the program MOLREP,27 using the structure of the human Hsp70 NBD in the AMPPNP-bound state (PDB ID: 2E8A)34 as the search model. Next, we used the CNS programs36 and the Refmac5 program37 to refine the structures, and modified the protein models with the TURBOFRODO program (http://www.afmb.univ-mrs.fr/TURBO-) and the Coot program.38 The ADP, Pi, and PEG molecules and the Mg2þ, Naþ, Kþ, ClÀ, and Ca2þ ions were added into the electron densities, which were visible in the Fo À Fc map. All of the numbers and distances of the coordinate bonds between the metal ions and the oxygen atoms are appropriate,39 and the anomalous signals of the Kþ, ClÀ, and Ca2þ ions were observed in the anomalous difference Fourier maps. Anomalous difference peaks in Crystals 1 and 2 are listed in Table III. Crystal 3 contained Pi, which was probably derived from the small amount of Pi in the ADP sample, as Pi was not added to the NBD sample for purification and crystallization. The final refined model of the ADPand Mg2þ ion-bound NBD containing Kþ ion achieved an R/Rfree of 18.9/21.3, that of the ADPbound and Mg2þ ion-free NBD achieved an R/Rfree of 18.6/20.8, and that of the ADP- and Mg2þ ion-bound NBD containing Naþ ion achieved an R/Rfree of 18.6/ 21.8. The final models had no Ramachandran violations, as confirmed by PROCHECK.40 The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes: 3AY9 for the structure of the ADP- and Mg2þ ionbound NBD containing Kþ ion, 3ATV for the structure of the ADP-bound and Mg2þ-free NBD, and 3ATU for the structure of the ADP- and Mg2þ ionbound NBD containing Naþ ion).
