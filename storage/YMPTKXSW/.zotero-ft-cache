NMR identification of hydrophobic cavities with
low water occupancies in protein structures using small gas molecules

Gottfried Otting1, Edvards Liepinsh1, BertiI Halle2 and Urban Frey3

Magnetization transfer through dipole-dipole interactions (nuclear Overhauser effects, NOEs) between water protons and the protons lining two small hydrophobic cavities in hen egg-white lysozyme demonstrates the presence of water molecules with occupancies of -10-50%. Similarly, NOEs were observed between the cavity protons and the protons of hydrogen, methane, ethylene or cyclopropane applied at 1-200 bar pressure. These gases can thus be used as general NMR indicators of empty or partially hydrated hydrophobic cavities in proteins. All gases reside in the cavities for longer than 1 ns in marked contrast to common belief that gas diffusion in proteins is not much slower than in water. Binding to otherwise empty cavities may be a major aspect of the anesthetic effect of small organic gas molecules.

Hydrophobic cavities in the interior of protein structures are codes 4LYM11, 1HEL12, 1LZT13, 2LZT14), under different pres-

The present study of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) in aqueous solution demonstrates that small hydrophobic cavities exist in wild-type HEWL which are partially filled with water.

Fig. 2 Water-protein cross-peaks in NOESY and ROESY spectra of HEWL and comparison with the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum in aqueous

One-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum. Selected water-protein NOE peaks are identified with the assignments of the protein signals involved (see text).

NOEs, NOESY and ROESY cross-peaks are also observed at the water signal when (i) protein protons exchange with the water or (ii) NOEs between non-exchangeable and exchangeable protein protons are relayed to the water signal by proton exchange with the water. Exchange peaks can be identified by their positive sign in ROESY experiments, while exchange-relayed NOEs always have the same sign as the direct NOEs. Thus, only the threedimensional structure can tell whether a water-protein crosspeak can arise from an exchange-relayed NOE or not28.
Detection of cavity water in HEWL 1D cross-sections taken through two-dimensional NOESY and ROESY spectra at the 1H frequency of the water signal are shown in Fig. 2. The most intense cross-prnks are from direct chemical exchange between water protons and exchangeable HEWL protons. These peaks are positive in the ROESY crosssection (Fig. 2a,b)27.
Several of the protons lining the hydrophobic cavities I and II ofHEWL give rise to weak positive NOESY cross-peaks with the water signal (Figs 2,3). Their intensities are approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the NOEs typically observed with classical hydration sites, where the buried water molecules are stabilized by several hydrogen bonds to polar groups of the protein (compare to the NOE with Ile 55 HN which is hydrogen bonded to the internal water molecule W18015; Fig. 2). Because of their weak intensities and the spectral overlap, not all NOEs

to the cavity protons could be identified. Thus, the NOE to Met 105 0:H3 is the only water-HEWL NOE which could be identified for cavity II. Yet, these NOEs seem to arise unambiguously from water in cavities I and II. They cannot be explained as NOEs with protein protons at the water chemical shift. The nearest exchangeable protein or water proton to Met 105 Q:H3
is at a distance of -6.8 A (Tyr 23 HT)). Similarly, the protons of
Leu 8 ColH3 and Leu 17 Co1H3 of cavity I are more than,
respectively, 6.5 and 5.5 A from any proton in rapid exchange
with the water. Equally intense intramolecular NOEs with the
same protons correspond to distances of at most 4.5 A. This
indicates that cavities I and II are populated by water, but the weak NOE intensities suggest only partial occupancy. In particular, the NOEs are not weakened by short residence times of the water molecules, since the ROESY cross-peaks are not much more intense than the NOESY cross-peaks. This holds also for mixing times much shorter than those used for the spectra of Fig. 2 (data not shown).
Detection of gas molecules in HEWL If they are mostly empty, hydrophobic cavities in the interior of a protein structure may be expected to bind small organic gas molecules better than water. Figs 4 and 5 show that for a variety of gases, intermolecular NOEs are indeed observed between the protons of the gas molecules and the protons lining cavities I and II in HEWL. As with water, only a single average signal was

HEWL, site C has the highest affinity for the natural substrate of HEWL and has been shown to bind a large variety of small organic solvent molecules9. Like organic solvents, cyclopropane and ethylene show intense NOEs with Trp 63 Hel, Trp 108 Hel and Ile 98 CoH3 (Fig. 4). In contrast, only weak

The NOESY cross-peak between water and Trp 108 Hel is positive (Fig. 2), but it is weaker than expected for a stable hydration shell with high occupancy. Since site C is filled with water molecules with >85% occupancy in the crystal structures of HEWL1 1- 20, the water-Trp 108 Hel NOE appears to be weakened by short water residence times of at most a few nanoseconds. Clearly, the unstable hydration of site C favours the binding of hydrophobic molecules like ethylene and cyclo-
propane.

Algorithm for the identification of cavity space. The cavity space in the crystal structure of HEWL was determined by a grid search algorithm. A three-dimensional grid was superimposed
onto the structure coordinates with 0.5 A grid point separation . Grid points, where spheres of 0.5 A radius could be accommodat-
ed without van der Waals violations with protein atoms, were

could also accommodate spheres of 1.4 A radius. If van der Waals violations were detected, the grid point was shifted by up to 0.5 A in all three dimensions in steps of 0.1 A to search for a location
without van der Waals violations. If no location without van der
Waals violations was found, the grid point was dropped from the
selection. If two grid points ended up within 0.1 A of one another,

The origin of the observed selectivity of gases and organic solvents for empty hydrophobic cavities can be explained by the energetic cost to replace a polar water molecule by a nonpolar gas molecule of similar size.

nance24-44• The water suppression in the NOESY spectra was improved by homospoil pulses during the mixing time. The use of a spin-lock pulse for water suppression resulted in an excitation profile along the F2 frequency axis described by sin(2irv't), where v is the offset from the carrier frequency in Hz. For improved readabili-
ty, the spectral region between 5 and 11 p.p.m. in Fig. 2 was inverted to compensate for the sign inversion caused by the excitation
profile. The spectra of Fig. 2 were recorded using t 1max=52 ms, t2max=118 ms, 50 ms mixing time, and recording times of 13 h.
Because of the extensive spectral overlap in the 1D NOESY and ROESY spectra, most of the cross-peaks were assigned from 2D NOE-NOESY. NOE-TOCSY. ROE-NOESY and ROE-TOCSY experiments, in which the water signal was selectively excited and the NOEs with

the protein protons were at least 4 A from any rapidly exchanging
proton of hydroxyl, amino, guanidinium and imidazol groups in the three-dimensional structure of HEWL.

180°(selective) pulse was a 10 ms RE-BURP pulse47 at the frequency of the 1H resonance of the dissolved gas. The spin-echo sequence effectively filters the signal of the small gas molecules by two effects: (i) only the magnetization refocused by the selective 180° pulse is also refocused by the second homospoil pulse magnetizat ion; (ii) the 1H magnetization of HEWL relaxes virtually completely during 200 ms of transverse relaxation. The spectra of Figs 4 and 5 were recorded with the following parameters: t 1max=100 ms, tzmax=223 ms, mixing time 100 ms in NOESY and 50 ms in ROESY experiments, total recording time=16 h per spectrum. The water signal was suppressed by selective pre-irradiation. No significant NOE enhancement was observed between the 1H NMR signals of the dissolved gases and the water. The intermolecular NOEs were assigned by comparison with conventional NOESY and TOCSY48 experiments recorded under the same conditions. The concentrations of the dissolved gases were determined by integration of their 1H NMR signal and comparison with the intensities of resolved
resonances of HEWL.

NOESY and ROESY spectra for the selective observation of intermolecular gas-HEWL NOEs were recorded by replacing the initial 90• pulse of the conventional pulse sequences by the sequence 90·-Hs-t.-1 so·(selective)-HS-t.9, where HS denote homospoil spoil pulses of 2 ms duration applied with a sine shaped amplitude. The delay t;. was set to 100 ms. The

Box 1 Effect of fast internal motion on intermolecular NOEs

The cross-relaxation rates responsible for cross-peaks in NOESY and ROESY spectra are governed by the spectral density, j(w), of the magnetic dipole coupling at multiples of the Larmer frequency Wo zs. For an isotropically tumbling protein (correlation
time 'tR) with a fast internal motion (correlation time -r1, with
't,<<'tR, 1/0>c,)49,50,

involving the solid spherical harmonics Fk9(R)=Ckq_tn)/Rk+l of rank k=2. Here R is the interproton vector, of length R and orientation 0.=(0,q>), the Ckq(O.) are (unnormalized) sperical harmonics, and (...) represents an average over the equilibrium distribution of R associated with the internal degree(s) of freedom . In the absence of internal motion (fixed R), A2=R·6.
The generalized order parameter is most conveniantly evalu ated in a coordinate system with origin at the centre of symmetry of the internal motion rather than at the proton. If only one
of the two coupled protons undergoes internal motion, the solid harmonics can be transformed to the centre of symmetry according to51

where R1=(R1,0. 1) and R2=(R2,n2) are vectors from the center of

symmetry to the mobile and fixed proton, respectively, and
R1<R2 is assumed. Further, Bkpq=(-1)P+q{(k- p)!(k+p)!/[(2-q)!(2+q)! (k-2-p+q)!(k-2+p-q)!)}1/2_
If the mobile-proton vector R1 is distributed with spherical symmetry, it follows from the orthogonality of the spherical har-
monics that (Ck-Z,q-p(0.1)) = lik21iqP' whereby (F2q(R)) = F2q(R2) . Inserting this into equation 2 and using the closure relation for spherical harmonics, we obtain A2=R2-6, that is, the same result as if the spherically disordered proton were fixed at the center of symmetry. For internal motion of lower symmetry, corrections to this result appear that are proportional to an internal order
parameter S;nt and a power of z=R 1IR2• As S;n1<<1 for an orientationally disorderd ligand molecule and R1/R2<1, these corrections are small. By employing a two-centre expansion for solid harmonics51, internal motions of both protons can be handled in a similar way. When both protons are spherically disordered, A 2 is the same as if they were located at the centres of symmetry.
To calculate the spectral density in equation 1, we also need the average (R·6). This is most conveniantly obtained from a Laplace-type expansion 52 of R·6. For a spherically disordered pro-
ton, we thus obtain (R·6)=R2·6(1+z2)/(1-z2)4. With R1=1 A and R2=3.5 A, as appropriate for methane in cavity I, the relative
weight of the second term in equation 1, that is (R-6)/A2-1, is
0.52. (Alternatively, if the order parameter is defined as S=Al(R· 6) 112, then 5=0.81) A simple calculation then shows that the sec-
ond term in equation 1, which depends on the rate of the internal motion, makes a negligible (<3% if 'tR=10 ns) contribution to the NOESY and ROESY cross-peak intensities at 600 MHz
as long as -r1<0.1 ns.
