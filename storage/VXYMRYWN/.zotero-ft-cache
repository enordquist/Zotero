The structural transformation of a framework aluminosilicate, Li-ABW, is studied using molecular dynamics. The calculations are carried out by applying the method presented by Martoňák et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 075503 (2003)], that allows for the exploration of the Gibbs free energy as a function of the cell parameters by history-dependent dynamics. We show that this technique allows for an extensive exploration of the phase
space also for complex polyatomic material, such as a zeolite, and allows for the successful prediction of a
reconstructive phase transition at the pressure and temperature of experimental relevance. In particular, we observe a reconstructive transition from anhydrous Li-ABW to eucryptite at the temperature of ϳ920 K, as experimentally observed. The steps initiating the transformation and the transition pathway are discussed.

Reconstructive transitions of complex crystal structures are difﬁcult to observe with a computational approach, since the energy barrier involved in the process is usually high, and therefore the time required to simulate the transition with a standard approach is prohibitively long. By applying our technique we are able to extensively explore the phase space of a framework aluminosilicate, the anhydrous Li-ABW zeolite, and to simulate a reconstructive phase transition.
Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials, with a structure formed by corner sharing SiO4 or AlO4 tetrahedra. Each tetrahedron is linked to other four to form framework materials which may have different topology. Zeolites are characterized by having cages or channels, where alkaline or earth-alkaline cations and small molecules (generally water) are located.1 The application ﬁelds of these minerals range from chemistry and physics, to oil reﬁning, waste water treatment, agriculture, and many others. They are also powerful speciﬁc catalysts and ionic exchangers.2 Very often the structural changes on zeolitic materials happen under hightemperature conditions once the water molecules have escaped from the channels. These phase transitions can be both displacive and reconstructive. In the case of displacive transition, the tetrahedra in ﬁrst approximation behave like rigid units and reorient without breaking the chemical bonds; the volume of the unit cell can vary considerably, and from the analysis of the T-O-T ͑T = Si, Al͒ angles, it is possible to recognize the global effect of the transition on the framework. If the temperature is high enough, a reconstructive transition can drive the crystal into a topologically new phase, where the connectivity between the tetrahedra changes and some bonds break and reform. Also in this case, the tetrahedral units, normally indicated as a primary structure of a zeolitic framework, are ﬁnally conserved, even if during the transition some of them are temporarily broken. The mechanism involved in reconstructive transitions is at present poorly understood and this paper is devoted to discussing such transitions from a microscopic point of view.

Synthetic zeolites with the ABW-type structure have a particularly versatile topology of the framework and of the extra-framework constituents.3–5 A lot of structural studies on these materials have been carried out, both experimentally6–9 and theoretically.10,11
In this work we focus on the Li-ABW zeolite, synthesized by Barrer and White in 1951.12 The Li-ABW formula is Li͓AlSiO4͔ · H2O, suggesting a perfect alternance of Si and Al atoms in the Al-O-Si bridges, namely each SiO4 tetrahedron is surrounded by four AlO4 units. The framework structure has an orthorhombic symmetry and is formed by directly
connected hexagonal rings sheets in the bc plane. Monodi-
mensional eight-member channels with a maximum-free diameter of 3.8 Å and a minimum-free diameter of 3.4 Å,5
develop along the c axis, where water molecules and Li cations are located. It has been experimentally observed13 that if
the temperature is raised in a dry environment, a displacive
transition occurs on the framework when dehydration starts,
leading to a structure known as anhydrous Li-ABW. No
symmetry changes occur during this transition: the space
group of the system remains the same, only the channel
shape becomes strongly elliptical, and at the same time, the
Li cations modify their coordination. Due to this framework
rearrangement, the pore size becomes too small to hold small
molecules inside the channels, except for the extra-
framework cations. If the system is heated at a temperature of ϳ920 K, a second reconstructive transition drives the crystal from the anhydrous Li-ABW to the ␥-eucryptite structure. The connectivity of the atoms is modiﬁed and the
ﬁnal structure has a monoclinic symmetry. This second pro-
cess is irreversible, while a long hydrothermal treatment can
convert the anhydrous Li-ABW to the hydrated Li-ABW
structure. The ﬁrst process, i.e., the displacive structural change upon dehydration, has already been studied14 with a Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics approach,15 while the
second transition is much more complicated, due to the
larger energies involved in a framework structural rearrange-
ment. In this paper we apply recently developed algorithms

that allow us to probe this second transition using classical

potentials. The results obtained with the classical potential

are afterwards reﬁned with ab initio calculations.

A standard method that allows for the simulation of phase transitions is the Parrinello-Rahman approach,16 in which the

cell parameters are treated as extra degrees of freedom of the

system, and are evolved with a suitable dynamics. Tempera-

ture and pressure are the parameters used to drive the system

into the new phase. Often it is necessary to signiﬁcantly in-

crease these parameters with respect to the values of experi-

mental interest; in fact, in a simulation in which periodic

boundary conditions are applied, nucleation or surface

effects are suppressed, and the barriers involved in a phase

transition are usually very large. For this reason, a Parrinello-

Rahman approach, in this speciﬁc case, is not able to de-

scribe the transition, because of the high stability of the

Al-O and Si-O bonds. In fact, to give to the system sufﬁcient

energy to break some bonds, it is necessary to increase the

temperature so much that only a collapse of the structure is

observed.

An innovative approach has been recently proposed by Martoňák et al.18 In this method the h matrix is used as a

collective variable, or order parameter, as in the standard

Parrinello-Rahman method, and in h space a history-

dependent potential is constructed as a function of time in order to compensate for the Gibbs free energy G͑h͒ and drive

the system towards the transition state. This approach is de-

scribed in detail in Refs. 17 and 18. The simulation of the anhydrous Li-ABW→ ␥-eucryptite

transition is carried out by employing a classical potential in the form proposed by Zirl and Garofalini,19 developed for

alumino-silicate interfaces. The same potential has also been used by Gordillo and Herrero20 to describe the properties of

feldspar, which is very similar in composition and structure

to zeolites. The potential is composed by a two-body modi-

for rij Ͻ ric and rik Ͻ ric, and Vijk = 0 elsewhere. The initial simulation cell has the dimensions of two anhydrous Li-ABW crystallographic cells,13 with the parameters of a = 9.938 Å, b = 6.569 Å, c = 9.896 Å, and ␣ = ␤ = ␥ = 90°; the number of atoms inside the supercell is 56 and the time step
used for molecular dynamics is 1 fs.
Before starting the metadynamics, three reconstructive
phases are analyzed in order to test the reliability of the
classical potential: the anhydrous Li-ABW, a eucryptite
structure, and a tridymite-like structure, with the latter being
a typical structure in which zeolites transform upon heating.
The properties of these three phases are computed with both classical and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) (see Table I). Starting from the classical optimized geometries, a simu-

lated annealing within the Parrinello-Rahman scheme is performed on the three phases. The electron-electron interactions are described by a gradient-corrected density-functional approximation, using the Becke functional21 for exchange interactions and the Perdew functional22 for correlation. The ion-electron interactions are described by norm-conserving pseudopotentials; d nonlocality is assumed for Si, Al, and O atoms, p nonlocality for Li atoms. The ab initio equation of state for the three phases were obtained by ﬁnite differences variations of the cell volume, followed by geometry optimizations. By doing a comparison between the ab initio and the classical results, a constant offset in the equilibrium volumes is observed. The Parrinello-Rahman optimization on the three phases results in cell volume contraction (about 10%) with respect to the classical one. Since the minimum of the equations of state calculated according to the classical potential does not match the ab initio ones, the correction term PV, with a pressure of 60 kbar, is added to the classical potential in order to reach the best agreement between the equilibrium volumes. With this correction the classical and ab initio volumes are very close, with errors in the lattice constants below 1%, of the order of the typical DFT error. The energy differences obtained for the three phases with ab initio and classical calculations are not equally ordered, but they are very small and lower than a factor of kBT per atom. These small errors are not expected to alter signiﬁcantly the transition pathway between the various phases.
Following Ref. 18 in the metadynamics approach it is necessary to evaluate the expectation value of the derivative of the Gibbs free energy at constant h,

ume changes mostly by rigid rotations of the tetrahedra that preserve the network topology.
After having explored those values of h for which a displacive rearrangement of the tetrahedra is possible, the system is pushed by the metadynamics towards a reconstructive transition. This takes place at the metastep 67, after the equivalent of 0.5 ns of standard simulation time. The transition path is remarkably simple and is pictured in Fig. 1. It involves only processes of bond switch between the Al-O bonds, and it would be hard to imagine a lower energy path for such a complex transformation. The Al-O bond is weaker than the Si-O bond as, for instance, reﬂected by the larger bond distance (1.75 Å for Al-O and 1.62 Å for Si-O). Hence, the reconstructive transition induces the breaking and reforming of some Al-O bonds. In particular, half of the Al atoms, namely the four that sit on two neighboring ͕1 , 0 , 0͖ planes, move in a concerted way, leading within 0.3 ps to four bond switch, one for each tetrahedron (see Fig. 2), such

The parameters deﬁning this Gaussian are W = 5000 K and ␦h = 0.4 Å (see Ref. 18). During the ﬁrst 67 steps of metadynamics the deformation of the simulation cell does not lead
to bond breaking, but only to displacive rearrangement of the
framework, and the volume ﬂuctuates up to 15% from the
original value. The AlO4 and the SiO4 units are, instead, almost invariant and the system can accommodate the vol-

that the Li-ABW tetrahedral units are broken, forming the structure in Fig. 1(b). After 6.4– 8.4 ps, a second bond switch is then observed for each of these Al, leading to the formation of new tetrahedral units with the topology of the eucryptite [Fig. 1(c)].
The distances between one of these Al and the four O involved in the switching are pictured in Fig. 2, showing that the Al remains tetracoordinated during all the simulation time. The bond switch events are accompanied by the con-
certed rotation of all the framework tetrahedra not directly
involved in the transition. The Al and Si atoms at the center
of these tilting tetrahedra move very little from their starting
crystallographic position. On the contrary, the Al atoms in-
volved in the bond breaking move signiﬁcantly, exploring three minima (see Fig. 3), the initial and the ﬁnal corresponding to anhydrous Li-ABW and eucryptite, and the intermediate corresponding to the state in Fig. 1(b). The Li atoms also participate in the transformation and their dis-
placement at high temperature is similar to what is seen in
the ab initio simulation reported in Ref. 14. In particular, at
the moment of the bond breaking, Li cations are located at
the position labeled in Ref. 14 as Li’, indicating that the
displacement from their original crystallographic position
upon heating is one of the factors that promote the transition. The general rule of chemical reaction kinetics23 says that a bond is broken only after it has been activated (weakened) by the presence of an incoming third partner, thus forcing
the transition state. This rule indeed explains the fact that the
activation energy for a chemical reaction involving the
breaking of a bond is always much lower than the binding
energy of that bond. In our metadynamics simulation
the found phase-transition path follows such a rule, and the
Al-O bonds are broken only after they are weakened by the
displacement of the Li cations. The transition pathway ob-
served with metadynamics is in good agreement with the

experimental observations reported in Ref. 13. In that paper the same tetrahedral units involved in the bond switching are thought to be responsible for the structural transformation, leading to a displacement of the Al atoms very similar to the one proposed in our work. Obviously, a direct observation of the bond breaking and reforming is not possible with a diffraction analysis, but the suggestions given by the author on the possible transition pathway make us conﬁdent of our results.
With the innovative method adopted, a reaction not accessible with other computational approaches has been studied, and the mechanism has been discussed. This was achieved by a simulation whose length is comparable with a classical MD simulation, while a fully ab initio approach is still challenging. At least for this system, the errors induced by the classical potential are rather small anyway, and the transition path between the two phases that we described should not be signiﬁcantly affected by these errors. It should be remarked that the great advantage of using the metadynamics is that it generates a large number of realistic polymorphs without any initial guess. In metadynamics runs performed at other pressures and temperatures, we observed several reconstructive transitions to phases that are topologically different both from anhydrous Li-ABW and eucryptite (e.g., structures with the topology of tridymite, of a BCT Zeolite (see Ref. 5), or lamellar phases in which the tetrahedral network forms planes that are bond together by the counterions). Such an extensive search of structures was performed at a small computational price, since the system is described by a classical potential. If the goal would be the determination of the phase diagram of a novel material, metadynamics, employing a cheap potential (e.g., classical or semiempirical), could be exploited for suggesting the relevant structures, and ab initio calculations could be performed on these structures in order to determine more accurately the free energy ordering.
