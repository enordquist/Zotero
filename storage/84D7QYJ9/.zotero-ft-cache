Abstract
The behavior of water conﬁned on nanometer length scales is important in a diverse set of technical and scientiﬁc contexts, ranging from the performance of fuel cells and biological molecular machines to the design of self-assembling nanoscale materials. Here, we review recent insights into the structure and thermodynamics of conﬁned water that have been elucidated primarily by computer simulation studies. We emphasize investigations in which interfacial chemistry and molecular topography are varied systematically and in which a wide range of thermodynamic conditions of temperature and pressure are explored. We consider homogeneous interfaces ranging from the simplest hard wall to chemically realistic, but structurally ideal, hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, and the continuous scale of surface polarity is investigated. Features associated with interface heterogeneities arising from chemical patterning or from the natural characteristics of protein surfaces are discussed. Finally, we provide our thoughts on important directions for further studies.

1. INTRODUCTION
The fact that the structure and properties of a liquid can be substantially perturbed in the vicinity of an interface with a solid, vapor, or other liquid has long been appreciated (1). The properties that are inﬂuenced by the heterogeneity of the environment include both structural (and correspondingly, thermodynamic) ones as well as transport properties. The impact on ﬂuid behavior has been explored in a broad range of liquids and diverse contexts, including metals (2), liquid crystals (3), polymer solutions (4), and of course, water (5–7). The increasing capacity of computer simulation (6, 8, 9) and advanced spectroscopies and microscopies (2, 5, 7, 10–12) continues to open new vistas and an ever-expanding access to molecular-scale details.
In the present review, we focus on the role of spatial conﬁnement. When a liquid sample is macroscopic, so that any surface conﬁning the system creates an interface independent of any others, the interfacial properties are distinct from the bulk, and at a macroscopic distance from the interface, one reaches the bulk liquid. When conﬁnement sequesters the ﬂuid in one or more dimensions (e.g., between two surfaces or in a pore or droplet), ﬂuid behavior depends on the relative size of interfacial and bulk regions. Even the basic phase behavior of the conﬁned ﬂuid can be altered, as is discussed below. The length scale for transition from surface-inﬂuenced to bulk conditions, which, strictly speaking, varies with the speciﬁc property under scrutiny (13), depends on the nature of the interaction between the ﬂuid and the surface and on the nature and thermodynamic state of the ﬂuid. If the direct interaction is short-ranged, then the transition length scale is comparable to the distance over which the molecular positions and orientations are correlated in the pure ﬂuid (a range that depends on thermodynamic state and the role of molecular packing effects). For a typical molecular liquid (well removed from the critical point), this length is of the order of a few molecular diameters—a nanoscale length, longer than typical molecular dimensions, but clearly not macroscopic. If the direct interaction is long-ranged, such as that due to surface charges, then the transition length scale will also be large, potentially leading to long-ranged interfacial forces (14). These long-ranged electrostatic effects are beyond the scope of the present review. In any case, it follows that the conﬁned material can be anticipated to be wholly different from the bulk ﬂuid for conﬁnement length scales that are smaller than twice the transition length scale, because in this case all molecules will fall within the realm of inﬂuence of at least one surface. There need not be any bulk region and the material need not resemble any bulk phase (15). Correspondingly, conﬁnement on the nanoscale produces a state for which we should not anticipate possessing sound intuition.
The widespread recognition that conﬁnement is of special importance in the case of water has spurred an enormous amount of research on aqueous interfaces. The state of water in nanoscale conﬁnement is crucially important in a vast number of technical applications and scientiﬁc ﬁelds. Examples include, ﬁrst, biological assemblies ranging from multisubunit protein complexes (16– 18), to membrane topology (19, 20), to RNA packaging (21), where water mediates the interactions between chemically, electrostatically, and geometrically complex surfaces (22–24). The role of conﬁnement is by no means limited to biosystems but is also critical in fuel cell technology, where rates of proton transport are controlled by membrane hydration (25); nanotribology, where water can control friction between solid surfaces (26); geosciences, where water organization is essential to the structure and rheology of minerals (7); and lab-on-a-chip applications, where water ﬂow in conﬁned geometries occurs under the inﬂuence of thermal, electrical, mechanical, or substrate chemical patterning driving forces (27). Particularly in the area of self-assembly, an understanding of the solvent’s role is widely recognized as a key element for future materials synthesis (28). The self-assembly of designed molecular structures needed to create synthetic functional nanoscale assemblies in an aqueous environment is driven by the same forces that underlie

biological organization (29). Water-based examples include the synthesis of nanopatterned metal surfaces directed by distributions of hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface regions (30) and a variety of patterned porous and nanocomposite materials that can be generated by exploiting the interfacial interactions involving conﬁned water (31).
In this review, we focus on neat conﬁned water. Although, as indicated above, the dynamics of conﬁned water and its consequences are also of great interest (e.g., 13, 32–37), we limit the scope of the present review to structural and thermodynamic properties. We also emphasize pure water and do not discuss aqueous solutions. There is considerable interest in the effect of solutes and cosolvents, particularly in the context of chemical denaturants and stabilizers of biopolymer assembly (38). As a practical matter, these topics go well beyond the present focused presentation.
Given the exceptional complexity and diversity of the contexts in which nanoconﬁned water is expected to play a pivotal role, one approach to developing both a rational understanding of such systems and a set of generalizable principles is to set one’s course on a series of systematic studies of relatively well-deﬁned systems, beginning with the simplest and most homogeneous interface and gradually increasing the topographical and chemical complexity. The fact that terrestrial life exists over a truly remarkably wide range of thermodynamic conditions of temperature and pressure (39, 40) indicates that we should not limit our investigations to the usual ambient conditions if we are to develop a deep, and therefore generalizable and predictive, understanding. In the present review, we focus on the progress resulting from studies in which thermodynamic conditions or surface characteristics are varied systematically. Previous reviews related to interfacial aqueous systems have generally not been focused on systematic studies and have explored ambient conditions exclusively. Recent reviews in the present series have addressed the subject of capillary evaporation and more generally the wetting behavior of nanopores and nanocavities having hydrophobic conﬁning environments (8, 9). Although these subjects intersect those of interest here, the present review emphasizes how the ambient, hydrophobic case relates to the broader spectrum of chemical surfaces and thermodynamic states.
The information of interest here resides at or near the molecular scale. It is therefore not surprising that the vast majority of detailed studies that have formed our vision at this scale to date are theoretical and computational, especially computer simulations of atomistic models. As indicated, experimental measurements are progressing at a fast pace, and we mention a number of important results, but in the present review we emphasize the results of simulation. In this context, we focus on qualitative and conceptual issues, so that the details of the speciﬁc water and interface molecular mechanics models and simulation sampling methods used are highly unlikely to be important players in the results of interest here. Nevertheless, such comparative studies are needed in the future.
The present review is organized as follows: In Section 2, we consider, as a systematic starting point, the thermodynamics of water conﬁned by solid surfaces that are simply impermeable to water. In Section 3, we consider the general case of chemically homogeneous surfaces, addressing results on the effects of temperature and pressure on the phase behavior and corresponding microscopic structure of nanoscale conﬁned water. This includes both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. In Section 4, the role of heterogeneity in the surface chemistry is considered, including patchy hydrophobicity and molecular topography. These results demonstrate that the emergent behavior of an interface is not simply predictable based only on the hydration properties of small molecules. Section 5 concludes with a summary and a discussion of directions that we believe are well positioned for future investigations.
Needless to say, the literature in the area of water at interfaces is so extensive that it is not possible to discuss or even cite all of the relevant work that underlies the current state of knowledge on conﬁned water. Our intent is to capture major points relevant to nanoscale hydration that have

become clear from recent, primarily computational, systematic studies, and to point to particular work in the literature that illustrates these issues.

2. THE THERMODYNAMICS OF CONFINEMENT

The thermodynamics of a liquid conﬁned by impermeable surfaces provides a convenient starting

point for understanding the effects of substrate characteristics, temperature, and pressure on the

properties of water in nanoscopic conﬁnement. If two macroscopic and impermeable objects are

immersed in a liquid, the competition between bulk and surface energetics causes the conﬁned

liquid to become metastable with respect to a conﬁned vapor phase at sufﬁciently small separations

(see, e.g., 9, 41–48). This crossover separation below which a vapor-ﬁlled region between imper-

meable (hard) walls becomes thermodynamically stable is called the evaporation length scale (41).

Numerous researchers have addressed the thermodynamics of conﬁnement-induced evaporation

(9, 41–52). Until very recently (41), no systematic comparison of water’s evaporation length scale

to that of other liquids existed in the literature, nor had calculations based on actual thermophysical

property data been performed.

Consider two parallel solid surfaces separated by a distance d, immersed in a liquid. Comparing

the free energies of the liquid and vapor in the conﬁned region, one obtains an expression for the

crossover separation dc, below which the conﬁned liquid becomes metastable with respect to the

vapor (52):

where γ is the vapor-liquid surface tension, θ is the contact angle of the liquid on the solid surface,

Pl and Pv denote the pressure of the liquid and the vapor at the given (ﬁxed) chemical potential

and temperature, and L is the characteristic dimension of the immersed surfaces, assumed for

convenience to be square. In the limiting case of impermeable surfaces (θ = π ), Equation 1

reduces to

Since Pv is comparable to the vapor pressure, Pl Pv at sufﬁciently subcritical conditions. For water at ambient pressure (P = Pl ∼ 1 bar), the quantity 4γ /LP is of order 103 for nanometer-sized

objects, and in this limit one has, from Equation 2,

dc = L/2.

(3)

Under these conditions, the critical separation below which a nanoscopically conﬁned liquid (e.g., water) becomes metastable with respect to vaporization is independent of the liquid itself, and of thermodynamic conditions (T, P), and scales as the size of the immersed impermeable object. The majority of computational studies of water in nanoscale hydrophobic conﬁnement performed to date fall squarely in this regime, although this has seldom been pointed out (41, 52, 53). Of course, Equation 3 presumes that the conﬁned liquid can be treated as homogeneous, and its thermodynamics can accurately be described in terms of macroscopic, “pressure × volume” and “surface tension × area” terms. In water at ambient conditions, this limit is attained when L exceeds approximately 3 nm (54). For a microscopic treatment of the thermodynamics of nanoscale conﬁnement, see Reference 55.
In the opposite limit of large immersed surfaces (4γ /LP 1), Equation 2 reads

dc (nm)

For water at ambient conditions, this limit is attained when the immersed impermeable surface is of macroscopic dimensions (ca. 1 μm). Note that the transition from small to large immersed surface, that is to say from Equation 3 to Equation 4, is sensitive to pressure: Conﬁnement between nanometer-sized impermeable objects at 1 bar gives rise to nanometer-sized substance-, T-, and Pindependent evaporation lengths (Equation 3), but to substance-, T-, and P-dependent nanometersized evaporation lengths at 1 kbar.
Expanding Pl and Pv about the vapor pressure at the given T, and using the fact that ρlσ ρvσ , where σ denotes vapor-liquid equilibrium conditions at the given temperature, one obtains the relationship (41, 48),

Pl − Pv ≈ ρl,σ μ,

where μ = μ – μσ . Equation 4 can then be rewritten as (41, 42, 52)

The preceding thermodynamic argument is general, and the only distinction between different substances lies in the value of the physical properties contributing to dc. Figure 1 shows dc values for water and eight common organic liquids as a function of distance from the boiling temperature at atmospheric pressure (41). It can be seen that dc is a macroscopic quantity for all substances, but is signiﬁcantly larger for water than for the other substances considered in Figure 1. This difference is due solely to the large value of water’s interfacial tension (41). This follows from the fact that ρlσ μ (see Equation 6) approaches the substance-independent limit Pl (1 bar in Figure 1) at low temperatures (i.e., when Pσ ≈ Pv Pl).
The quantity dc is a measure of the thermodynamic driving force for evaporation in conﬁnement: The larger the driving force, the larger the maximum distance between hydrophobic surfaces that can support a stable vapor phase in the conﬁned region. Thus, Equations 1–4 and 6 provide

a qualitative and systematic way for understanding the effects of surface properties, temperature, and pressure on the vapor-liquid phase behavior of water in nanoscale conﬁnement.
The preceding discussion addresses the thermodynamic aspects of conﬁnement exclusively. The kinetic aspects of this problem have received much less attention (52, 56, 57), but are equally important. Extension of the thermodynamic analysis to mixtures is also of considerable interest.
3. CHEMICALLY HOMOGENEOUS SURFACES
3.1. Water Phase Behavior: Pressure Effects
Perhaps the most basic effect of nanoscale conﬁnement on water is the emergence of new phase behavior. For example, though bulk water at normal pressure and temperature is a liquid, hydrophobic conﬁnement can induce capillary evaporation, as introduced in the section above, or even crystallization into new phases that are unrelated to any of the known bulk ices, as is discussed below. Instead, hydrophilic conﬁnement tends to stabilize the liquid phase, even under thermodynamic conditions where bulk water is a vapor.
Wallqvist & Berne (58) were the ﬁrst to study capillary evaporation of water under hydrophobic conﬁnement computationally, although the generality of corresponding results observed for simple liquids with nonwetting surfaces had been noted (44). Using hydrophobic nanoscale ellipsoidal solutes, they observed that water conﬁned at separations of ∼1 nm between the surfaces vaporized, whereas water outside the conﬁned volume remained in the liquid phase. Capillary evaporation under hydrophobic conﬁnement has since been observed in a large number of computer simulations (see, e.g., 56, 59–61). The phenomenon is robust, being seen in studies with different model hydrophobic surfaces, including crystalline (61, 62), amorphous protein-like (63, 64), and smooth apolar walls (65); in a variety of conﬁned geometries (66, 67); and employing a diverse set of water models, including rigid, nonrigid, and polarizable models (68, 69). We note, however, that capillary evaporation is very sensitive to the water-wall interactions (8, 9), and there are several studies with carbon-based conﬁning surfaces demonstrating that evaporation can be suppressed by small enhancements in water-wall dispersive (van der Waals) interactions (45, 62, 66, 70–72).
Most computer simulation studies of water in nanoscale, hydrophobic conﬁnement have been performed at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. This perspective was appreciably broadened by a study of the effects of pressure on the phase behavior of water conﬁned between two parallel, silica-based, apolar surfaces (61). Figure 2 shows a schematic phase diagram at T = 300 K from Reference 61. The conﬁning surfaces are two parallel ﬁnite plates of area ∼3.2 × 3.2 nm2 immersed within a larger sample of bulk water. At P ∼ 0 GPa, conﬁned water remains in the liquid phase above the separation d > 0.8 nm; below an apparent critical separation of d ∼ dc ∼ 0.8 nm, evaporation occurs between the surfaces. Figure 2 also shows that, in agreement with thermodynamic predictions for macroscopic systems (see Section 2), dc(P) decreases with increasing pressure. This is a nontrivial observation, as it is not obvious that the surfaces considered in Figure 2 are truly macroscopic, in the sense implied by Equation 4, as opposed to nanoscopic, as implied by Equation 3. Furthermore, the ﬁnite molecular dynamics (MD) simulation times imply that the dc(P) locus is approximate, rather than a true vapor-liquid coexistence line. Nonetheless, these results are consistent with Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations of water conﬁned by smooth apolar surfaces (73). The decrease of dc with increasing pressure is consistent with the simulated water density near isolated hydrophobic interfaces, where the low interfacial density at ambient conditions increases upon compression (74, 75).

Figure 2 shows that at moderately high pressure, conﬁned water crystallizes even when the temperature is kept at T = 300 K for d ∼ 0.6 nm. In Reference 61, the crystal is shown to be composed of two fully hydrogen-bonded layers of molecules arranged in ﬂat hexagons and in registry with one another. Although the hexagons of the observed bilayer ice (61) are commensurate with the walls’ regular atomistic structure (76), a similar bilayer ice was observed previously by Koga et al. using smooth hydrophobic surfaces (77, 78). A rich variety of different ices have been observed in computer simulations of water conﬁned between parallel hydrophobic walls at high pressures. These include two bilayer ices, one ice form being composed of molecules arranged in pentagons, whereas the other includes pentagons and seven-molecule rings (79). The formation of a dodecagonal quasi-crystal has also been reported (79), as well as monolayer (80, 81) and trilayer ices (81). In carbon nanotubes, topologically complex ices, such as square and helical phases, are seen (82, 83). In all these cases, the conﬁned ices are very sensitive to the dimensions and geometry of the system (76, 83), and the driving force for ice formation is the drastic limitation on structural diversity for a fully hydrogen-bonded ﬂuid compatible with the conﬁning geometry. Crystallization of water at the nanoscale well above the bulk freezing point has been conﬁrmed in experiments: Jinesh & Frenken (84) report ice between the tungsten tip of a high-resolution friction force microscope and a graphite surface at room temperature; formation of ice within single-wall carbon nanotubes is reported by Maniwa et al. (85); and an ice with the structure predicted in Reference 61 has been reported in ﬁlms grown on a supported graphene substrate at T∼100–135 K (86).
There is a potential mechanistic role for conﬁnement-induced evaporation in hydrophobic surface self-assembly (42, 54). For example, evaporation of water conﬁned between two nanoscale hydrophobic particles would result in aggregation of the particles. Because dc(P) decreases with increasing pressure (Figure 2), it follows that this route to assembly should be suppressed as pressure increases. Further, it is clear from the discussion in Section 2 that evaporation has requirements not only for the degree of hydrophobicity but also for the size of the hydrophobic

domain (e.g., 45, 62, 71, 87–89; see also Section 4.2). Whether evaporation plays a mechanistic role in any speciﬁc experimental example of molecular self-assembly remains to be shown, but it is well established that hydrophobic interactions are suppressed by pressure. For example, proteins denature at high pressures, above a few kilobars (90, 91), and calculations based on information theory and on detailed computer simulations indicate that increasing hydrostatic pressure forces water molecules into the hydrophobic core of globular proteins (92), eventually breaking down the protein structure (93, 94).
The rich phase diagram of water conﬁned by hydrophobic surfaces contrasts with the quite simple phase behavior observed under hydrophilic nanoscale conﬁnement. When the hydrophobic surfaces leading to Figure 2 are hydroxylated, the vapor is not expected (see Section 2) and crystal phases are no longer observed, at least in the range of −0.15 ≤ P ≤ 0.2 GPa and d ≤ 1.6 nm (61). Instead, simulations suggest that the hydrophilic surface stabilizes the liquid phase, even at thermodynamic conditions at which the stable bulk phase is vapor (61); i.e., hydrophilic surfaces can induce capillary wetting. Regarding crystallization, we speculate that the mobile polar (i.e., silanol) groups in the hydrophilic case allow for more molecular structural diversity at the interface while still being consistent with the satisfaction of hydrogen bonds and, accordingly, crystallization would be overall less favorable. This delicate balance is suggested by the observation of a bilayer ice in simulations of K+-water solutions conﬁned by charged mica surfaces (95).
3.2. Microscopic Responses to Pressure
Because hydrophobic conﬁnement has the tendency to stabilize the vapor phase, whereas hydrophilic conﬁnement tends to favor the liquid phase, it follows that the pressure response of nanoconﬁned water is determined largely by the chemistry of the conﬁning surfaces. Simulations indicate that hydrophobic conﬁnement increases water’s density ﬂuctuations, and hence its isothermal compressibility, relative to bulk water (61, 62, 73, 96). At constant pressure, water’s compressibility and density ﬂuctuations increase as d → dc(P); at ﬁxed d, both quantities increase with decreasing pressure (61, 62, 73). One can conclude that, analogous to bulk liquids, density ﬂuctuations in the conﬁned liquid increase as the vapor phase is approached. In contrast, under hydrophilic conﬁnement, water compressibility remains similar to its value in the bulk over a wide range of pressures (61).
Recent computer simulation studies have revealed that enhanced interfacial density ﬂuctuations near hydrophobic nanoscale solutes (75, 97–99) give rise to transient dry and wet regions (75), consistent with enhanced compressibility in hydrophobic conﬁnement (96). Interestingly, the enhanced interfacial density ﬂuctuations are observed even when the surface attraction for water is sufﬁcient to not only quench the formation of a vapor ﬁlm next to the surface, but even to induce moderate wetting (97–99). For stronger attraction, when the surfaces are hydrophilic, interfacial density ﬂuctuations become similar to those observed in the bulk liquid (96, 98, 99), which is in agreement with the bulk-like water compressibility (61). Zhang et al. (100) provide some experimental support for the view that water ﬂuctuations at extended hydrophobic (hydrophilic) interfaces are vapor-like (liquid-like). They performed shear deformation experiments of water conﬁned between two surfaces, one hydrophobic and another hydrophilic. The observation of large amplitude viscous force ﬂuctuations only near the hydrophobic surface suggests that the hydrophobic surface ﬂuctuates in its wetting state, a result consistent with computer simulations (88).
Structurally, though compression enhances the local density of water everywhere, that enhancement is greatest immediately adjacent to hydrophobic surfaces (61, 96), an effect that diminishes with increasing pressure (75, 97). In the case of hydrophilic surfaces (61), the interfacial solvent is

“hard”; the density peak sharpens only slightly and does not displace in position upon compression. It follows that the differences in interfacial water properties at hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces become less pronounced as pressure increases; at pressures above ∼2 kbars, the interfacial water densities for water in contact with hydrophobic or hydroxylated silica are nearly the same (61, 101). This pressure-induced wetting of hydrophobic surfaces is consistent with protein denaturation at pressures above a few kilobars (90, 91).
Computer simulations (see, e.g., 71, 102, 103) and experiment (104) show that water molecules next to an extended (roughly of linear dimension >1 nm) ﬂat hydrophobic surface orient preferentially with one hydrogen bond direction pointing into the surface, resembling the molecular orientation at the vapor-liquid interface (105, 106), in agreement with Stillinger’s prediction (107). For hydroxylated silica, molecules have an orientation that is complementary, with one electron lone pair pointing preferentially outward and forming about three hydrogen bonds with the surface (103, 108). This characteristic molecular orientation is remarkably robust upon compression, at least to pressures of 2 kbars (61).

3.3. Water Phase Behavior: Temperature Effects
Temperature has a pronounced effect on the phase behavior of hydrophobically conﬁned water (109). This is evidenced in Figure 3, which shows the regions of stability in the (P, d ) plane, and is analogous to Figure 2, but at T = 220 K. 220 K is the reported freezing point at atmospheric pressure for the water model used to generate the data in these ﬁgures (110). Figure 3 clearly shows that cooling shifts the evaporation boundary dc(P) to lower values of d and P. In Reference 53, the behavior of water conﬁned by nanoscale hydrophobic circular plates is reported at temperatures of 280 ≤ T ≤ 360 K and P = 1 bar, and it is also found that dc decreases upon cooling. Interestingly, the dependence of dc on temperature is estimated well by macroscopic thermodynamics (see Section 2) (53). These results are consistent with the expectation of weaker hydrophobic interactions with decreasing temperatures, as exempliﬁed by the cold-induced unfolding of proteins (90, 94).

In accord with the expectation that the crystallization of conﬁned water is favored by cooling, the simulations in Reference 109, shown in Figure 3, indicate an expanded crystalline phase region compared to 300 K (see Figure 2). Available experimental results suggest that the conﬁnement geometry is critical in determining the freezing temperature, however. High-temperature water crystallization has been observed within single-wall carbon nanotubes of ∼1.1–1.5 nm diameter at normal pressure (85), whereas water conﬁnement in carbon-based amorphous pores of radius ∼1.4 nm appears to suppress crystallization down to 130 K, ∼100 K below the homogeneous nucleation temperature of bulk water (111). Under hydrophilic conﬁnement, experiments suggest that in hydroxylated 1.5–3-nm silica pores, crystallization is comparably suppressed (112–115).
Finally, water is well known for exhibiting an anomalous density maximum upon cooling, occurring in bulk at P = 1 atm and T = 277 K. Simulations of water conﬁned by hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces separated by 1–2 nm show that conﬁnement can shift water anomalies to lower temperatures (81) or even suppress them completely (109), which is a result consistent with indications from experiments using silica pores (111). Related experiments recently reported the existence of a density minimum (115). The interpretation of these results is currently a subject of debate (114).
3.4. Microscopic Responses to Temperature
It follows from Figures 2 and 3 that isobaric cooling and isothermal compression tend to stabilize the conﬁned liquid phase relative to the vapor. Interfacial water structure in these simulated systems reﬂects these thermodynamic trends (61, 109). Independent of whether the surfaces are hydrophobic or hydrophilic, isobaric cooling enhances the local density of water everywhere in the conﬁned volume and particularly at the interfaces. However, at least for the silica-based surfaces examined in References 61, 109, only in the hydrophobic case do molecules actually displace toward the solid surface upon cooling. The orientational features characteristic of water molecules next to hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces remain robust to temperature changes for all conditions explored (61, 109).
Comparing the water densities proximal to hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces (109), one ﬁnds that at T = 300 K, the local density of water next to the hydrophobic surface has a much lower value than for that of the hydrophilic case. However, at T = 220 K, the simulated solvent density at the hydrophobic surface is considerably enhanced and becomes similar to the hydrophilic case. In this quite evident sense, at least, cooling reduces the surface hydrophobicity. The resulting higher thermal expansion coefﬁcient (TEC) at a hydrophobic surface is consistent with the expectation that density ﬂuctuations at these different interfaces (96) should become increasingly similar upon isobaric cooling.
We note that an enhanced expansivity under conﬁnement can have practical implications. For example, thermal expansion stresses in cement pastes can produce cracks that raise the permeability and reduce the strength of concrete (116). In fact, direct dilatometric measurements of water conﬁned in (hydrophilic) 3–13-nm pore silica reveal a pronounced increase in the TEC relative to the bulk, and this effect becomes more pronounced as the pore size decreases (116). MD simulations of a dissociative water model conﬁned by amorphous hydrophilic silica ﬂat surfaces separated by 3–7 nm indicate that the increased TEC originates within a distance of only ∼0.6 nm from the surfaces (117; see also 34, 118, 119), which is consistent with elevated values in the TEC when water is conﬁned by hydrophilic crystalline silica surfaces (109). When the conﬁning surfaces are hydrophobic, the TEC enhancement is even larger (109).

4. CHEMICALLY HETEROGENEOUS SURFACES
We have seen that the phase behavior and interfacial structure properties of nanoscale conﬁned water are very responsive to the hydrophobicity of the conﬁning surface. Quantifying a surface’s degree of hydrophobicity, e.g., by the water contact angle, provides an additional dimension to our understanding of conﬁned water behavior. Further, other surface properties can play important roles in inﬂuencing the behavior of interfacial liquid water, including surface geometry (e.g., slit versus cylindrical pores), topography (e.g., nanoscale roughness), and especially chemical heterogeneity or patchiness (i.e., distributed apolar and polar surface motifs). Simple characterizations of surfaces as hydrophobic or hydrophilic, based, for example, on contact angle, are likely to prove insufﬁcient to predict water’s interfacial behavior (98). In this section, we discuss studies of how such surface characteristics inﬂuence the behavior of liquid water conﬁned at the nanoscale.
4.1. Variation in Surface Polarity
Apolar surfaces are hydrophobic, at least when realistic dispersive surface-water interactions are considered. Conversely, polar surfaces are usually considered hydrophilic. However, the magnitude of surface polarity is a continuum variable. Recent computer simulation studies indicate that, in some cases, polar surfaces can also be hydrophobic.
Computer simulations of water droplets on hydrophilic hydroxylated crystalline silica surfaces (103) show that the water contact angle is ∼0◦, meaning that a water droplet spreads completely over the surface. When the surface bares no hydroxylation (no surface atom partial charges), the water contact angle is ∼108◦ and the surface becomes hydrophobic. If one treats the polarity associated with the hydroxylated silica surface as a continuous variable, and the atomic model surface charges are scaled by a factor of k ≤ 0.4, the polar surface becomes nominally hydrophobic (103), i.e., the water contact angle is larger than 90◦. The crossover value, k = 0.4, yields a surface silanol group dipole moment that is ∼40% that of a water molecule, so this surface polarity is not negligible.
The possibility that one can have a polar hydrophobic surface raises interesting questions: Can such a surface induce drying in nanoscale conﬁnement? Is it possible to have hydrophobic self-assembly of polar hydrophobic (e.g., bio-) surfaces? These questions were addressed by Hua et al. (88) using computer simulations of heterogeneous surfaces. The surfaces were composed of a square, 7 × 7 arrangement of Lennard-Jones spheres and were made hydrophilic by assigning charges of value q = +/− 0.4e to roughly 50% of the surface sites. This value of q is close to the charge of H atoms in common interaction site water models. To avoid short-range electrostatic repulsion between the plates, the surface charge distributions were arranged with opposing charges in registry. Five different patterns were considered, and in four of them an evaporation transition occurred for small plate separations in the range of dc ∼ 0.9–1.05 nm. Moreover, in the four cases where evaporation was observed, the net free energy for self-assembly was negative: Self-assembly of polar hydrophobic surfaces is indeed possible. When the surface partial charges were doubled, q = +/− 0.8e, complete evaporation was suppressed in most cases and self-assembly was no longer favored.
Additional examples of polar hydrophobic surfaces, as reported by the simulated contact angle, are provided in References 120 and 121. Wang et al. (120) provide a model with an intriguing “coating” mechanism. A graphene-like structure with relatively large partial positive and negative charges (0.5 e ≤ |q| ≤ 1.0e) located regularly on the surface atoms adsorbs a water monolayer, and on top of this monolayer, a water droplet possesses a contact angle >90◦. Although the polar

surface is indeed wet, it is the particular structure adopted by the water monolayer that has a hydrophobic character.
4.2. Surface Patchiness
MD simulations of water next to patchy surfaces indicate that water density next to nanoscale hydrophobic patches can be inﬂuenced substantially by nearby hydrophilic motifs. For example, in Reference 101, it is shown that, near ambient conditions, the density of water in the ﬁrst hydration layer of a nanometer-scale hydrophobic domain on a silica-based surface increases by ∼60% if that domain is decorated by a hydroxylated border. In contrast, simulations show that the density of water next to nanometer-scale hydrophilic domains is not diminished by the presence of adjacent hydrophobic patches (101). It follows that hydrophilic motifs can induce wetting of nearby hydrophobic domains, a hydrophilic “invasive effect.” Not surprisingly, the extra water molecules at the interface with the hydrophobic motif are located preferentially near the boundary between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches, suggesting that, in a very qualitative way, the line tension between hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches favors hydrophilic species.
The role of density ﬂuctuations in interfacial and conﬁned systems was originally highlighted using coarse-grained models (122, 123), and recent studies have shown that the local value of compressibility, κT , can be used as an indicator of the local hydrophobicity, even in situations where the surface is chemically heterogeneous. The above-mentioned hydrophilic invasive effect is evident in this quantitative analysis. Garde et al. (96) studied the local isothermal compressibility κT of water next to heterogeneous self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The SAMs were composed of alkane chains (C10) terminated with different head groups: Hydroxyl (-OH) groups terminated hydrophilic surface sites, and methyl (-CH3) groups terminated hydrophobic sites. They found that the presence of a single hydrophobic site on a hydrophilic surface hardly affected the local water compressibility κT relative to the homogenous hydrophilic surface. Speciﬁcally, introducing a single hydrophobic site caused κT , the water compressibility, to increase from κT ∼ κT bulk to only κT ∼ 2 κT bulk in the immediate proximity of that new site, whereas the presence of a single hydrophilic site on a hydrophobic surface reduced local compressibility from κT ∼ 12 κT bulk to κT ∼ 4 κT bulk. Interestingly, in the case of the single hydrophilic site, the effects on local compressibility were relatively long ranged, up to ∼0.7 nm away from the (-OH) group. Of particular note, the effect of patchiness on the interaction of small hydrophobic probe molecules with the surface (96) supported the same local view: Apolar probe solutes were excluded from the region around the (-OH) head group in the hydrophobic (-CH3) background, whereas no local enhancement of probe solute population was found in the vicinity of the (-CH3) head group in the hydrophilic (-OH) background.
The hydrophilic invasive effect is also evident in phase behavior. The evaporation transition in the presence of patchy surfaces is largely suppressed by the presence of hydrophilic motifs. Koishi et al. (124) studied the evaporation transition between surfaces with checker-board patterns of different patch sizes. They found that a transition occurs at a hydrophobic domain size of side length ∼1 nm. For larger sizes, local evaporation at small gaps occurs next to the hydrophobic patches, forming a stable nanobubble. For somewhat smaller patches, only transient nanobubbles were observed. A similar conclusion is obtained by Hua et al. (88), using a different, but qualitatively similar surface model. The smallest hydrophobic domain capable of inducing a stable nanobubble between two plates was ∼1 nm in side length, and surrounding hydrophilic motifs blur the effective hydrophobicity of the patch and suppress capillary evaporation. Further simulations conducted by Hua et al. (88) and Koishi et al. (124) reinforced these conclusions by showing that when small hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains (<0.3 nm in side length) are distributed

PC63CH09-Debenedetti ARI 27 February 2012 13:54
homogeneously on the surface in a checker-board pattern, drying does not occur. However, if the same hydrophobic sites are rearranged on the surface to form patches of approximately 1 nm in side length, local nanobubbles form. Even molecular-scale perturbations can be important. When ∼3-nm edge hydrophobic silica plates are decorated with a single silanol group at the center (101), local evaporation occurs at low pressure and small values of d (see Figure 2), but a persistent bridge of water molecules spans the gap between the silanol site of each plate.
The hydrophilic invasive effect would seem to imply that hydrophobic attraction between such domains will be weakened by nearby hydrophilic motifs, affecting self-assembly processes. According to Hua et al. (88), the potential of mean force (PMF, the solute coordinate dependent free energy in the presence of the solvent) between pairs of the 7 × 7 patchy model surfaces discussed above is calculated for different surface patterns. Depending on the pattern, the PMF between plates can be repulsive for all plate separations or include attractions for preferential plate separations that indicate favorable hydrophobicity-induced aggregation. The PMF is also remarkably sensitive to the strength of the hydrophilic sites. For weak site hydrophilicity, where most surfaces induce evaporation, an attractive PMF at small interplate separations is found.
These results taken together indicate that the interaction between patchy nanoscale surfaces is the result of cooperative interactions between the surface motifs and argues against additivity of free energy contributions from different nanoscale surface domains (96, 125). These observations are particularly relevant to complex system self-assembly, such as in protein-protein interactions, where the simpliﬁcation of additivity is assumed in implicit solvent models that use hydrophobic surface area terms to account for hydrophobic forces (see, e.g., 126).
4.3. Nanoscale Surface Topography Micron-sized droplets on typical ﬂat hydrophobic surfaces have contact angles of 100◦ to 120◦. However, if the surface is made rough, water contact angles can be as high as 160◦ to 175◦ (127), resulting in a “superhydrophobic” surface. It would follow that conﬁned water behavior can be largely affected by roughness of the conﬁning surface. Interfacial-force microscopy experiments reveal that rough hydrophobic surfaces (contact angle ∼170◦) experience attractive forces over distances more than 30 times greater than commonly observed with typical hydrophobic surfaces, and this greater attractive force is attributed to the spontaneous evaporation of the intervening conﬁned water (128).
The effects of nanoscale surface curvature on water structure and energetics at a natural hydrophobic interface were studied using simulation by Cheng & Rossky (18). They studied a polypeptide assembly (melittin dimer) that exhibits a relatively ﬂat hydrophobic surface domain (∼0.5 nm2) surrounded by convex hydrophobic domains. Near the ﬂat domain, water molecules exhibited ﬂuctuations between orientations characteristic of small solutes and those characteristic of extended ﬂat surfaces (102) or concave regions (129) that involve hydrogen bond loss. Instead, clathrate-like structures dominate near convex surface patches. These simulations clearly showed how molecular-scale surface topography could affect the interfacial energetics and, hence, the surface hydrophobicity.
Systematic computer simulations of nanoscale water droplets in contact with realistic ﬂat surfaces (130–132) provide contact angles consistent with corresponding experiments. Interestingly, similar simulations indicate that superhydrophobicity can also be achieved by nanoscale roughness of hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces (133, 134). Correspondingly, water conﬁned by molecularly rough hydrophobic nanoscale surfaces should be more prone to evaporation during a selfassembly process (135). In recent work, Mittal & Hummer (24) used computer simulations to

study the effect of roughness on the interfacial free energy of a thin (∼1.5- to 3-nm) ﬁlm of water conﬁned by one ﬂat surface and one parallel interface roughened by a periodic molecular-scale wavelength and amplitude. It was found that increasing the roughness by either reducing the wavelength or increasing the amplitude increased the interfacial density ﬂuctuations and raised the interfacial free energy of the ﬁlm. The increase of surface roughness was also accompanied by a decrease in the number of water molecules in the valleys formed between surface protrusions, whereas those remaining had a reduced number of hydrogen bonds. Thus, the results of Mittal & Hummer (24) also imply that, in principle, the surface roughness could be used to tune the interfacial free energy of the ﬁlm.
4.4. Biological Surfaces
Biological surfaces are perhaps the most complex systems that one may encounter when dealing with nanoconﬁned water, making it challenging to generalize water behavior in model systems to the context of biological conﬁnement. Biological surfaces have a complex topography, are patchy, and normally exhibit a wide range of surface charge distribution and polarities. In addition, biological surfaces are expected to be ﬂexible and to exhibit signiﬁcant thermal ﬂuctuations.
Nevertheless, the phase behavior of water conﬁned by biological surfaces can be productively compared to that for model homogeneous surfaces. For example, in the presence of hydrophobic silica-based surfaces, conﬁnement can induce crystallization or drying (Figure 2). Crystallization has not been observed in computer simulations of water conﬁned by biological surfaces, presumably a direct result of the heterogeneity of the surfaces (87). Computer simulations exploring capillary evaporation indicate that drying may occur but is not typical. Water conﬁned between the subunit surfaces from a relatively large number of protein multimers was studied by Hua et al. (136). Protein structures were selected based on a scoring function using the distribution and size of hydrophobic subunit surface domains, and most likely cases were simulated with explicit solvent. Even with the preselection, less than ∼30% of the protein complexes studied (136) exhibited drying.
The formation of vapor in biological conﬁned geometries is very sensitive to the local surface properties. For example, a drying transition was observed in simulations of water conﬁned inside a nanochannel formed by two melittin dimers (63). However, single residue mutations to less hydrophobic residues were sufﬁcient to suppress evaporation. Simulations with the twodomain protein BphC enzyme show no evaporation transition; drying occurred if the surface partial charges were eliminated (64). In accord with the results for model surfaces, simulations suggest that evaporation can occur in biological geometries characterized by surfaces with large aligned connected hydrophobic areas (63, 136). The inherent chemical heterogeneity of biological surfaces can strongly inﬂuence the hydration structure and energetics of hydrophobic domains and, thus, affect evaporation (18, 137, 138).
In recent work (87), we performed simulations of water conﬁned between two melittin dimers designed to separate the effects of surface topology and chemistry (63) by removing roughness; each dimer surface was ﬂattened while maintaining the chemistry. In this way, it was possible to assess directly the chemical inﬂuence on phase behavior by comparing water conﬁned by two prototypical but ﬂat hydrophobic biological surfaces with water phase behavior observed with idealized, atomically smooth, ﬂat hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. Simulations showed that the protein surface was distinctly less hydrophobic than idealized surfaces: Evaporation occurred at surface separation that sterically barely permitted a single water layer, the solvent compressibility was closer to bulk than for hydrophobic (Lennard-Jones) silica, and evaporation occurred only in a small central region between the protein surfaces, next to an apolar amino acid. When a polar

residue replaced that single amino acid, drying was eliminated. The simulations performed with ﬂat surfaces (87) show a smaller vapor region than observed with the native, rough (63) melittin dimers, indicating that the topology of the conﬁnement can play a major role in drying.
The correlation of hydrophobicity and local solvent compressibility is now well established in the context of biological interfaces. Simulations of the proteins hydrophobin-II (HYD), lysozyme, and staph nuclease (SNS) show that water compressibility at the interface is slightly larger (κT ∼ 1.7 κT bulk) than that of bulk water, indicating a relatively hydrophilic character of the protein surface (96). HYD in water also shows enhanced (diminished ) ﬂuctuations, relative to bulk water, next to speciﬁc hydrophobic (hydrophilic) interfacial sites (96). MD simulations of trypsin and hen egg white lysozyme indicate that the corresponding ﬁrst hydration shell manifests average compressibilities that are actually less than bulk water (77% and 68% of bulk values, respectively) (139), indicating a hydrophilic interfacial environment. As one might anticipate, the average hydration shell compressibility increases appreciably in the unfolded state, when hydrophobic residues are exposed to water. For example, water compressibility at the interface of unfolded SNS was found to increase to κT ∼3.6–4.5 κT bulk (96).
5. SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
This review focuses on recent insights gained, mainly through computer simulations, on the effects of pressure, temperature, and surface characteristics on the structure and thermodynamics of water conﬁned on nanometer length scales. Water in nanoscale hydrophobic conﬁnement is highly compressible, and the resulting sensitive response to pressure is likely of relevance to important biophysical phenomena such as pressure-induced protein denaturation (61). Water’s response to temperature, which can lead to the progressive wetting of hydrophobic cavities upon cooling, is likely of relevance to cold denaturation of proteins (109). Differences between proximal water behavior at hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces are progressively blurred upon isobaric cooling and isothermal compression.
Surface patchiness introduces nonlinear effects whereby an atomic-scale hydrophilic site on an otherwise hydrophobic surface modiﬁes proximal water behavior (for example, by suppressing density ﬂuctuations) to a signiﬁcantly larger extent than is found to occur in the corresponding symmetric case of atomic-scale hydrophobicity on an otherwise hydrophilic background (61, 96, 101). Treating surface polarity as a continuously tunable variable, it is possible to induce aspects of nominally hydrophobic behavior on polar surfaces (98, 103, 121).
Although the above summarized insights have advanced fundamental understanding of water in nanoscale conﬁnement, they have also raised intriguing questions whose exploration suggests several avenues for productive future inquiry. Diverse quantities have been used or proposed for the characterization of surface hydrophobicity. These include contact angle (103), density ﬂuctuations (96, 98), free energy of cavity formation (96), and the occurrence of capillary evaporation (87, 136). Understanding the relationship between these properties is a prerequisite for the development of a quantitative and microscopically-based understanding of surface hydrophobicity. Independent of the metrics that one can use to characterize hydrophobicity, the question of how the various properties of a surface, such as topography, polarity, patchiness, and local curvature, interact and combine to determine a surface’s effective hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity should be the subject of future computational studies. Special emphasis should, in our opinion, be placed on the precise, quantitative elucidation of nonlinear effects associated with patchiness (96, 101).
The richness of behavior summarized in this review should not obscure the fact that space limitations have dictated a highly selective choice of topics. We have not considered the effects of nanoscale conﬁnement on mixture behavior (140), transport properties (13, 141), or kinetics

of phase transitions such as capillary evaporation (56). These are all important aspects of water’s behavior in nanoscale conﬁnement.
The resulting research agenda as outlined above, involving both topics that we have not addressed in this review as well as new questions raised by the investigations summarized herein, is unusually rich and challenging. We believe that its pursuit will result in important progress in fundamental materials science, biophysics, and liquid-state theory, as well as in engineering applications such as microﬂuidics, nanotribology, high-throughput screening (materials design, medical diagnostics), and the rational design of biomaterials.
SUMMARY POINTS 1. Water conﬁned at the nanoscale can exhibit new phase behavior, including the formation
of vapor at room temperature and crystallization into new phases that are unrelated to any of the known bulk ices. 2. Water in nanoscale hydrophobic conﬁnement is highly compressible, and the resulting sensitive response to pressure is likely of relevance to important biophysical phenomena such as pressure-induced protein denaturation. 3. Water’s response to temperature, which can lead to the progressive wetting of hydrophobic cavities upon cooling, is likely of relevance to cold denaturation of proteins. 4. Differences between proximal water behavior at hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces are progressively blurred upon isobaric cooling and isothermal compression. 5. Surface patchiness introduces nonlinear effects whereby an atomic scale hydrophilic site on an otherwise hydrophobic surface modiﬁes proximal water behavior (for example, by suppressing density ﬂuctuations) to a signiﬁcantly larger extent than is found to occur in the corresponding symmetric case of atomic-scale hydrophobicity on an otherwise hydrophilic background. 6. Treating surface polarity as a continuously tunable variable, it is possible to induce aspects of nominally hydrophobic behavior on polar surfaces.
