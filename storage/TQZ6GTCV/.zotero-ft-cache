ABSTRACT
Empirical equations for surface tension of propane and normal butane as functions of reduced temperature are obtained from experimental data. Another correlation relating surface tension to enthalpy of vaporization is given for these two compounds. In addition, new parachor numbers are calculated for the normal paraffin hydrocarbons. These numbers are utilized for the calculation of interfacial tension of two-component systems as functions of pressure and Jemperature, using a modified form of WeinaugKatz equation. The experimental data for two binary systems are approximated by the correlation. From these results it is found that the interfacial tension in the high-pressure region remains extremely low at large pressure decrements below the critical pressure. Thus, it appears that condensate systems may have flow characteristics almost like singlephase conditions even though the pressure is within the two-phase region.
Experimental data have shown that interfacial tension divided by density difference approaches zero as the critical pressure is approached. A calculation of wetting-phase saturations indicates that the saturation gradient at the two-phase contact becomes increasingly abrupt as the critical pressure is approached.

DISCUSSION
Prediction of the surface and interfacial tension of the light hydrocarbons and of two-component hydrocarbon mixtures at various temperatures and pressures may be made i£ other physical properties are known. Extensive experimental work on singlecomponent and binary systems 1 is the basis for the correlations outlined in this paper.

Interfacial tension is defined as the specific surface-free energy between two phases of unlike fractional composition, while surface tension is defined as the specific surface-free energy between two phases of the same fractional composition. The usual definitions relating interfacial tension to a liquid-liquid interface and surface tension to a gas-liquid interface are not clearly defined when the critical regi~n is included, and there is no sharp distinction between a gas and a liquid phase.
Interfacial tension is probably the most important single force that makes one-half to one-third of the total oil actually in place in a reservoir rock unrecoverable by conventional gas-drive or waterflood methods. A rough estimate of this figure for the United States is 100 billion bbl. Interfacial tension presently is used by petroleum engineers in the estimation of saturation gradients at the gas-oil contact and at the oil-water contact. The data in this paper should prove useful for estimates of reserves involving gas-oil contacts. Relative permeability undoubtedly is influenced by interfacial tension, for sufficiently small values. These data should be useful in determining how small the values are. In addition, these data should eventually add to our fundamental knowledge of surfaces. At the critical point, all surface excesses approach zero and the thickness becomes very large.

SINGLE-COMPONENT SYSTEMS

It has been observedl that the following relationships are good approximations to the physical properties of propane and n-butane.

For propane, I'lp = 0.80 (l_TITc )O.326, Y = 49.5

y = 91.2 1'lp3.66.

The exponents for propane and n-butane are taken from log-log plots. The last equation may be recognized as the surface tension-density difference relationship leading to Sugden's parachor,3 with the
exponent "3/11" rather than "1/4". That is,
P = MC3/11 = M y3/11

where P = parachor, and M = molecular weight.
From this modified equation, new values of parachor were calculated for some of the normal paraffin hydrocarbons. Surface-tension and densitydifference data for methane, ethane, n-decane and n-e icosane were taken from Rossini,4 for n-pentane from Sage and LaceyS and from Katz,6 and for propane and n-butane from Sage and Lacey and from experimental work'! The values are shown in Table 1. Because the parachor is (ideally) independent of temperature, the values of surface tension and density difference were selected at the temperature at which the best data were obtainable or at the
temperature at which the vapor density is negligible if this latter data were not available. Fig. 1 shows a regular increase in the parachor with an increase in molecular size from 3 to 20 carbon atoms. Methane

and ethane appear to diverge slightly from this pattern. Some of this divergence is probably caused by the measurement of surface tension against air rather than its own vapor, and by the neglect of the vapor density.
A correlation suggested by Magaril7 relates the enthalpy of vaporization at constant pressure to the surface tension. Tables 2 and 3 and Figs. 2 and 3 express this relation for propane and for n-butane. The straight-line relationship on log-log paper appears to deviate slightly as the critical point is approached.
TWO-COMPONENT SYSTEMS
Prediction of interfacial tension in two-component systems is much more difficult than in the singlecomponent systems because of the added composition variable. The correlation suggested by Weinaug and Katz 8 has been used with the new exponent and slightly modified for use with molal volumes rather than specific gravity. The relation is

Xv X2 = mol fraction in the liquid phase, mol fraction in the vapor phase, molal volume, cu ft/lb mol, and new exponent of the parachor relation
11/3.
The modified values of the parachor together with the new exponent are used in this equation to predict values of interfacial tension determined experimentally 1 on the methane-normal pentane system and on the methane·normal decane system. These experimental data are summarized on the pressure·temperature plots in Figs. 4 and 5. The
boundaries of this region are the vapor-pressure curves for the pure components and the line of critical loci of the var ious intermediate mixtures. Superposed on these diagrams are the lines of constant interfacial tension. The known data for these iso-interfacial tension lines are the surface-tension data of the pure compounds and the experimental data by the aurhors, which include a very limited range in comparison to the complete two-phase region. Since the properties of the liquid and the gas at the critical point are identical, the line of

critical loci is also the line of zero interfacial tension; hence, the subsequent iso-interfacial tension lines must roughly parallel this boundary. These data and assumptions allow extrapolation and interpolation to all points within the two-phase region. It is evident from these plots that the interfacial tension of a binary mixture in the temperature range in which the critical pressure is high increases much more slowly with a decrease in pressure than either of the pure components. In the case of the methane-normal pentane system, a pressure drop of 450 psi from the critical pressure is required at lOOoF before the interfacial tension reaches 1 dyne/cm. The same increase for the pure components occurs with a pressure drop of about 120 psi. In the methane-normal decane system the effect is even more pronounced, the pressure drop at lOOoF being 1,040 psi for a comparable increase in interfacial tension. These facts suggest that interfacial forces may be negligible, as Jar as flow conditions

This calculation requires a knowledge of the composition of both phases and the molal volume or density of each phase. In the absence of density data, reduced temperature calculations may be used as an approximation to the density. The parachor numbers for each compound of the normal paraffin hydrocarbons from methane to n-eicosane are shown in Fig. 1.

Results of surface-excess calculations are given in Tables 5 and 6. As the pressure approaches zero, the value of the density term in the surfaceexcess equation approaches zero and the isothermal change in interfacial tension with pressure remains finite; hence, the surface excess as the pressure approaches zero also approaches zero. See Figs. 6 and 7. As the pressure approaches the critical point of the mixture, the density of methane remains finite; bur, according to experimental results, the change in interfacial rension with pressure approaches zero. Therefore, the surface excess again approaches zero as the critical pressure is approached. For intermediate values of pressure, the density term is positive and the slope was found to be negative; hence, the surface excess is positive between zero and the critical pressure, and has at least one

maximum point at some intermediate pressure. The occurrence of a maximum, followed by decreas-
ing values of surface excess, is attributed to the increased value of the surface excess of the heavier component. This value is probably small in the low-pressure region, bur it becomes large as the pressure becomes large. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the decrease in the "surface excess", as calculated, is the result of the surface excess of the heavier component's becoming significantly large. The maximum value of the calculated surface excess of the methane-normal pentane system (or the methane-normal decane system) might be associated with the attainment of a monolayer of methane on a solid surface, since extrapolation of these values for the various isotherms gives fairly good agreement of values of surface density l0 of a monolayer
of methane on a solid surface at -297°F. It appears that surface excess might be useful
as a correlating device for interfacial tension, since its values appear to be much more .constant for the various systems than interfacial tension itself. For instance, a plot of surface excess divided by density difference appears to give nearly a straight line when plotted against pressure and might possibly yield a finite value at the critical pressure, although in the case of the methane-normal pentane system the value appeared to approach zero very near the critical point.
Experimental datal have shown that not only the interfacial tension, but also the interfacial tension

divided by density difference approaches zero as the critical point is approached. The significance of the latter is emphasized by a calculation of wetting-phase saturation of porous media from interfacial-tension data. Plotting saturation gradient vs height, one obtains a very sharp gas-liquid contact as the critical point is approached.1 This sharp liquid-gas saturation gradient may be a contributing factor to the nonequilibrium conditions found in oil reservoirs by Cupps, Lipstate and Fry. 11
SUMMARY
A considerable amount of data has been accumulated on the surface tension of propane and normal butane, especially near their critical temperatures. In addition, the binary systems - methane-normal pentane and methane-normal decane - have been investigated tbroughour a wide pressure and temperature range, particularly in the region near the critical points. All these data point to the regularity of the pressure and temperature functions of surface and interfacial tension. Of most interest in the data, however, is the persistence of low interfacial tensions with relatively large changes in pressure in the region about the critical points. The importance of this fact to the petroleum engineer lies in its relationship to liquid saturations and flow behavior in an oil reservoir.
A means of predicting interfacial tension for hydrocarbon mixtures from composition and vol umetric data appears to fit experimental results very well. Other correlating devices such as reduced temperature relations, enthalpy of vaporization relations, and surface-excess calculations give promise of relating the surface phenomena to better known physical phenomena.
