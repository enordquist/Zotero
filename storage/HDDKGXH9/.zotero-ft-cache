Prediction of sequence-dependent and mutational effects on the aggregation of peptides and proteins
Ana-Maria Fernandez-Escamilla1, Frederic Rousseau2, Joost Schymkowitz2 & Luis Serrano1

We have developed a statistical mechanics algorithm, TANGO, to predict protein aggregation. TANGO is based on the physico-chemical principles of b-sheet formation, extended by the assumption that the core regions of an aggregate are fully buried. Our algorithm accurately predicts the aggregation of a data set of 179 peptides compiled from the literature as well as of a new set of 71 peptides derived from human diseaserelated proteins, including prion protein, lysozyme and b2-microglobulin. TANGO also correctly predicts pathogenic as well as protective mutations of the Alzheimer b-peptide, human lysozyme and transthyretin, and discriminates between b-sheet propensity and aggregation. Our results conﬁrm the model of intermolecular b-sheet formation as a widespread underlying mechanism of protein aggregation. Furthermore, the algorithm opens the door to a fully automated, sequence-based design strategy to improve the aggregation properties of proteins of scientiﬁc or industrial interest.
A growing body of experimental data has recently identiﬁed those residues within a protein sequence that promote ordered aggregation1–5 and amyloid formation3,6. On the basis of these observations, we have developed a statistical mechanics algorithm, TANGO, that identiﬁes the b-aggregating regions of a protein sequence. Our approach considers different competing conformations: b-turn, a-helix, b-sheet, the folded state and b-aggregates, and assumes that in b-aggregates the nucleating regions will be fully buried and tend to satisfy their hydrogen-bonding potential. TANGO takes into account protein stability and physico-chemical parameters such as pH, concentration, ionic strength and triﬂuorethanol (TFE) concentration. Every segment of a protein can populate each of the conformational states according to a Boltzmann distribution; that is, the frequency of the population of each structural state is relative to its energy, which is derived from statistical and empirical considerations. Therefore, to predict b-aggregating segments of a peptide, TANGO simply calculates the partition function of the conformational phase-space (see Methods).
We compared the output of the TANGO algorithm with data found in the literature on the aggregation of 179 peptides corresponding to sequence fragments of 21 different proteins (Fig. 1 shows results for 4 proteins; for more information see Supplementary Table 1 online).

We considered a peptide to be aggregating when the spectral property under investigation (mostly circular dichroism (CD) and NMR; Supplementary Table 1 online) revealed a concentration dependence or when binding to a b-aggregation-reporting dye (thioﬂavine T) was observed. Sixty-seven out of 179 peptides in our set were experimentally observed to aggregate in the concentration range between 1 mM and 5 mM, whereas the remaining peptides were monomeric in this range. For each residue in a peptide, TANGO computes the percent occupancy of the b-aggregation conformation. We considered peptides as having some aggregation tendency when they possessed segments of at least ﬁve consecutive residues populating the b-aggregated conformation.
We observed two regions of conﬁdence in our predictions. First, predictions for peptides with segments of ﬁve residues populating the aggregated state at more than 5% per residue were highly accurate, as only 9 of 62 predictions were false positives. Second, 52% of the predictions (12 out of 23) in the 0.2%–5% range were erroneous, suggesting that TANGO is unable to accurately predict low levels of aggregation propensity. However, TANGO yielded a success rate of 87%, correctly predicting 155 out of 179 peptides, with 21 false positives and 3 false negatives. This resulted in a correlation of 0.74 with a P value of 10–12. When we excluded predictions within the 0.2%–5% range, the success rate rose to 92% (142 out of 156 peptides predicted correctly) with only nine false positives (representing 15% of the predicted positives) and three false negatives (3% of the predicted negatives), resulting in a correlation of 0.83.
Our guideline of ﬁve consecutive residues with a TANGO score above 5% proved to be a good predictor of aggregation, independent of the size of the protein under study. It must be emphasized, however, that TANGO cannot in principle be used quantitatively to compare peptides or proteins differing widely in sequence. Quantitative comparison of aggregation propensities is only valid when comparing mutants of a common sequence measured under identical conditions, as discussed below for Alzheimer b-amyloid peptide, transthyretin and human lysozyme.
To better estimate the extent to which false predictions are due to inaccuracies of the algorithm or to experimental error, we measured an independent set of 71 peptides derived from human diseaserelated proteins (prion protein, lysozyme and b2-microglobulin) and also remeasured ﬁve peptides from the literature-derived set that were wrongly predicted. We measured all peptides by CD at

two concentrations, 50 mM and 1 mM, in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 25 1C (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1 online). The performance of TANGO on the new set of peptides was approximately the same as that observed on the data extracted from the literature. TANGO correctly predicted 65 of the 71 peptides of our data set (91%) giving a correlation of 0.70, in contrast to 0.74 for the literature set (without exclusion of the 0.2%– 5% range) (see Table 1a). Moreover TANGO turned out to correctly predict four out of the ﬁve peptides that were remeasured from the literature-derived set, suggesting that at least some of the false predictions were in fact due to experimental error.
b-sheet aggregation should not be confused with b-sheet propensity. Although the sequence requirements for both partly overlap, peptides with a high b-sheet propensity do not necessarily aggregate.

aData set drawn from the literature (179 peptides). bData set measured in the laboratory (71 peptides).

For example, peptide 55–64 from human lysozyme and peptide 77–86 from b-microglobulin are both part of a b-sheet in their respective crystal structures and have a high b-sheet propensity (Supplementary Table 2 online). However, the TANGO score of both peptides is near zero and the CD spectra of these peptides show no concentration dependence between 50 mM and 1 mM. Similar results were found for a series of peptides designed elsewhere to form b-hairpins7 and bsheets8. TANGO indicates that these peptides exhibit substantial secondary structures but do not aggregate; experimentally they were found to be monomeric at concentrations up to 1 mM.
TANGO incorporates four conformational states and different energy terms, taking into account hydrophobicity and solvation energetics, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Because aggregation has always been associated with hydrophobicity, it is conceivable that hydrophobicity and solvation terms alone are enough for accurate prediction. To assess the relative importance of the different terms included in our algorithm, we ran reduced versions of TANGO on our data set, comparing the contribution of the different elements to the accuracy of the predictions. In Table 1b we compare the overall prediction accuracy using partial sets in which A includes only hydrophobicity and b-sheet propensity, B adds electrostatic contributions, C adds hydrogen-bonding contributions, and the complete TANGO algorithm additionally takes into consideration the competition of a-helical and b-turn conformations with the aggregation process.
From Table 1 it is clear that all the contributions included in the aggregation model of TANGO are important for accurate prediction

of the aggregating sequences, leaving only a small number of false negative predictions (3% of predicted negatives are false negatives). In contrast, when only hydrophobicity and b-sheet propensity are used, 25% of the predicted negatives are false negatives. However, a small drawback is that the number of false positives increases slightly (25% for TANGO in comparison with 18% when considering hydrophobicity and b-sheet propensity alone).
Using TANGO we analyzed the aggregation propensities of wildtype Ab(1–40) and Ab(1–42) and several familial disease-related mutants of the Ab-peptide. The Ab(1–42) peptide is known to have a higher aggregation propensity and to be more toxic than Ab(1–40) (ref. 9). For both peptides, TANGO predicted two regions that participated in the aggregation process (Fig. 2a). The ﬁrst region, situated in the middle of the peptide and encompassing residues 17–21, was also the region associated with familial disease-related mutants, whereas the second C-terminal region consisted of residues 31–36 in the Ab(1–40) and of residues 30–42 in Ab(1–42). These regions corresponded to regions mapped by mutagenesis experiments10. Furthermore, TANGO predicted a strikingly higher aggregation propensity of Ab(1–42) over Ab(1–40): the additional isoleucine and alanine induced a much higher aggregation propensity by recruiting a bigger part of the C terminus into aggregation.
Finally, we predicted the change in aggregation propensity between wild type and four disease-related mutants, namely the Arctic (E22G), Dutch (E22Q), Italian (E22K) and Flemish (A21G) variants, and compared these with experimental measurements of the aggregation of the Ab-peptide in vivo11 (Fig. 2b). All variants had a higher aggregation propensity than the wild type, except the Flemish variant, which had a lower aggregation propensity, suggesting a more intricate mechanism for pathogenesis. TANGO correctly picked up the effect of the several mutations including the Flemish variant. The Italian

variant, however, was predicted to have no effect on the aggregation of the peptide, except at alkaline pH above the pKa of lysine 693.
As discussed above, TANGO accurately predicts the aggregation propensity in short peptides (95% of the peptides in the data set extracted from the literature are shorter than 25 residues). However, sequences longer than 30–40 residues can potentially introduce errors in the partition function because (i) long sequences are more likely to have more than two ordered sequences, (ii) coupling of the different ordered regions arising from tertiary interactions is also more common and (iii) intermediates in the aggregation process are likely to be present in higher proportions.
Despite the simplicity of the TANGO model for aggregation, we tested it on full-length proteins. TANGO predictions were compared with experimental measurements on the rate of aggregation of 33 mutants of acyl phosphatase3 (AcP). Figure 3 plots the ratio of mutant and wild-type aggregation rates at different positions along the sequence and compares them with the ratio of the TANGO scoring indexes. We found that TANGO predicts that the same regions are involved in aggregation as those observed experimentally. Moreover, TANGO can also predict whether the mutations increase or decrease aggregation. However, we would expect a better correlation between the amplitudes of the experimental and predicted changes in aggregation. We can think of several causes for this weak correlation. First, although AcP is in principle unfolded under the conditions of the experiment, there might still be residual structure and tertiary interactions complicating the picture. Second, although AcP is observed to aggregate via single exponential kinetics, the mechanism for aggregation of AcP might be more elaborate. CheY and suc1, which are both small globular proteins for which a simple aggregation behavior might be expected on the basis of the AcP data, aggregate by complex kinetics under similar conditions (data not shown). Finally, we compared experimental rates of aggregation with predictions for the amplitude of aggregation. Despite all these approximations, TANGO was able to pick up the aggregation pattern of unfolded proteins.
Predicting the aggregation tendencies of denatured proteins and peptides is relevant to the optimization of recombinant protein production. With regard to human disease, however, it is often more important to predict the aggregation effect of point mutations in folded proteins. To do this, we included the folded state in the TANGO partition function, thus allowing for competition between the folded state and the other structural states implemented in TANGO. This procedure allows detection of mutations that will increase the

In contrast to peptides and unfolded proteins, both stability and aggregation effects need to be
considered to detect pathogenic mutations in folded proteins. The T119M and V122I mutations in transthyrethin were reported to protect patients carrying common pathogenic mutations14–17,
such as V30G, from disease and are predicted to stabilize the protein as well as reduce

aggregation tendency of the denatured state, as discussed above, and also mutations that will increase the aggregation tendency of the protein by destabilizing the folded state. In human lysozyme and transthyretin, pathogenic mutations identiﬁed in patients12,13 were shown to be related to increased aggregation and changes in the stability of the proteins14–21. Mutations in the human lysozyme gene cause autosomal dominant hereditary amyloidosis13, whereas amyloid deposits of transthyretin are frequently found in patients suffering from familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy12. Apart from the pathogenic mutations that were identiﬁed for both proteins, mutations were also identiﬁed in transthyretin that protect patients from the devastating effect of certain disease-related mutations14,15. The free-energy change of unfolding upon mutation was calculated using the Fold-X force ﬁeld22 and correlated very well with the changes in midpoint of thermal denaturation reported in the literature17,21. Table 2 shows the predicted effect of pathogenic and protective mutation on stability (Fold-X) and aggregation (TANGO). TANGO correctly predicted the behavior of the mutants in the two proteins when both stability and aggregation effects were considered, reﬂecting the two scenarios outlined above by which mutations can cause increased aggregation in folded proteins. TANGO, in combination with the Fold-X force ﬁeld, is capable of predicting the effect of point mutations on the stability of proteins and can be used to identify mutations that cause increased aggregation and may hence lead to disease.

In conclusion, it is important to emphasize that TANGO predicts b-sheet aggregation and not amyloid formation. Although we found a good correlation between the aggregation tendency predicted by TANGO and the increase or decrease of amyloid formation in mutants of amyloidogenic peptides (Alzheimer peptides) and proteins (lysozyme and transthyretin), this does not mean that TANGO captures the speciﬁc sequence contribution for amyloid formation. Rather, it is probable that those peptides and proteins have amyloidogenic sequences and that b-sheet aggregation favors amyloidosis by promoting multimeric aggregated precursors.
METHODS For more details on the methods and the data sets used for the calibration and testing of the algorithm, please refer to Supplementary Notes 1 and 2 online.
The TANGO model for protein aggregation. The model used by the TANGO algorithm is designed to predict b-aggregation in peptides and proteins and consists of a phase-space encompassing the random coil and the native conformations as well as other major conformational states, namely b-turn, a-helix and b-aggregate. Every segment of a peptide can populate each of these states according to a Boltzmann distribution. Therefore, to predict b-aggregating segments of a peptide, TANGO simply calculates the partition function of the phase-space.
a-helical propensities. The parameters used in the latest version of AGADIR (AGADIR-1s23) have been used to determine the helical propensity of the amino acid sequences. The only modiﬁcation has been the implementation of a two-window approximation (see Supplementary Note 2 online).
b-turn propensities. b-turn propensity is calculated by considering three energy contributions (see Supplementary Note 2 online): (i) an amino-acid speciﬁc cost in conformational entropy for ﬁxing that residue in a b-turn compatible conformation, (ii) interactions of each amino acid with the turn structure in a position-dependent manner and (iii) a single H-bond between the main chains of residues i and i + 3 of the turn. We have considered only four types of turns for which we could obtain signiﬁcant statistical data, types I, I¢, II and II¢.
b-sheet aggregation. To estimate the aggregation tendency of a particular amino acid sequence, we have made the following assumptions: (i) In an ordered b-sheet aggregate, the main secondary structure is the b-strand. (ii) The regions involved in the aggregation process are fully buried, thus paying full solvation costs and gains, full entropy and optimizing their H-bond potential (that is, the number of H-bonds made in the aggregate is related to the number of donor groups that are compensated by acceptors. An excess of donors or acceptors remains unsatisﬁed). (iii) Complementary charges in the selected window establish favorable electrostatic interactions, and overall net charge of the peptide inside but also outside the window disfavors aggregation.
The effect of physico-chemical conditions on aggregation. The effect of pH, temperature and ionic strength on electrostatic interactions was taken into account as described in AGADIR2-1s23. Similarly the dependence of entropy, H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions on temperature and ionic strength are taken into consideration as described in AGADIR2-1s23.
TFE dependence. The effect of TFE on the stability of the different structural conformations considered here has been taken into consideration in the following way. First, we assume a general increase of the H-bond contribution to the energies of the helical, turn and aggregated conformations24. Second, we consider a change in the helical propensities of the amino acids based on published experimental results25. We assume that the effect of TFE is linear with concentration up to 40% where no further changes are considered. This is based on the empirical observation that for many peptides analyzed experimentally above 40% there are few, if any, changes (49).
Assumptions. We have opted for a two-window sampling approximation that assumes that the probability of ﬁnding more than two ordered segments in the

same polypeptide chain is too low to be considered (the simple one-window sampling will deviate too much from reality for peptides with 450 residues). Further, we assume there is no energetic coupling between the two windows. Finally, we do not consider aggregation intermediates. This means that we consider aggregates as a single molecular species or structural state in competition with the folded protein, the b-turn and a-helical conformations (see Methods). We do not consider b-hairpins as aggregating motifs, as no satisfactory method exists to predict b-hairpin stability.

Deﬁnition of and criteria for aggregation. The aggregation behavior of the peptides shown in Supplementary Table 1 online was taken from a range of publications, mostly reporting CD and NMR studies on these proteins. Aggregation was mainly judged from the protein concentration dependence of CD or NMR signals in a range of 50 mM to 5 mM. When concentration dependence was reported in the range studied, we assigned the peptide in question to the aggregation group. Alternatively, for some peptides, aggregation was measured by ﬂuorescence using thioﬂavine S or T that speciﬁcally bind to b-aggregates26.

CD spectroscopy of peptides. All measurements were performed in a Jasco spectropolarimeter using peptides purchased from Jerini GmbH (peptides were synthesized using the Pepspot technology).

Statistical evaluation of the performance of the prediction. To evaluate the correlation between our predictions and the experimental results, we used the Mathews correlation coefﬁcient27, which takes into account the number of true positives (tp), true negatives (tn), false positives (fp) and false negatives (fn) of the prediction, and can be calculated as follows:
corrMathews ¼ pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃðﬃﬃtﬃpﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃÃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃtﬃﬃnﬃﬃÞﬃﬃﬃÀﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃðﬃﬃfﬃpﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃÃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃfﬃnﬃﬃﬃÞﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ðtn + fnÞðtn + fpÞðtp + fnÞðtp + fpÞ

To estimate the probability that the correlation between our predictions and the experimental results would occur by change, we calculated a so-called P value as follows: Let P(S) be the probability of a successful (S) prediction of the aggregation propensity of a randomly chosen peptide. Because we only distinguish between two possible outcomes, aggregation A or no aggregation A, we can express P(S) as

PðSÞ ¼ PðSjAÞ PðAÞ + PðSjAÞ PðAÞ;

where P(S|A) and P(S|A) are the probabilities of a successful prediction conditioned on whether the peptide actually aggregates or not. Let P(A) ¼ y be the fraction of aggregating peptides in the sample. If yp is the probability for predicting aggregation by guessing at random, the probability of success would be:

PðSÞ ¼ yp y + ð1 À ypÞð1 À yÞ

The best random strategy is obtained by maximizing P(S) with respect to yp. When y o 1/2, P(S) is maximized by choosing yp ¼ 0, implying P(S) ¼ 1 – y. Consequently, in a sample consisting of N peptides, the number of successful random predictions, X, will be a stochastic variable with a binomial distribution, X B b(N ; 1 – y). The relevant P value, p, for our results is obtained by computing the probability of obtaining the same or larger number of successful predictions, as obtained by TANGO, when a random prediction scheme is used instead. If NS denotes the actual number of successful predictions, we get
