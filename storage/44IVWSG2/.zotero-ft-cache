Data (i) had to have small variance (as gauged by reported SE) and (ii) had to be reported in units of kg of dry weight per plant. A total of 385 species are represented in the complete data set (including arborescent monocots, dicots, and conifers). Data for the intraspeciﬁc scaling of plant organ biomass were collected by B.J.E. primarily from the agricultural and forestry literature (25, 27, 28). 21. ML, MS, and MR were each computed for an average plant from each community or experimental manipulation with the quotient of total plant biomass per site or treatment and plant density. Model type II (reduced major axis) regression analyses were then used to determine scaling exponents and allometric constants (regression slopes and y intercepts designated as ␣RMA and ␤RMA, respectively), because functional rather than predictive relation were sought among variables that were

(A) At a constant CypA concentration of 0.43 mM, spectra were recorded at 0 mM (blue), 0.38 mM (orange), 1.01 mM (green), and 2.86 mM (red) substrate. The signal of R55 is progressively shifting upon addition of increasing amounts of substrate, indicating fast conformational exchange during catalysis. The observed chemical shifts are population-weighted averages of E and ES, and thus shift towards the position of the ES complex with increasing amounts of substrate. In contrast, the signal of V139 is not affected by catalysis.

exchange rates between these states are faster
than the difference in their frequencies, i.e., the
time scale of exchange falls in the range of 10Ϫ5 to 10Ϫ3 s. In the presence of substrate, at
least three different states of CypA exist in
equilibrium (Scheme 1). Exchange between
these will increase the value of R2 by an amount Rex above that observed in free CypA, provided that the nuclear spin experiences different
chemical shifts in at least two of the three states
(8). Direct measurements of R2 revealed that during catalysis CypA undergoes microsecond
conformational exchange in specific regions of
the protein. A significant increase in R2 was observed for 10 out of 160 backbone amide
nitrogens (26) (Figs. 2 and 3), which together
define a contiguous region in the structure (Fig.
3). The measured Rex for a particular amide does not necessarily indicate motion of that
amide itself. Rex can be caused by slow time scale motions of nearby atoms. Addition of
substrate induces only minor changes in pico-
to nanosecond dynamics, as evidenced by R1, ␩xy, and {1H}-15N NOE (27). Thus, measure-

ment of R2 identifies “hot spots” of micro- to millisecond dynamics associated with either or
both of the processes involved in catalysis:
binding and isomerization.
Can the microscopic reaction steps be sep-
arated? The minimal reaction scheme (Scheme
1) consists of three microscopic reaction steps:
binding of (i) cis and (ii) trans isomers and (iii)
the catalytic step of substrate isomerization on
the enzyme. We separated the effects of binding
and isomerization by monitoring changes in R2 as a function of substrate concentration. The
relative contributions to R2 from exchange due to binding and isomerization have different de-
pendencies on the total substrate concentration.
For most residues, R2 first increases and then decreases with the addition of substrate (Fig. 2,
D and E, and Fig. 4A). This pattern of maxi-
mum chemical exchange at intermediate sub-
strate concentrations—where E, EScis, and EStrans are all significantly populated—is diagnostic of a predominant effect due to binding (see
Eq. 1). In contrast, R2 increases monotonically with substrate concentration for R55 (28) (Figs.

CypA catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of the Phe-Pro peptide bond of the substrate used here with a turnover rate of several thousands per second (43, 46).

2B and 4B). This increase in R2 with a concomitant increase in populations of EScis and EStrans pinpoints a significant conformational ex-

change contribution to R2 from interconversion between EScis and EStrans.
Do the exchange dynamics observed for the
enzyme correspond to the microscopic catalytic

steps of substrate turnover? To shed light on

this fundamental question, we determined rate

constants for the conformational changes on the enzyme and compared them with rate constants of substrate interconversion. For residues that report only on binding, a simple two-state ex-

change model (including the free and a single

bound state) can be applied, enabling the use of

closed analytical formulae to determine the
binding constant, off-rate, and chemical shifts.
The exchange contribution (Rex) to R2 may be approximated as (29):

where [SF] is a function of KDobs and the total concentrations of substrate and enzyme, koff is the off-rate, and kon is the on-rate (30). Hence, KDobs, koff, and ␦␻ can be estimated by nonlinear regression (31). The data for residues K82, L98, N102, and A103 are fit well by the two-state model, yielding values of KDobs between 0.95 and 1.20 mM, and values of koff between 10,700 and 14,800 s-1 (Fig. 4A). These values agree within uncertainties with those measured from line shape analysis of the substrate (32). Next, we obtained quantitative estimates of the rate constants of protein dynamics by simulating the R2 rates for the full three-state model of Scheme 1. Excellent agreement between the simulated and experimental data was obtained with the use of the rate constants of cis/trans isomerization determined separately from line shape analysis (32) together with reasonable chemical shift differences between the three states (33) (Fig. 4). The results confirm the qualitative evaluation of R2 outlined above: for

most residues the binding processes dominate the exchange contribution, whereas for others a contribution from the isomerization step is required to yield satisfactory fits.
The backbone amide nitrogen of R55 clearly experiences conformational exchange associated with the isomerization and binding process. Because the backbone amide group is distant from the substrate binding site, it is unlikely that the observed exchange merely reflects a conformational change of the bound peptide in a rigid active site. Rather, the results provide evidence for conformational fluctuations in the enzyme. Notably, R55 is essential for catalysis (34). Its side-chain guanidino group is hydrogen bonded to the prolyl nitrogen of the substrate, and, thus, promotes isomerization by weakening the double-bond character of that peptide bond (20, 21, 23, 34). The good agreement between the 15N relaxation results and those from substrate line enzyme shape analysis implies that the observed conformational dynamics of the enzyme are strongly and quantitatively correlated with the chemical steps of substrate interconversion. Furthermore, the conformational fluctuations of the enzyme are likely to be collective motions, because

similar rate constants were inferred for several backbone amides.
Interpretation of the results in light of structural data provides additional insights into CypA catalysis. We focus here on residues that show conformational exchange dynamics only during catalysis, thus excluding the loop from residues 68 –77 that also undergoes conformational exchange in resting CypA (35). Several residues (101–103 and 109) with catalysislinked exchange are physically close to the substrate bound in cis (Fig. 3A) (36). However, L98 and S99 are distant from the peptide in the cis conformation, yet undergo exchange during the catalytic cycle and show chemical shift changes upon titration with substrate that are comparable to those observed for residues 101– 103 and 109 (Figs. 1 and 3). Though the structure of the enzyme in complex with the corresponding trans isomer of the peptide is not known, our results suggest that L98 and S99 may be interacting with the trans peptide. Thus, we propose a reaction trajectory that involves a rotation of the COOH-terminal peptide segment around the prolyl peptide bond while the NH2terminal part remains bound to the enzyme (37). This conformational rearrangement brings

CypA residues with chemical exchange in both the presence and absence of substrate are color coded in blue (F67, N71, G74, S77, and S110). Residues in red exhibit chemical exchange only during turnover (R55, K82, L98, S99, A101, N102, A103, and G109). Residues shown in magenta exhibit chemical exchange in the absence of substrate, but increase in its presence ( T68 and G72). (B) Suggested trajectory of the enzymatic pathway based on the dynamics results. CypA catalyzes prolyl isomerization by rotating the part COOH-terminal to the prolyl peptide bond by 180° to produce the trans conformation of the substrate. In this model, the observed exchange dynamics for residues in strand 5 can be explained.

all residues exhibiting exchange, except R55, T68, and K82, into close proximity with the peptide (Fig. 3B). K82 is located within a loop remote from the active site (21). Our relaxation data clearly indicate the involvement of K82 in substrate binding, as confirmed by a reduction in substrate affinity for the mutant Lys82 3 Ala82 (K82A) (38). As shown in Fig. 1B, additional backbone amides show chemical shift changes during turnover. However, these changes are smaller than those observed for the aforementioned residues; hence, their exchange contribution to R2 is below the present detection limit (Eq. 1).
Taking all results together, we can envision the enzymatic cycle of CypA as follows (Scheme 1 and Fig. 3): the substrate exists in the cis and trans conformations free in solution. Both isomers can bind to CypA. For the cis isomer, the areas around 101–103, 109, 82, and 55 are important in the binding process, which is close to diffusion-controlled. After binding, the enzyme catalyzes a rotation of the prolyl peptide bond by 180°. For this to occur, the substrate tail COOH-terminal to proline likely swings around to contact the area around residues 98 and 99 (Fig. 3), whereas the NH2-terminal tail of the substrate stays fixed. In other words, the enzyme holds on to the substrate through this binding interaction. The isomerization step takes place with a rate constant of about 9000 s-1, and motions of the protein coincide with the rate of substrate rotation. The major player in catalysis is R55, for which the observed changes in backbone conformation are likely to be coupled with motions of the catalytically essential side chain. After the isomerization step, the enzyme releases the substrate, which is now in trans, with a rate constant of about 13,000 s-1.
The approach outlined here allows the identification of the dynamic “hot spots” during catalysis and reveals that the time scales of protein dynamics coincide with that of substrate turnover. However, it does not provide a detailed physical picture of the motions during catalysis. To do this, side-chain dynamics need to be included and, ultimately, all the relaxation data need to be used in molecular dynamics calculations. The application of relaxation measurements during substrate turnover promises to be of general use in understanding the dynamic behavior of enzymes and its relation to catalysis.

was a generous gift from W. Sundquist. CypA was

expressed in BL21/DE3 cells in 15N-labeled minimal

media. Cells were lysed in 25 mM MES, pH 6.1 and 5

mM ␤-mercaptoethanol and were puriﬁed on a S-

Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer.

Remaining DNA was removed on a Q-Sepharose

column with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.8 and 5 mM ␤-mer-

CypA in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 3

mM dithiothreitol (DT T), 10% D2O, with peptide concentrations between 0.04 and 2.6 mM. CypA re-

tained full activity during NMR data collection as

determined by the coupled chymotrypsin assay (39),

performed on samples before and after each series of

relaxation experiments.

25. Spectra were collected on Varian INOVA 600 spec-

trometers (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) at 25 Ϯ 0.1°C.

1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation

(HSQC) spectra were acquired with the use of WA-

TERGATE (40). 15N R1, R2, {1H}-15N NOE, and ␩xy experiments were performed using pulse sequences

reported previously (41, 42). For each sample, at least

seven R1 delays and eight R2 delays were acquired, ranging from 100 to 1000 ms and from 10 to 150 ms,

respectively. At least four relaxation delays were

acquired for the ␩xy measurement, ranging from 30 to 120 ms. Spectra were acquired with 2048 and 128

complex points in the 1H and 15N dimensions, re-

spectively. Processing and analysis of the NMR spec-

tra were performed with the use of Felix (Accelrys,

San Diego, CA ). Uncertainties in peak heights were

estimated from duplicate spectra. Relaxation rates

were determined using the program CurveFit (A. G.

Palmer).

26. Additional residues show signs of exchange if the

CPMG pulse train is substituted for a single refocus-

27. With addition of the peptide, several residues, includ-

ing residues N102 and A103, exhibit a decrease in R1, whereas no signiﬁcant change is observed for the

{1H}-15N NOE (see the supplementary material for

the complete R1 and {1H}-15N NOE data, available on Science Online at www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/

full/295/5559/1520/DC1). Thus, for these residues,

pico- to nanosecond motions are more restricted in

the presence of peptide. A reduction in mobility on

this time scale has also been observed for residues

101–104 in the presence of the inhibitor cyclosporin

A (35).

(Scheme 1) were integrated numerically with the use

of Mathematica 4.0 ( Wolfram Research, Champaign,

IL), and monoexponential decays were ﬁtted to the

resulting data sets, yielding transverse relaxation

rates for each residue at each concentration of sub-

strate. The three-state system is underdetermined by

the present number of experimental data points.

However, starting from parameter values determined

separately from line shape analysis of the substrate

during catalysis and from the two-site ﬁtting, a sen-

sitivity analysis of the parameter space yields ranges

of possible values for the rate constants. The chem-

ical shift differences between the three states were

adjusted but kept within a reasonable range. The

chemical shift differences between the free and

bound states are related to the maximum chemical

shift change (␦␻) observed upon substrate addition

and were determined separately by: ␦␻ ϭ ␦␻ct/(1 ϩ

Keq) – ␦␻Et. Keq ϭ [EScis]/[EStrans] is obtained from line shape analysis, ␦␻ct is the chemical shift difference between EScis and EStrans, and ␦␻Et is the chemical shift difference between E and EStrans. 34. L.

An initial structural model of CypA in complex with Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-4-NA was built from the crystal structure of CypA in complex with the similar peptide Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-NA in the cis conformation (PDB entry 1RMH) (21). All structures were viewed and built using MOLMOL (45). 37. Chemical shift changes for this substrate upon binding to cyclophilin have previously been calculated by line shape analysis, and these data also support the proposed model for the conformational change (43). 38.

Role of Nucleoporin Induction in Releasing an mRNA Nuclear
Export Block

Jost Enninga,1 David E. Levy,2 Gu¨nter Blobel,1* Beatriz M. A. Fontoura1,3

Signal-mediated nuclear import and export proceed through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Some NPC components, such as the nucleoporins (Nups) Nup98 and Nup96, are also associated with the nuclear interior. Nup98 is a target of the vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) matrix (M) protein–mediated inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA) nuclear export. Here, Nup98 and Nup96 were found to be up-regulated by interferon (IFN). M protein–mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear export was reversed when cells were treated with IFN-␥ or transfected with a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding Nup98 and Nup96. Thus, increased Nup98 and Nup96 expression constitutes an IFN-mediated mechanism that reverses M protein–mediated inhibition of gene expression.

The Nup98 and Nup96 proteins are encoded by a single gene. The primary transcript is alternatively spliced, and the translation products are autocatalytically proteolyzed at one specific site (1–3). Nup98 interacts with an intranuclear protein (4) and transport factors (5, 6). It is involved in nuclear import and export of proteins and RNAs (7–11) and is the target of the VSV M protein–mediated

inhibition of mRNA export (12). A cDNA clone coding for part of the COOH-terminal sequence of Nup96 has been detected among mRNAs that were specifically induced by IFN-␥ (13).
We found two classical elements, GAS and ISRE, that mediate increased gene expression by IFN (14, 15). When U937 cells were incubated with IFN-␥ for up to 12
