The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)’ of eukaryotic cells contains a single member of the 70-kDa heat shock (HSP70) protein family (reviewed in Ref. 2). This protein, now named BiP, was originally described independently as the immunoglobulin heavychain binding protein (3,4) and as th7e8-kDa glucose-regulatedprotein, grp78 (5). BiP is a major constituent of the lumen of the ER, and its rateof synthesis can be further increased by the accumulation of secretory precursors (6, 7) or mutant proteins (8,9) in the ER, or by a variety of stress conditions (reviewed in Ref. 10) that also lead to the accumulation in the ER of unfolded polypeptides (6, 8). In the ERof mammalian cells, BiP associates transiently with a

exists in interconvertible oligomeric and monomeric forms (32, 33). Because the post-translational modifications appear to be restricted to oligomeric forms of BiP that arenot bound to nascent polypeptides, Freiden et al. (34) proposed that the various forms of the protein arefunctionally distinct with the monomeric, unmodified form being the biologically active species able to bind to unfolded or unassembled proteins. However, the experiments described inthispaper demonstratethat synthetic peptides that stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP bindto both oligomeric and monomeric forms of BiP and thereby induce their conversion to enzymatically active, monomeric species.

variety of nascent, wild-type polypeptides (11-14) and more permanently with misfolded, underglycosylated or unassembled polypeptides whose transport from the ER is blocked (15-18). In Saccharomyces cereuisiae, BiP is involved in protein folding and assembly in the ER (19) and in addition is required for translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides

bBiP consists of monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher molecular weight oligomers whose ratios vary somewhat under different experimental conditions (compare lane 1 in Fig. 3, a, b, and c ) . In addition to each major species, minor, more slowly migrating species werealso observed (best seen in Fig. 3a, lane 1). Although we have not attempted to identify the cause of this heterogeneity in the electrophoretic mobilities of the monomeric and oligomeric forms of bBiP, it is likely that thevarious species differ in their extentof post-translational modification by phosphorylation and/or ADP-ribosylation (30-32,34). rBiP was predominantly present as monomers, with a small proportion of dimeric species (Fig. 3a, lane 2, and Fig. 3d, lanes 1 and 3).The rBiP monomers comigrate with a minor species of monomeric bBiP, whose mobility is significantly slower than that of the major monomeric bBiP species. Since bBiP and rBiPmigrate identically as single 78kDa specieson SDS-PAGE (data notshown), the differences in migration between the major bBiP and rBiP species are probably the result of post-translational modification of the majority of the bBiP molecules. Lack of extensive modification of rBiP produced in E. coli was previouslydemonstrated by two-dimensional PAGE of recombinant hamsterBiP (grp78) (33).However, rBiP monomers show somemicroheterogeneity, perhaps due to a limited degree of phosphorylation, which has been reported for the E. coli HSP70 protein, DnaK (41).
We investigated the effect of peptides on thestate of oligomerization of bBiPand rBiP. Addition of peptide A induced the dissociation of all oligomeric forms of bBiP and the conversion of the various monomeric forms into a single species (Fig.3b, lanes 1-3).This effect was dependent on the concentration of the peptide, being incomplete at a concen-
tration (0.12 mM) below the K,,(,0.67 mM) for stimulation of

the ATPase activity of bBiP (see above) but complete at a concentration (2.5 mM) above that required formaximal stimulation (Fig. 2). Peptide A also induced a decrease in the mobility of rBiP monomers which, a t decreased loading and in the absence of peptide, migrated as a triplet in which the three closelyspaced bands are presenint about equal amounts (Fig. 3b, lane 4 ) . In thepresence of peptide A, the slowerband of the triplet was significantly enriched (Fig. 3b, lane 6 ) .The slight mobility change may reflect the small increment in mass of the complex and/or a conformational change in the monomer induced by the binding of the peptide. These effects are not unique to peptide A since they were also observed with peptide PP52 (YIDRF!GE), identified as a BiPbinding sequence by panning of a library of peptides displayed on bacteriophage fd particles3 (Fig. 3c, lane 3; Fig. 3d, lanes 2 and 4 ; and Fig. 4a, lane 2), and with peptide P17G

meric species (which predominate inthe recombinant protein purified from E. coli) display maximal activity, while the various oligomeric species (which form a significant proportion of bovine BiP) areless active or inactive. The ability of some peptides to stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP in

Peptides ConvertInactive BiP Oligomers to Active Monomers

FIG.5. A model illustrating proposed pathways of interconversion of oligomeric and monomeric speciesof BiP. Counterclockwise from top: in quiescent, unstressed cells the majority of BiP molecules is present as oligomeric species that are post-translationally modified by phosphorylation and/or ADP ribosylation (30-32, 34). Conditions that result in an increase in the concentration of unfolded polypeptides in the ER promote the reversal of modifications and thedissociation of BiP oligomers (30,34).Our data demonstrate that both the oligomeric and monomeric species are capable of binding peptides and thatpeptide-induced stimulation of BiP's ATPase activity reflects the conversion of inactive or less active oligomers into active monomers. Hydrolysis of ATP by BiP thenpromotes release of the (po1y)peptide from the complex (28, 29). In thecontinued presence of unfolded polypeptides and ATP, cycles of polypeptide binding, ATP hydrolysis, and polypeptide release continue. When the concentration of unfolded polypeptides in the ERdecreases, free BiP molecules becomemodified and oligomer formation is favored.

proteins,' suggesting that peptide-induced dissociation of oligomeric forms of proteins of the HSP70 family is a general phenomenon. A model illustrating proposed pathways of interconversion of the various forms of BiP (or other HSP70 family members) that is compatible with our observations and with published data (28-34) is shown in Fig. 5.
An important feature of the model is that changes in the steady state levels of unfolded polypeptides in the ER affect the degree of post-translational modification of BiP, which in turn alters the propensity of BiP tooligomerize. Mammalian BiP exists in vivo as an apparently interconvertible mixture of post-translationally modified oligomers and unmodified monomers, whose proportions vary with the physiological state of the cell (34). Conditions that increase the levels of unfolded polypeptides in the ERcause a decrease in the extent of modification and an increase in the proportion of monomeric species (30, 34). Only unmodified, monomeric BiP molecules werefound in complexeswith unfolded or unassembled polypeptides (32, 34). Our in uitro results are consistent with these findings, since at 37 "C synthetic peptides that bind BiP cause the conversion of a complex mixture of oligomeric and monomeric BiP species to a single monomeric form. However, our resultsdo not supportthe suggestion that only the monomeric species is active in complexing other proteins (34),since we have shown that biotinylated peptides bind to both monomeric and oligomeric forms of BiP. Taken together, the available data suggest that oligomeric and modified forms of BiP represent an inactive storage pool of the chaperone, which can be rapidly mobilized in thepresence of an increased level of unfolded polypeptides in the lumen of the ER. Because the rate of de nouo synthesis of BiP is also

increased in response tothe accumulation in theER of unfolded polypeptides (6,8,9,43),the size of the storage pool may be monitored via sensing of the degree of modification of BiP molecules (34).Thus theproximal signal for induction of transcription of BiP mRNA in the nucleus maybe the disappearance of modified and/or oligomeric forms of BiP in the ER (44). Work is in progress to understand the relationship between post-translational modification of BiP, its state of oligomerization, and the regulation of its activity in uiuo and in uitro.
