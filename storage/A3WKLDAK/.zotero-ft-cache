[4] Protein Structure Prediction Using Rosetta
By Carol A. Rohl, Charlie E. M. Strauss, Kira M. S. Misura, and David Baker
Introduction
Double-blind assessments of protein structure prediction methods, held biannually in the community-wide critical assessment of structure prediction (CASP) experiments, have documented signiﬁcant progress in the ﬁeld of protein structure prediction and have indicated that the Rosetta algorithm is perhaps the most successful current method for de novo protein structure prediction.1–3 In the Rosetta method, short fragments of known proteins are assembled by a Monte Carlo strategy to yield native-like protein conformations. Using only sequence information, successful Rosetta predictions yield models with typical accuracies of 3–6 A˚ C root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the experimentally determined structures for contiguous segments of 60 or more residues. In such low- to moderateaccuracy models of protein structure, the global topology is correctly predicted, the architecture of secondary structure elements is generally correct, and functional residues are frequently clustered to an active site region. Models obtained by de novo prediction methods have been demonstrated to have utility for obtaining biological insight, either through

functional site recognition or functional annotation by fold identiﬁcation.4,5 The Rosetta method is sufﬁciently fast to make genome-scale analysis possible: a recent study predicted structures for %500 PfamA families with no link to known structure.6 On the basis of previous performance, one of the ﬁve models reported for each Pfam family is expected to be a reasonable match to the true structure for about 50–60% of the families, and many of these predictions suggest a homology unapparent in their sequences
Because of its success in de novo structure prediction, the Rosetta method has also been successfully extended to other protein-modeling problems including structure determination using limited experimental constraints,7,8 de novo protein design,9,10 protein–protein docking,11 and loop modeling.12 Structure determination by using Rosetta in combination with limited experimental constraints generally yields structures of higher overall accuracy, often with an RMSD of 2–3 A˚ over the entire protein. Loop modeling is carried out in the context of a homology-based template that is also frequently only %2 A˚ from the true structure. For design of novel protein structures, sequence selection algorithms require backbone structures of accuracy equivalent to experimentally determined X-ray crystal structures. To address these problems, as well as to reﬁne de novo models, improvements to the Rosetta method have focused on increased detail in the potential functions and ﬁner control of chain motion in the search algorithm.
Although de novo structure prediction with the Rosetta algorithm has been previously described, here we summarize the current method in its entirety. The beneﬁts and limitations of the fragment assembly strategy utilized by Rosetta are discussed, and we describe adaptations of the Rosetta method for structural modeling with ﬁner resolution. Enhancements to the fragment assembly strategy that allow more local modiﬁcations of protein conformation are described, and the effectiveness of

these operators for energy function minimization is illustrated. In addition, in Appendix I we derive a new, efﬁcient approach to screening local moves; that is, ﬁnding short sets of torsional angle changes that permit local changes in a protein chain while collectively minimizing global changes. Our formulation is computationally fast while offering better correlation to global distance changes appropriate to the atomic interaction potentials than previous popular methods (e.g., Gunn12a). The method is applicable to both the problem of screening discrete moves as well as allowing gradient descent of continuous multiangle moves.

Rosetta Strategy
A guiding principle of the Rosetta algorithm is to attempt to mimic the interplay of local and global interactions in determining protein structure. The method is based on the experimental observation that local sequence preferences bias but do not uniquely deﬁne the local structure of a protein. The ﬁnal native conformation is obtained when these ﬂuctuating local structures come together to yield a compact conformation with favorable nonlocal interactions, such as buried hydrophobic residues, paired  strands, and speciﬁc side-chain interactions. In the Rosetta algorithm, the structures sampled by local sequences are approximated by the distribution of structures seen for those short sequences and related sequences in known protein structures: a library of fragments that represent the range of accessible local structures for all short segments of the protein chain are selected from a database of known protein structures. Compact structures are then assembled by randomly combining these fragments, using a Monte Carlo simulated annealing search. The ﬁtness of individual conformations with respect to nonlocal interactions is evaluated on the basis of a scoring function derived from conformational statistics of known protein structures.
Rosetta utilizes a torsion space representation in which the protein backbone conformation is speciﬁed as a list of backbone , , and ! torsion angles. Conformation modiﬁcation occurs in torsion space, although for purposes of evaluating the energy of the conformation the corresponding Cartesian space protein representation is generated with atomic coordinates for all heavy atoms in the protein backbone, assuming ideal bond lengths and angles for individual residues.13 Two alternate representations of side chains are utilized depending on the requirements of the energy function in use (see below). For residue-based potential terms, a reduced

description is used in which each side chain is represented by a centroid located at the side-chain center of mass (C and beyond). For glycine, the centroid is coincident with the C atom. Centroid positions for each residue type are determined by averaging over observed side-chain conformations in known protein structures. For increased detail, atomic coordinates for all side-chain atoms, including hydrogens, are utilized. Side chains are restricted to discrete conformations as described by a backbone-dependent rotamer library.14 Side-chain conformations are added to the backbone structure by means of a Monte Carlo simulated annealing search.15
Derivation of the Rosetta scoring function or potential energy surface (PES) is based on a Bayesian separation of the total energy into components that describe the likelihood of a particular structure, independent of sequence, and those that describe the ﬁtness of the sequence given a particular structure.16,17 The terms in this scoring function in their current form are summarized in Table I. The original Rosetta scoring function uses a fairly coarse-grained or low-resolution description of structure: terms corresponding to solvation and electrostatic effects are based on observed residue distributions in protein structures. Hydrogen bonding is not described explicitly, but probabilistic descriptions of -strand pairing geometry and -sheet patterns are included. Steric overlap of backbone atoms and side-chain centroids is penalized, but favorable van der Waals interactions are modeled only by rewarding globally compact structures. The scoring function does not explicitly evaluate local interactions because these interactions are implicitly included in the fragment library (see below).
For applications requiring ﬁner resolution, more detailed descriptions of the determinants of protein structure are needed and have motivated the development of a more physically realistic, atomic-level potential function that attempts to model the primary contributions to stability and structural speciﬁcity (Table II). van der Waals interactions are modeled with a 6–12 Lennard–Jones potential, attenuated to a linear function in the repulsive regime to compensate for the discrete rotamer representation of side chains. Solvation effects are included, using the model of Lazaridis and Karplus,18 and hydrogen bonding is explicitly included, using a secondary structure- and orientation-dependent potential derived from analysis of hydrogen bond geometries in high-resolution protein structures.19–21

Electrostatics are modeled using a residue-based pair potential, similar to that utilized at low resolution. In addition, because ﬁner modiﬁcations of conformation permit introduction of angles not part of the original discrete fragment set (see below), energetic description of local interactions is included in the total energy, including an amino acid- and secondary structure-dependent torsion potential for the backbone dihedral angles.

De Novo Structure Prediction with Rosetta
Fragment Selection
The basic conformation modiﬁcation operation employed by Rosetta is termed a ‘‘fragment insertion.’’ For each fragment insertion, a consecutive window of three or nine residues is selected, and the torsion angles of these residues are replaced with the torsion angles obtained from a fragment of a protein of known structure. For each query sequence to be predicted, a customized library of fragments deﬁning the conformational space to be searched is selected by comparison of short windows of the query sequence with known protein structures. All three- and nine-residue windows in the query are scored against all windows in a nonredundant database of proteins of known structure composed of X-ray structures of 2.5 A˚ resolution or better and <50% sequence identity. All bond lengths and bond angles in these structures have been set to ideal values and the backbone torsion angles ﬁne tuned using small perturbations to maintain agreement with the X-ray-determined atomic coordinates, minimize steric overlap (Table I; vdw), and maintain favorable values of backbone torsion angles as evaluated by the torsion potential (Table II; rama).
Sequence proﬁles for the query sequence and each sequence in the structure database are constructed by two rounds of PSIBLAST24 with a cutoff of 9 Â 10À4. Over each sequence window, a proﬁle–proﬁle similarity score is calculated as the sum of the absolute value of the differences of the probabilities of each amino acid at each position (L1 norm, widely known as the city block or taxi cab distance). In addition, the predicted secondary structure of the query sequence is compared with the DSSP22-assigned secondary structure of the known structure in each sequence window. Currently, three secondary structure predictions are utilized: Psipred,25

SAM-T99,26 and JUFO.27 The similarity score for each secondary structure prediction is calculated as the negative sum of the three-state conﬁdence for the correct secondary structure type at each position in the sequence window. For each secondary structure prediction, the overall similarity score is the sum of the sequence similarity score and half the secondary structure similarity score. Fragments containing backbone torsion angles inconsistent with the torsional preferences of the residue types speciﬁed by the query sequence are also discarded (e.g., cis peptide bonds are allowed only at proline residues in the query sequence).
A ranked list of the top fragments in each sequence window is assembled iteratively, adding the top scoring fragment according to each secondary structure prediction to the combined ranked list and eliminating redundancies. Fragments selected according to Psipred secondary structure prediction are incorporated into the list with a threefold greater frequency than fragments selected on the basis of other secondary structure predictions. As this round robin assembly of the fragment list proceeds, the proportion of helix, strand, and other secondary structure types at each residue is balanced to be consistent with the average three-state prediction of all secondary structure predictions utilized, supplementing the ﬁnal list as needed with fragments with the desired secondary structure type at a particular position, ranked according to their agreement with the average secondary structure prediction and sequence proﬁle. The ﬁnal fragment list for a query sequence is composed of 200 nine-residue and 200 three-residue fragments for every overlapping insertion window in the query.

Fragment Assembly
The assembly of fragments into protein-like structures occurs by a Monte Carlo search. The search is arbitrarily started with the protein in a fully extended conformation. A 9-residue fragment insertion window is randomly selected and a fragment for this window is randomly selected from the top 25 fragments in the ranked list for this position. After replacing the torsion angles in the protein chain with the torsion angles from the selected fragment, the energy of the resulting conformation is evaluated. Moves that decrease the energy are retained; those that increase the energy are retained according to the Metropolis criterion. If no moves are accepted in 150 attempted insertions, the probability of accepting a move of increased energy is incrementally increased. After an accepted

move, the acceptance probability is returned to its initial value. Each simulation begins from a different random seed and attempts 28,000 nine-residue fragment insertions.
The complete scoring function used for de novo prediction is given in Table I. During the course of the simulated annealing protocol, terms are progressively added to the total potential. Initially, only the steric overlap term (Table I; vdw) is evaluated, and this stage continues until all initial torsion angles have been replaced. Over the next 2000 fragment insertion attempts, secondary structure is accumulated in the chain, and all terms except those rewarding compactness (Table I; cbeta, rg) are evaluated. The strand pairing score is evaluated according to Scheme A (Table I; SS) at 0.3 of its ﬁnal weight. For the next 20,000 attempted fragment insertions, the SS score is increased to its full weight, and the cbeta term is added at half its ﬁnal weight. During this stage of the simulation, the SS score alternates every 2000 cycles between encouraging local strand pairing and relaxing it. This relaxation in strand pairing requirements is accomplished by evaluating interactions only between residues separated by more than 10 residues in sequence. For the last 6000 attempted moves, strand pairing is encouraged, using the standard sequence separation cutoff of 5 residues (see Table I). For the ﬁnal 4000 attempted moves, the complete scoring function as described in Table I is utilized with all terms at their full weight. The SS score is evaluated according to Scheme B, using the 5-residue sequence separation cutoff. After the assembly of decoy structures from 9-residue fragments, each decoy is subjected to a short reﬁnement of 8000 attempted 3-residue fragment insertions of the ‘‘gunn’’ type (see below), using the complete scoring function.
For each structure prediction, many short simulations starting from different random seeds are carried out to generate an ensemble of ‘‘decoy’’ structures that have both favorable local interactions and protein-like global properties. This set is then clustered by structural similarity to identify the broadest free energy minima; the structure predictions for a sequence are generally the centers of the largest clusters.6 Examples of successful predictions made by means of this strategy at CASP 5 are shown in Fig. 1.

Structure Prediction by Fragment Assembly
The fragment assembly approach has multiple beneﬁts for de novo protein structure prediction. First, and foremost, the fragment library approximates Gibbs sampling of the populated regions of the local potential energy surface of the backbone. The Rosetta philosophy is that during the folding process of real proteins, the local structure ﬂuctuates between

alternative local conformations and each fragment is a likely conformation of the local sequence. The use of a preset library of low-energy local structures means the local interaction energy need not be explicitly calculated with each move. This simpliﬁcation is both efﬁcient and crucial; computing the interaction energy assumes that an accurate potential energy surface is known, which may not be possible. Fragments, on the other hand, allow an accurate, but implicit, representation of the potential energy surface for local interactions. In the Rosetta fragment move set, a single-fragment substitution moving the protein from one topological isomer to another is like instantly transporting from one local energy minimum on the local PES to another; something a more continuous molecular dynamics or gradient search algorithm would be hard pressed to mimic.
Having dispensed with the need for an accurate local PES, the remaining global PES in Rosetta can be coarse grained in distance, and discrete in the combinatorics of strand pairing (Table I). Such a potential is well suited to the large search space inherent in the folding problem, and

a second major advantage of the fragment insertion strategy is that it trades precise atomic positioning in favor of rapidly and coarsely sampling the large conformational space. Because fragment insertion modiﬁes a consecutive set of backbone torsion angles, the effect of a move is not localized as it would be with a Cartesian move: the orientation and displacement of atoms on either side of an insertion position can change dramatically as a result of a single backbone torsion angle rotation. Angular changes made in the insertion window are not continuous, but rather are selected from a discrete library. Multiple angles are changed simultaneously, and the original values of the torsion angles being changed are not considered when selecting the angles that will be used for the new move. Consequently, the angular changes from move to move can be quite dramatic, allowing the conformation to evolve rapidly and escape local minima.
The single-fragment insertion approach makes many global conformers dynamically inaccessible on the search trajectory. In effect, the space of accessible conformations is cut off and thereby dramatically reduced. Whether this effect is beneﬁcial depends only on whether the set of included conformations contains a close neighbor of the native protein conformer. The Rosetta philosophy has been shaped by empirical observations that the folding dynamics of protein domains (see e.g., Plaxco et al.28) are consistent with a process dominated by a quick quench: proteins may repeatedly quickly collapse from an extended chain to a compact structure and either unfold if the structure is distant from the native conformation or, in the rare case that the chain collapses to the native free energy basin, stay folded rather than sampling many energy basins while in a compact form. The ‘‘single move at a time’’ philosophy is not consistent with the physical fact that all the torsion angles are free to move simultaneously, but empirically and intuitively it does bias the ﬁnal set of accessible structures toward the set achievable by a rapid, unorchestrated collapse.

Enhancements of Fragment Insertion Strategy
For de novo fold prediction, the beneﬁts of fragment insertion allow rapid convergence on collapsed structures of plausible topology. Once this initial collapse has occurred, however, the fragment insertion strategy hinders efﬁcient model reﬁnement. Within a compact structure, any randomly selected, rigid body transformation of part of the chain is likely to create a clash with neighboring atoms or break favorable contacts. In

addition, once the structure is coarsely established, the scale of conformation modiﬁcation must be appropriate for optimizing more ﬁne-grained potentials. It is thus desirable to deﬁne conformation modiﬁcation operators for which the scale of global perturbation can be adjusted. Singlefragment insertion also lacks the notion that two or more consecutive moves taken together might offset the harmful effect of each other, yielding a net improvement. Each single insertion is rejected or accepted on the basis of the new energy of the entire conformation, and two moves can be coupled only indirectly via the Metropolis acceptance criteria: a move that increases the energy of the structure is on occasion accepted, setting the stage for a subsequent compensating move. Finally, the Monte Carlo fragment insertion strategy lacks the concept of using the gradient of the potential function to bias conformation modiﬁcations toward those that are more likely to be accepted.
For modeling scenarios requiring ﬁner sampling about compact structures such as loop modeling, model reﬁnement, and protein design, we have supplemented the original fragment insertion move set of Rosetta with additional conformation modiﬁcation operators. Five basic concepts are combined to generate these novel operators: (1) random torsion angle perturbation, (2) selection of globally nonperturbing fragments, (3) rapid torsion angle optimization to offset global backbone perturbations, (4) optimization of the scoring function by gradient descent after a backbone modiﬁcation (Monte Carlo plus minimization), and (5) rapid optimization of side-chain rotamers. In some of these operations, detailed below, deviations from backbone torsion angles of the fragment library are permitted, but such deviations are small so that the assumption that the fragment structures approximate low-energy local interactions is not violated.

Random Angle Perturbation
The simplest approach to local sampling about a compact structure is to perturb the torsion angles from their current values. We employ either small perturbations of randomly selected (, ) pairs (‘‘small’’) or perturbation of a randomly selected  angle coupled with a compensating rotation of equal magnitude but opposite direction of the preceding angle. The latter case effects a ‘‘shear’’ motion in which the intervening peptide plane is rotated with minimal perturbation to the rest of the chain. Modiﬁcation of residues in  helices is not allowed, and random perturbations have an upper limit of 2 for residues in  strands and 3 for all other residues. In addition, perturbations that increase the Ramachandran score (Table II; rama) are discriminated against, using a Metropolis criterion.

Selection of Globally Nonperturbing Fragments: A Local Move
The second approach retains reliance on fragment insertion, but biases fragment selection toward those that are most similar to the existing fragment in the model. Two different methods are used to estimate the similarity of two fragments. In the ‘‘chuck’’ strategy, the relative displacement of all the atoms in the protein on fragment replacement is measured, whereas in the ‘‘gunn’’ method, the net rotation and translation effected by different fragments are directly compared.
In the chuck method of fragment selection, the rigid body displacement of the downstream chain resulting from a fragment replacement is computed. The smaller the mean square deviation (MSD) of the atoms in the rigid body, the more the move is regarded as local. The MSD computation can be done extremely efﬁciently for a library of candidate fragments by relying on the fact that the differential rotation and translation need not be applied to every atom in order to compute the MSD, but only to the inertial ellipsoid of the rigid body (Appendix I). Further advantage is obtained by pretabulating the rotation and translation implied by every fragment in the discrete library. The library is winnowed to those fragments with a total downstream MSD change below a speciﬁed threshold, and a fragment in this set is then chosen at random for insertion.
In the gunn strategy, the rotation and translation effected by a fragment on the downstream portion of the chain are summarized by six degrees of freedom that are deﬁned such that they are independent of the absolute origin and orientation of the coordinate system. Consequently, two fragments with similar net rotations and translations will have six-parameter descriptions that are almost numerically equal. The parameterization originally described by Gunn12a is used, but the arbitrary cost function is chosen such that large parameter differences are attenuated more than smaller ones: in other words, a fragment with ﬁve closely matching parameters and one poor match is preferred over a fragment with six mediocre matches (Appendix II). The gunn cost is computed for each library fragment at the selected insertion window, and a random selection is made among fragments with costs lower than the speciﬁed threshold.

Torsion Angle Variation to Offset Global Perturbation
In the ‘‘wobble’’ operation, the global perturbation of a fragment insertion (or any initial conformation modiﬁcation) is offset by continuous variation of backbone (, ) angles within or adjacent to the insertion window. This operation is similar to the chuck strategy in that the MSD of downstream atoms is the measure of global perturbation. The wobble gradient descent is accelerated by analytic derivatives and, conveniently,

82

numerical computer methods

[4]

our choice of the downstream MSD is differentiable and efﬁciently computed (Appendix I). In addition to the MSD, the cost function for optimization includes the Ramachandran potential (Table II; rama) that is derived from a smoothed, highly ﬂattened version of the residue- and secondary structure-speciﬁc frequency with which a given (, ) pair occurs. The ﬂattening deliberately weakens discrimination in allowed (,
) regions so that the MSD term dominates the result. The smoothing erases local minima and creates gradients leading from low-frequency areas to allowed regions. The look-up table is linearly interpolated between adjacent bins, making the derivative analytic.
The wobble operation is typically combined with fragment insertion in order to generate a complete conformation modiﬁcation operator. In the standard combination, a fragment is selected by the chuck method, using an MSD cutoff of 60 A˚ 2. Subsequently, the torsion angles of a residue at the edge of the insertion window are modiﬁed by a wobble operation (wobble move in Fig. 3). Multiple fragment insertions and wobble operations can also be combined to generate more complex modiﬁcation operators. The ‘‘crank’’ move in Fig. 2 is one such example. The move is initiated by making a chuck insertion at a selected insertion window. Torsion angles of an adjacent residue are then perturbed, using the wobble operation. Finally, at a second site not adjacent to the insertion window, torsion angles of two additional residues are perturbed by a second wobble operation. This type of move also attempts to select insertion windows where perturbations are more likely to be tolerated, biasing selection to residues not part of regular secondary structure elements. We note that the chuck methodology can be easily extended to double-fragment insertions, although in practice we ﬁnd such operations inefﬁcient and prefer to combine chuck insertions with wobble operations.

Monte Carlo Plus Minimization
Finally, any of the above described operations can be combined with direct optimization of the Rosetta potential energy function, replacing the Monte Carlo search strategy with the Monte Carlo-plus-minimization strategy described by Li and Scheraga.29 After application of the initial modiﬁcation, we attempt to rescue conformations with slightly increased energy by gradient descent to a local minimum. Either a single line minimization is carried out along the initial gradient (‘‘lin’’; Fig. 3) or an iterative descent to the local minimum is employed, using the variable metric method of Davidon, Fletcher, and Powell (‘‘dfp’’; Fig. 3).30 In either case,

(, ) torsion angles within ﬁve residues of the site(s) of initial perturbation are varied. Torsion angles that are part of helical segments are held ﬁxed. After minimization of the potential function, moves are accepted according to the usual energy criteria.

Rapid Side-Chain Optimization
The methods described above implement modiﬁcations of the backbone torsion angles and are combined in a variety of ways to generate backbone conformation modiﬁcations. In addition to modifying backbone conformation, operators must also allow for changes in side-chain conformation. Using a simulated annealing protocol, side-chain rotamers can be completely reoptimized.15 In combination with operators that modify the backbone conformation, however, side-chain rotamers are rapidly optimized by cycling through each side-chain position in random order and replacing the current rotamer with the lowest energy rotamer available at that position. Combining both backbone and side-chain modiﬁcation, complete conformation modiﬁcation operators follow this general progression of steps: (1) initial backbone modiﬁcation, either by random angle perturbation or selection of a globally nonperturbing fragment, (2) wobble of selected torsion angles to offset the global perturbation caused by the

Moves are named according to the type of perturbation made and the number of residues in the original perturbation (see text for details): small, random perturbation of one or more nonconsecutive (, ) pairs; shear, random compensating changes in a  angle and the preceding angle; wobble, insertion of a chuck fragment followed by a wobble of one residue; crank, insertion of a chuck fragment followed by a wobble of one residue adjacent to the insertion window and then by a wobble of two residues nonadjacent to the insertion window (illustrated in Fig. 2); frag, unmodified fragment insertion; gunn, insertion of a fragment selected using the gunn strategy.

Addition of dfp indicates the move is followed by variable metric optimization of the potential function before evaluation of the Metropolis criterion.

initial modiﬁcation, (3) rapid optimization of side-chain rotamers, and (4) optimization of the scoring function by gradient descent.

Effectiveness of Conformation Modification Operators for Energy Function Optimization
Modiﬁed fragment insertions of the gunn type have been incorporated into the de novo prediction protocol, as described above, and permit signiﬁcant optimization of the scoring function that is often accompanied by improvements in decoy accuracy and/or discrimination of near-native decoys.31 When the Rosetta strategy is combined with structural constraints, experimentally determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the incorporation of the modiﬁed moves described here is essential for reﬁning initial decoy conformations generated by fragment assembly.7,8 Experimental constraints provide an unusually effective scoring function for identifying accurate structures, and optimization of the agreement between the experimental data and the model structure nearly always results in models of increased accuracy.
To more generally evaluate the effectiveness of the modiﬁed move sets described here, we applied each move in isolation to a small test set of model structures and evaluated the frequency with which moves were accepted and the overall ability of each move type to optimize the value of the all-atom energy function (Table II). Most of the modiﬁed move sets evaluated here involve perturbation of backbone torsion angles to values not described by the original fragment set, necessitating the inclusion of the torsion potential term (Table II; rama) to describe local interactions. In addition, all terms in the all-atom function are differentiable as binned terms are linearly interpolated.
The test set consisted of eight models generated by Rosetta for each of seven small proteins. These models were generated by the standard de novo protocol (see above). The backbones were subjected to a short relaxation protocol to remove steric clashes (using the high-res radii set for the vdw term; see Table I), and then side chains were added to the decoys by means of a simulated annealing repacking algorithm.15 For each decoy, a total of 200 times the number of residues in the sequence moves was attempted for each move type or combination of move types. During the course of the attempted backbone moves, side chains were completely reoptimized, using the simulated annealing protocol. Five independent simulations were performed for each move type for each decoy. Simulations in which the ﬁnal model differed from the starting structure by more than 4 A˚ C RMSD

were discarded, and the simulation resulting in the lowest energy model was selected for analysis.
Figure 3 illustrates the relative effectiveness of each move type for optimizing the all-atom energy function. For each starting decoy in the test set, the energies of the lowest energy decoy obtained from application of each move type were sorted from highest energy (1) to lowest (30). The average rank over all decoys for each move type is reported in Fig. 3A. The fraction of attempted moves accepted for each move type is reported in Fig. 3B, and Fig. 3C reports the frequency of simulations that resulted in expanded structures. As expected, moves that cause smaller global perturbations (small, shear) are generally accepted with higher frequency than more globally perturbing moves. The critical conclusion is that most of the modiﬁed fragment insertion move types, although not accepted with high frequency, are signiﬁcantly more effective than standard fragment insertions in optimizing the cost function, and are less likely to result in expanded protein conformations. Addition of the Monte Carlo-plusminimization strategy increases the efﬁcacy of the moves as well. Furthermore, application of the most effective moves in combination further increases both the acceptance rate and the extent of optimization of the cost function (see combination 1 and combination 2 in Fig. 3).

Conclusions
Although any protein-modeling strategy must attempt to ﬁnd an optimal tradeoff between cost of computation of each move and the effectiveness of modiﬁcations in optimizing a cost function, the optimal tradeoff is speciﬁc to the particular problem of interest. The random selection of fragment insertions without consideration of gradient information or likelihood of the modiﬁcation being accepted allows fragment insertion to be an extremely rapid operation and is well suited for de novo structure prediction, where coarse topological information is of interest. Conversely, careful selection of a move with a higher probability of acceptance or an operation that modiﬁes many degrees of freedom simultaneously can be expensive to compute, yet may be a signiﬁcantly more effective modiﬁcation. Many structural modeling problems, including model reﬁnement and loop modeling, require ﬁner searches of a localized region of conformational space. For such problems, backbone modiﬁcations designed to effectively search local conformations are likely worth the extra computational expense.
Our goal in developing Rosetta is to assemble a uniﬁed platform for structural modeling that provides scoring functions and move sets applicable to a wide range of resolutions. The scoring function is modular, and

88

[4]

individual terms of the energy functions can be combined with weights optimized for speciﬁc applications. In addition, the move sets described here provide options for both coarse-grained and local conformational searches. Different combinations of these move sets and scoring functions provide Rosetta modules for de novo structure prediction, model reﬁnement, loop modeling, rigid body protein–protein docking, and protein design. Combinations of modules allow complex modeling problems to be approached. For example, combination of the de novo prediction, design, and model reﬁnement modules has been used to design a protein with a novel topology.10 Combining the docking and design modules allows alternative rigid body orientations to be explored for interface design, whereas combining the docking module with model reﬁnement is applicable to docking with backbone ﬂexibility.

Appendix I
Efficient Computation of MSD Induced by Rigid Body Transformation
After fragment insertion, the relative positions of the protein chains before and after the insertion point undergo a rigid body motion. A convenient and differentiable measure of this global change is to ﬁx one of the chains in space and compute the mean squared deviation (MSD) of the atoms in the other, ‘‘downstream’’ chain. Commonly, we want to compute this quantity quickly for all members of the fragment library at a given insertion position and then screen out the ones with a large MSD. This appendix discusses a general method for accelerating this screen and the computation of the derivative.

The decomposition of the MSD expression into translational and

rotational motion is not only illustrative, but also allows fragments to be

screened for motions that are both small in MSD and also primarily shear-

ing (or nonshearing) motions. For example, one might seek a motion

that twists a helix in place or, conversely, a pure shearing motion that

frame shifts a strand pairing without twisting it. Screening for fragments

with these effects is possible in this framework by unevenly weighting the

relative contribution of individual terms of Eq. (A2).

Efficient Computation of MSD Partial Derivatives

Following a fragment insertion that transforms the downstream chain from {Vˆ k} to {V^k0 }, this transformation can be counteracted by continuously
varying a selected set of torsion angles to minimize the MSD by gradient bdeefsocerentm(winoimbbizlea)t.ioHne, r{eV^{kV^} k0a}raerethtehetacrogoertdcinoaotredsinoaftethseodf otwhensdtroewanmstcrheaamin

In computing the gradient, one evaluates the partial derivative for each torsion axis. This calculation can be done efﬁciently by using the form in Eq. (A4): Vˆ atom and Bˆ differ for each torsion angle, but Vˆ ave, Vˆˆ a0ve, R, and E are determined by the conﬁguration and are the same for every torsion angle.

Applications of Efficient MSD Evaluation
Although the MSD is discussed above in the context of single-fragment replacement and subsequent continuous perturbation (wobble) of selected torsion angles, numerous other applications of these methods exist. In loop modeling, for example, the starting and ending points of a loop segment are known and the goal is to locate a fragment that will join these end points. This problem is isomorphic to computing the MSD in fragment replacement; although there is no existing fragment being replaced, the targets Aˆˆ 1 and Uˆ 1 are deﬁned by the ﬁxed segments. In addition, in the case of incomplete loop closure, the downstream chain position implied by the torsion angles of the terminal loop residue differs from the ﬁxed template

coordinates of the downstream chain. Gradient descent minimization of
this MSD can be used to perturb torsion angles of loop residues to close
this chain break. These methods are in fact incorporated into the loopmodeling strategy used in Rosetta (Rohl et al.12). In general, the methods
described here are applicable to computation and minimization of MSD between any two coordinate sets, {Vˆ k} and {Vˆ k0}.

Appendix II

Gunn Estimation of Global Perturbation Induced by Fragment Replacement

The net translation and rotation of the chain resulting from a fragment
is described by six degrees of freedom that can be chosen such that if
two fragments have nearly the same values for these six parameters, they produce nearly the same rotation and translation. Let xˆ1 be the unit vector along the N-to-C bond at the N terminus of the fragment, let xˆ2 be the analogous unit vector along the C-to-C bond at the C terminus of the fragment, and let Rˆ be the vector between the C atoms at the fragment N and C termini. Let yˆ1 and yˆ2 be the normals to the planes deﬁned by N, C, and C of the N- and C-terminal (respectively) residue of the fragment. The six parameters to describe the net rotation and translation are chosen
such that they are independent of the absolute position and orientation. q1 and q2, that is,

q1 ¼ ^x1 Á R^ q2 ¼ ^x2 Á R^

are proportional to the cosine of the polar angle of ﬁnal and initial bond

is the fragment length. These deﬁnitions match those of Gunn,12a other than the speciﬁc atoms used to deﬁne the coordinate system.
These parameters are independent of the orientation and origin of the coordinate system, allowing two fragments to be compared term by term:

where Áq is the difference between the respective q values of the original and replacement fragment and the absolute value also implies modulo- for the angular Áq values. The {c} coefﬁcients were determined by regression on a test set of single-domain proteins to make the cost function a good discriminator between small and large RMS deviations in the downstream chain induced the fragment swap. In Rosetta, {c} ¼ {5.72, 2.035, 3.84, 0.346}, and typical lower and upper cost thresholds are 0.03 and 4.08, respectively. In ballpark terms, these limits correspond to pure angular changes between $0.5 and $90, or pure displacements of less than $2 A˚ . When all the terms contribute equally to the cost, the upper limit on the deviation of any one angular degree of freedom falls to about 10.
In the above description, the effect of modifying (and !) of the C-terminal residue of the insertion window is not included in the six q parameters. These angles are inserted into the chain, however, to avoid potential violations of allowed Ramachandran space that may occur if the C-terminal residue (, ) angles are effectively drawn from different library fragments. Although this inaccuracy limits the discriminatory power of the cost function and could be corrected by modiﬁcation of the q parameter deﬁnitions, the cost function works well in practice, presumably because when the rotation and translation of two fragments are similar, the terminal torsion angles are likely to be similar as well.
