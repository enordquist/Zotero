Structural basis for gating the highconductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel
Richard K. Hite1, Xiao Tao1 & Roderick MacKinnon1

The precise control of an ion channel gate by environmental stimuli is crucial for the fulfilment of its biological role. The gate in Slo1 K+ channels is regulated by two separate stimuli, intracellular Ca2+ concentration and membrane voltage. Slo1 is thus central to understanding the relationship between intracellular Ca2+ and membrane excitability. Here we present the Slo1 structure from Aplysia californica in the absence of Ca2+ and compare it with the Ca2+-bound channel. We show that Ca2+ binding at two unique binding sites per subunit stabilizes an expanded conformation of the Ca2+ sensor gating ring. These conformational changes are propagated from the gating ring to the pore through covalent linkers and through protein interfaces formed between the gating ring and the voltage sensors. The gating ring and the voltage sensors are directly connected through these interfaces, which allow membrane voltage to regulate gating of the pore by influencing the Ca2+ sensors.

This study attempts to understand how Ca2+ and membrane voltage regulate opening of the Slo1 channel. As in other voltage-dependent K+ channels, the probability of Slo1 channel opening changes according to a sigmoidal-shaped function of membrane voltage1. To a first approximation, higher intracellular Ca2+ concentrations shift the midpoint of this function so that the channels open at less depolarized voltages2. Viewed from a different but equally useful perspective, again to a first approximation, membrane depolarization increases the affinity of Ca2+ to open the channel3. The physical basis of this coupling between Ca2+-dependent and voltage-dependent activation is unknown. To address this question, we have determined the structure of Slo1 in the absence of Ca2+ and compared it with the structure in the presence of Ca2+ (ref. 4). Large conformational changes within the Ca2+ sensor are transmitted to the pore and to the voltage sensor. The Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free structures permit a physical model that explains the influence of membrane voltage on Ca2+ activation. The model also provides a framework for understanding Slo1 gating properties that extend beyond a first approximation description. These properties include multi-exponential dwell time distributions, cooperativity in Ca2+ activation, and degrees of coupling between the pore, Ca2+ sensors and voltage sensors3,5–7.
The conformational changes presented here are consistent with many but not all of the conclusions reached on the basis of past mutagenesis data. Full consistency is impossible because different studies have put forth opposing conclusions on properties such as the degree and even direction of cooperative interaction in Ca2+ binding3,7,8, and the degree of functional interaction between voltage sensors and Ca2+ sensors5,9. Thus, the mechanistic hypotheses put forth here are structure based and can be tested with further experimentation.
Structure of Slo1 in EDTA Images of the frozen hydrated A. californica Slo1 channel vitrified in the presence of 1 mM EDTA were recorded (Extended Data Fig. 1). Four distinct classes (EDTA structure classes) were generated, with overall resolutions ranging from 3.8 to 4.1 Å (Extended Data Fig. 2). These are related to each other by a rotation of the transmembrane domain (TMD) up to 8° about the central four-fold axis of the ­channel (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The cytosolic tail domains, which form the gating ring, are internally similar to one another, and therefore focused

refinement with a soft mask containing only the gating ring was used to improve this region, which resolved to 3.5 Å (Extended Data Fig. 3). By contrast, focused refinement of the TMD degraded ­features of the map, consistent with non-uniformity of structure in the TMD. The non-uniformity was most evident in the degree of S6 closure (Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). Consideration of the EDTA structure focuses on the class in which the inner helices have adopted the most closed conformation (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2).
Influence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on Slo1 Ca2+ and Mg2+ have a major effect on the conformation of Slo1 that is most easily appreciated in a video comparing the Ca2+ and EDTA structures (Fig. 1a, b, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Video 1). These ions induce a 5 Å shortening of the channel along its pore axis associated with a compression of the gating ring against the TMD (Fig. 1a, b). Accompanying this compression, the S5 helices splay outwards away from the pore axis and the S6 helices change their position and shape (Fig. 1c). The S6 helices, which line the ion conduction pathway, bend at Pro309 and project 8 Å further towards the cytoplasm in the EDTA structure. In the Ca2+ structure they bend instead at Gly302 near the selectivity filter. These differences account for a wide (minimum diameter 20 Å below Pro309) aqueous channel leading from the cytoplasm to the selectivity filter in the Ca2+ structure, and a relatively narrower (minimum diameter 10 Å below Pro309) channel in the EDTA structure (Extended Data Fig. 2e).
Associated with conformational changes in the TMD, Ca2+ also induces conformational changes in the gating ring similar to those observed in gating-ring-only crystal structures10,11 (Fig. 1d). The regulator of K+ conductance-1 (RCK1) domain N-lobes of the gating ring, which face the TMD, tilt in a rigid body fashion away from the pore axis in the Ca2+ structure relative to the EDTA structure. The correlation of this expansion of the N-lobes with repositioning of S6 helices in the TMD is mediated at least in part through a polypeptide chain linkage that directly tethers the C terminus of S6 to the N terminus of the RCK1 N-lobe. In addition, protein interfacial interactions that will be discussed later also seem to mediate the propagation of conformational changes between the gating ring and the TMD.

The spheres represent the locations of the Cα​ atom of Lys320.

Chemical basis of Ca2+ activation The structure shows clearly why Ca2+ binding to two sites per subunit on the gating ring causes the channel to open. One of these sites (the Ca2+ bowl site) is located near the interface between RCK domains of adjacent subunits (Fig. 2a, b). When Ca2+ binds at this site, acidic amino acid side chains and main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from a loop on one subunit (the Ca2+ bowl) cradle the ion from one side, whereas ion coordination is made complete through contribution of an asparagine residue (Asn438) borrowed from the RCK1 N-lobe of the adjacent subunit. To approach the Ca2+ ion within an appropriate ligand distance the RCK1 N-lobe has to move to its open conformation (Fig. 2b). The second Ca2+ site (RCK1 site) is located between the RCK1 N-lobe and the rest of the RCK1 domain from the same subunit (Fig. 2a, c). When Ca2+ binds at this site, acidic amino acid side chains and main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the RCK1 domain surround most of the ion, but here again ion coordination is completed through the contribution of an aspartate residue (Asp356) borrowed from the RCK1 N-lobe. As for the first site, an appropriate ligand distance requires the RCK1 N-lobe to adopt its open conformation (Fig. 2c). Thus, the coordination of Ca2+ at both sites shifts the equilibrium for the position of the RCK1 N-lobe, favouring its open conformation. In this manner, the free energy of Ca2+ binding is directly converted to mechanical work to expand the RCK1 N-lobes and thus open the pore.

As a result of the chemical interactions described, tilting of an RCK1 N-lobe to its expanded conformation simultaneously completes both Ca2+-binding sites (Fig. 2a). This structural observation indicates the existence of positive cooperativity between Ca2+-binding sites on the channel, because Ca2+ coordination at one site should tend to r­ ender the other site complete and thereby increase its affinity for Ca2+. A second possible source of non-independence in the functioning of the two unique Ca2+-binding sites can be found in their structural connectivity within a subunit. The side chain of Arg503, the mainchain carbonyl oxygen atom of which coordinates Ca2+ in the RCK1 site, forms an ionized hydrogen bond with Glu912 and a cation–π​ ­interaction with Tyr914 (ref. 4). Glu912 and Tyr914 both reside on the Ca2+ bowl loop. Thus, the two Ca2+-binding sites within a s­ ingle ­subunit are structurally connected to each other through these ­interactions. For this reason, Ca2+ binding at one site could possibly exert an influence on the other site.
The fundamental property of cooperativity between Ca2+ sites has been established on the basis of functional studies3,6–8,12–15. The underlying reason for this cooperativity has been unclear, especially since different studies using mutagenesis have reached different conclusions as to the magnitude and even the sign (positive or negative) of the cooperative interactions3,7,8. On the basis of the atomic structures, we propose a mechanism for positive cooperative interactions between Ca2+-binding sites in the wild-type channel. This mechanism entails a rigid body tilting of the RCK1 N-lobe that simultaneously completes both sites. We think that this mechanism, together with the

multiplicity of sites, contributes to the high Hill coefficients that have been documented for Slo1 channels16–18.
Gating ring coupling to TMD Ca2+ binding induces conformational changes in the gating ring that are transmitted to the pore. The polypeptide linkers connecting the RCK1 N-lobes to the S6 helices provide one obvious structural element for transmitting force from the gating ring to the pore (Fig. 3a). These linkers are partly α​-helical and partly extended; their intrinsic structures are essentially identical in the Ca2+ and EDTA forms of the channel. They undergo a large positional displacement laterally, each as a rigid unit, in response to Ca2+-induced tilting of the RCK1 N-lobes. On the basis of mutational studies in which amino acids were deleted or added, the linker–gating ring complex has been described as a passive spring14. Given that the linkers do not lengthen perceptibly when Ca2+ binding expands the pore, any spring properties perhaps arise from within the gating ring.
The RCK1 N-lobes also form a specific protein–protein interface (585 Å2 per subunit in the Ca2+ structure) with the voltage sensors and the S4–S5 linkers that connect the voltage sensors to the pore (Figs 3b and 4). Ca2+-induced conformational changes in the gating ring alter these interfaces and produce an outward (away from the pore axis) displacement of the voltage sensors near their cytoplasmic surface where they contact the RCK1 N-lobes (Figs 3b and 4). The S4 helices

shift slightly but maintain their relative proximity to the S5 helices, suggesting that strong favourable interactions between S4 and S5 resist their coming apart (Fig. 3c). Consequently, the outward (laterally away from the pore) displacement of the voltage sensors and S4–S5 linkers produces a similar outward displacement of the S5 helices near the cytoplasmic surface (Figs 3c and 4). Thus, it appears that Ca2+-induced tilting of the RCK1 N-lobes transmits force to the pore through two pathways, one that directly pulls open the S6 helices through covalent linker attachments and the other that is indirectly mediated through non-covalent protein–protein interfaces formed between the RCK1 N-lobes and the voltage sensors/S4–S5 linkers. The latter pathway splays open the voltage sensors and S5 helices, the former simultaneously pulls open the S6 helices.
The organization of functional domains in Slo1 gives rise to a source of inter-subunit cooperativity. Because voltage sensors are not domain-swapped (that is, voltage sensors contact pore domains from the same polypeptide chain) and RCK domains in the gating ring are domain-swapped, each RCK1 N-lobe exerts force on two subunits simultaneously. Consider, for example, the Ca2+-induced tilting of a specific RCK1 N-lobe: while it pulls on the S6 helix from its own subunit, at the same time it splays the voltage sensor/S4–S5 linker from an adjacent subunit by virtue of its domain-swapped disposition with respect to the TMD. The applied action of each RCK1 N-lobe onto

two adjacent TMD subunits provides a basis for understanding the inter-subunit cooperativity of Ca2+ activation that has been demonstrated experimentally3,6–8,12,13,15,17.
Regulation by voltage The above description focused on the gating ring–voltage sensor interface as a conduit for Ca2+ activation of the pore. The same interface also appears poised to transmit conformational changes that occur within the voltage sensors to regulate gating. The S4–S5 linker is one of the key structural elements on the TMD side of the interface and therefore movements of S4 helices should directly impinge on movements of the RCK1 N-lobes on the gating ring. The interface also contains a Mg2+ ion, the binding site of which was predicted by mutagenesis studies11,16,19–24. In the Ca2+ structure, the Mg2+ ion mediates several interactions that bridge the RCK1 N-lobe to the TMD via helix S0′​ and the S2–S3 linker (Fig. 4b).
Figure 5 compares the conformations of the voltage sensors in the Ca2+ and EDTA structures. In EDTA, the S4 helix is shifted approximately 2 Å towards the cytoplasm. This change is mediated by differences in the chemical environment (EDTA versus Ca2+) rather than membrane voltage; however, the shift occurred in the expected direction: channel closure is associated with a downward movement of gating charges. The shift occurred in this case because movement of the RCK1 N-lobes, mediated by the absence versus presence of Ca2+, is coupled to movement of the voltage sensors. Through the same coupling we would expect that voltage-sensor movements driven primarily by the membrane electric field should move the RCK1 N-lobes, or at least apply a bias to their preferred position. Thus, we hypothesize that voltage-dependent gating in Slo1, at least to some extent, is mediated through voltage-sensor regulation of the Ca2+ sensor.
The above reasoning is based on the correlation between Ca2+ activation and the direction of voltage-sensor movement rather than the degree or nature of the movement. It seems that arginine residues reach towards the same negatively charged residues in both voltage-sensor structures. If the membrane electric field during hyperpolarization were the primary driving force for conformational change, we would expect the arginine residues to alter their side-chain rotamer conformation (that is, to reach down) to establish new ion pairs. With reorientation

of arginine side chains, the small displacement of the S4 helix observed here might be sufficient to account for the voltage-dependence of Slo1 gating. Given the facts considered in the companion paper4—weak voltage-dependence with small gating charge displacement currents, a short S4–S5 linker, close packing of the S4 and S5 helices, and an incomplete gating charge transfer centre—we suspect that the voltage sensor in Slo1 has evolved to be a modifier of the Ca2+ sensor through small movements that bias the conformation of the RCK1 N-lobe4.
Discussion Structures of the Slo1 channel in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ suggest that pore opening is regulated primarily through the position of four RCK1 N-lobes on the gating ring. Ca2+-binding sites and voltage sensors determine the position of the RCK1 N-lobes. Thus, we propose that the RCK1 N-lobes are a nexus for both forms of channel regulation, as depicted in Fig. 6. At an intuitive level, this proposal provides a physical basis for understanding why membrane voltage influences the Ca2+ affinity for channel activation. Membrane depolarization will favour an open conformation of the RCK1 N-lobes, which will favour a Ca2+-bound conformation of the binding sites and thus increase their apparent affinity. Similarly, Ca2+ binding will favour a depolarized conformation of the voltage sensors. This description is meant to capture an important property of the structures; that the voltage sensor communicates with the Ca2+ sensor. However, experiments under extreme conditions of voltage and Ca2+ have shown that each sensor can work independently to some degree to regulate the pore5,24,25.
The structures and our interpretation of them are compatible with the two most prominent features of Ca2+-mediated gating in Slo1 channels: the multiplicity of Ca2+ sites and the cooperativity between them3,7,8,26–28. Closed-state dwell-time distributions as a function of Ca2+ concentration forecast the existence of several Ca2+ sites18,29,30. Mutagenesis studies then predicted two distinct sites per subunit, eight in total26–28,31. The dependence of both sites on the conformation of an RCK1 N-lobe naturally accounts for the existence of cooperativity between the sites.
The EDTA and Ca2+ structures are both four-fold symmetric and might therefore suggest a mechanism in which a highly concerted

transition occurs upon opening. Even without symmetry restraints, asymmetric classes were not observed. However, this study addressed only extreme conditions of low and high Ca2+ (and Mg2+). On the basis of the structures alone, we see no reason why intermediate, asymmetric conformations could not exist. We posit that the probability of the pore opening is a function of the state of the gating ring, which would be defined by the occupancy of its Ca2+ sites and conformations of the voltage sensors. We further imagine that under any given condition of Ca2+ and membrane voltage the gating ring would exhibit a distribution of states. This physical description would be in keeping with the multi-exponential distribution of closed states, with cooperative activation by Ca2+ and with the interaction between Ca2+ and membrane voltage to activate the channel18,29,30. This physical description is also in keeping with thermodynamic and kinetic models of Slo1 gating that have been developed over many years5,6,18.
In a model called the HA (Horrigan–Aldrich) allosteric model, Slo1 is treated as a K+ pore in which gating is linked by energetic coupling constants to the conformational state of Ca2+ sensors and voltage sensors5. In the context of this model, we can inspect the physical basis of the linkage between the pore and its sensor modules. The Ca2+ sensors—or gating ring, with its many Ca2+-binding sites—are linked directly to the pore through the S6 linkers and indirectly through the non-covalent interfaces formed between the RCK1 N-lobes and the voltage sensors/S4–S5 linkers (Fig. 3). The voltage sensors are linked to the pore directly through interactions between S4 and S5 helices and indirectly through the same voltage sensor–gating ring interfaces. Given the well-formed interface between the S4–S5 linker and the RCK1 N-lobe, we suspect that the coupling between the Ca2+ sensor and the voltage sensor is likely to be strong (Fig. 4). This coupling would not preclude additional direct coupling between the voltage sensor and the pore, which is a prominent feature of the HA allosteric model strongly supported by functional data5. In the present study, we have only manipulated Ca2+ (and Mg2+) and therefore a real

understanding of voltage-sensor movements must await structural studies in electric fields.
Many K+ channels are known to close through constriction of the S6 (inner) helices. The S6-lined region of the pore is not constricted sufficiently in the EDTA structure to prevent ions from reaching the selectivity filter from the cytoplasm. This observation is consistent with the demonstrated accessibility of large organic molecules to the central cavity (below the selectivity filter) in the closed conformation of Slo1 channels32–35. To explain closure it has been proposed that S6 helix displacements are coupled to changes in the selectivity filter to prevent ion conduction32–34. The EDTA structure is consistent with such a mechanism, at least in terms of the S6 helices being too open to preclude ion passage (the selectivity filter is unchanged from the open structure). However, we consider the issue of gate location still unsettled. The EDTA structure is the most closed in a distribution of structural classes (Extended Data Fig. 2). It is possible that we have not resolved the fully closed pore. The closed gating-ring-only crystal structure is 3 Å narrower at the N terminus of the RCK1 N-lobe, which could suggest that further closure is possible10 (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Methods
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Cloning, expression and purification of the EDTA states. A synthetic gene fragment (Bio Basic, Inc.) encoding residues 1 to 1070 of the A. californica Slo1 channel was ligated into the XhoI/EcoRI cloning sites of a modified pFastBac vector (Invitrogen). The resulting protein has a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a 1D4 antibody recognition sequence (TETSQVAPA) on the C terminus36, separated by a PreScission protease cleavage site (SNSLEVLFQ/GP; underlined residues denote the consensus cleavage site).
For large-scale expression, High Five cells at a density of 1 ×​  106 per ml were infected with 3% (v/v) baculovirus and cultured at 27 °C in sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) for 48 h before harvesting. Cells were gently disrupted by stirring in a hypotonic solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors including 0.1 μg​ ml−1 pepstatin A, 1 μ​g ml−1 leupeptin, 1 μ​g ml−1 aprotinin, 0.1 mg ml−1 soy trypsin inhibitor, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mg ml−1 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) and 1 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cell lysate was then centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000g and pellet was homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 320mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors including 0.1 μ​g ml−1 pepstatin A, 1 μ​g ml−1 leupeptin, 1 μ​g ml−1 aprotinin, 0.1 mg ml−1 soy trypsin inhibitor, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mg ml−1 AEBSF and 0.2 mM PMSF. The lysate was extracted with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β​-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) and 0.2% (w/v) cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS) for 1 h with stirring and then centrifuged for 40 min at 30,000g. Supernatant was added to GFP nanobody-conjugated affinity resin (CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin from GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 320 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% DDM, 0.04% CHS, 0.1 μ​g ml−1 pepstatin A, 1 μ​g ml−1 aprotinin and 0.1 mg ml−1 soy trypsin inhibitor)37,38. The suspension was mixed by inversion for approximately 2 h. Beads were first washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer in batch mode and then collected on a column by gravity, washed with another 10 column volumes of wash buffer. The protein was then digested on resin with PreScission protease (~​20:1 (w/w) ratio) overnight with gentle rocking. Flow-through was then collected, concentrated and further purified on a Superose-6 size exclusion column in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 450 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM DTT, 2 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), 0.1 μg​ ml−1 pepstatin A, 1 μg​ ml−1 aprotinin, 0.025% DDM and 0.005% CHS. All purification procedures were carried out either on ice or at 4 °C. The peak fractions corresponding to the tetrameric Slo1 channel was concentrated to about 7 mg ml−1 and used for preparation of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) sample grids. Electron microscopy sample preparation and imaging of EDTA structures. First, 3.5 μ​l of purified channel in the presence of 1 mM EDTA was pipetted onto a glow discharged copper C-flat grids (Protochips). Grids were then blotted for 4 s at ~​88% humidity and flash frozen in liquid-nitrogen-cooled liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI). Grids were transferred to an FEI Titan Krios (FEI) electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 300 keV. Images were recorded in an automated fashion on a Gatan K2 Summit (Gatan) detector set to super-resolution counting mode with a super-resolution pixel size of 0.675 Å using SerialEM39. Images were recorded for 15 s with a sub-frame exposure time of 300 ms and a dose of 4.5 electrons per Å2 per second (~​1.4 electrons per Å2 per sub-frame) at the specimen level and 8 electrons per pixel per second at the detector. Total accumulated dose was 68 electrons per Å2. Image processing and map calculation. Dose-fractionated super-resolution images were 2 ×​ 2 down sampled by Fourier cropping (final pixel size of 1.35 Å) for whole-frame motion correction and dose filtration with unblur40. Approximately 4,000 particles were manually selected using RELION to generate templates for automated particle selection41. Following automated particle selection in RELION, false positives were manually eliminated, resulting in 637,592 particles from 4,748 images. 256 ×​ 256 pixel particle images were extracted from the motion-corrected and dose-filtered images in RELION. The parameters of the contrast transfer function were estimated by ctffind4 (ref. 42).
The initial set of 637,592 particles was subjected to 2D classification in RELION to remove particles belonging to low-abundance classes and to generate projection averages for initial model generation using EMAN2 (ref. 43). 3D classification was used to sort the remaining 453,775 particles into six classes. Three of the resulting classes, comprising 230,242 particles, appeared similar and were combined. Rotations and translations were determined for the 230,242 particles by using the 3D auto-refine algorithm of RELION, resulting in a map that achieved an overall resolution of 3.8 Å. The density was very clear for the gating ring, but was very poor for the TMD. To improve the density corresponding to the gating ring, a soft mask was generated that encompassed the gating ring and used throughout a RELION auto-refine run. The rotation and translational parameters determined by RELION

for the three classes were used as the input for 30 additional cycles of refinement by FREALIGN44, during which the resolution of the reference used for alignment of the particle images was limited to 6 Å to minimize over refinement, resulting in a map that achieved a resolution of 3.5 Å as assessed by Fourier shell correlation using the 0.143 cut-off criterion45. Assuming that the poor density of the TMD was a result of conformational flexibility, another round of 3D classification using the rotational and transitional parameters determined by the auto-refine run was performed to further sort the particles into 6 classes. Of the resulting classes, four contained interpretable density for the TMD and were selected for independent refinement in RELION. The rotation and translational parameters determined by RELION for the four classes were used as the input for 10–30 additional cycles of refinement by FREALIGN, during which the resolution of the reference used for alignment of the particle images was limited to 6 Å to minimize over refinement, resulting in maps that achieved a resolution of 3.8–4.1 Å as assessed by Fourier shell correlation using the 0.143 cut-off criterion45. To improve the resolution of the EDTA reconstruction, per-particle frame alignment was performed using LM-BFGS46, followed by 2D and 3D classification in RELION. The particles that belonged to a class that closely resembled the EDTA 4 state were selected for auto-refinement in RELION. The rotation and translational parameters determined by RELION were used as the input for 30 additional cycles of refinement by FREALIGN44, during which the resolution of the reference used for alignment of the particle images was limited to 6 Å to minimize over refinement, resulting in a map that achieved a resolution of 3.8 Å as assessed by Fourier shell correlation using the 0.143 cut-off criterion45.
Local resolution estimates were calculated with ResMap47. The map was sharpened using an isotropic b-factor of −2​ 00 Å2 before model building and coordinate refinement. The final map was sharpened to best fit the molecular transform of the refined atomic model by diffmap (http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/diffmap). Model building and coordinate refinement. The structure of the closed human Slo1 gating ring (PDB code 3NAF)10 was docked into the focused refinement cryo-EM density map using UCSF Chimera48 and then manually rebuilt in Coot49 to fit the density.
The cryo-EM density map of one of the half-maps corresponding to a new smaller unit cell that extended 5 Å from the model in all directions was extracted. Cycles of real space refinement using phenix.real_space_refine50 with P4 symmetry imposed and reciprocal space refinement using REFMAC51 with P4 symmetry imposed were alternated with manual rebuilding in Coot. Geometric and secondary structure restraints were tightly maintained throughout refinement to minimize over fitting. To monitor the effects of over fitting, the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of the refined model was determined for the half-map used during refinement (FSC work) and the half-map that was not used at any point during refinement (FSC free) (Extended Data Fig. 6).
The refined model of the gating ring and the refined model of Ca2+-bound A. californica Slo1 TMD were docked into the unpolished density maps for EDTA classes 1, 2 and 3 and the polished density map of EDTA class 4 using UCSF Chimera and then manually rebuilt in Coot to fit the density. The models were refined in real and reciprocal space against one of the half-maps to the overall resolution of the corresponding whole map, while monitoring the effects of over fitting using the second half-map (Extended Data Fig. 6). Representative sections of the density for the polished EDTA class 4 map and the gating ring focused refined map with the refined models are shown in Extended Data Fig. 7. All structure calculations were performed using software compiled by SBGrid52. Structure figures were prepared with UCSF Chimera and Pymol (Pymol version 1.7.2 Schrodinger LLC). Data availability.
