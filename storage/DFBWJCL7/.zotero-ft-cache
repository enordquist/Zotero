The dynamics of a cavitation transition between repulsive plates in a Lennard-Jones system is studied using transition path sampling. It is found that the critical nucleus for the transition coincides with the formation of a vapor tube connecting the two plates. The number of particles between the plates and the tube radius are relevant order parameters. In the transition state ensemble, the distributions of these parameters have widths that are roughly 20% of their respective means. Committor distributions of constrained ensembles show that of these two important parameters, the tube radius is the most signiﬁcant component in the reaction coordinate for the cavitation transition. © 2000 American Institute of Physics. ͓S0021-9606͑00͒52042-X͔

I. INTRODUCTION

A liquid that is thermodynamically stable in the bulk, can become metastable with respect to the vapor phase when conﬁned between two hard or repulsive walls. When the walls are close enough to each other, cavitation occurs, and the liquid evaporates.1 This transition, akin to drying, may explain solvophobic ͑e.g., hydrophobic͒ attractions.2–7 Such interactions are believed to play a central role in the formation and stability of mesoscopic assembly, including biological structures.
For large solvophobic surfaces, macroscopic arguments apply, and one can make an estimate for the critical separation, Dc , at which the liquid is destabilized against the vapor. The liquid ﬁlm has an unfavorable surface energy proportional to the net surface area. This energy is opposed by the favorable bulk free energy which is proportional to the difference in chemical potential between the gas and the liquid. For large separation D the bulk free energy dominates and the liquid ﬁlm is stable. If D is of the order

where ␥ is the surface tension, nl is the liquid density and ␮lg the difference between gas and liquid chemical potentials. When the ﬂuid is relatively close to liquid–gas coexistence, this critical distance can be quite large on a molecular scale. For instance, for water at ambient conditions Dc Ϸ100 nm.
For smaller surfaces down to the nanometer length scale, the same qualitative reasoning applies, although the critical distance will be smaller. In contrast, for very small solutes, solvophobic particles of the same size as the solvent molecules, drying is not observed. Attractive interactions between solvent molecules, manifested for example in surface

tension, can accommodate a very small solute without much
loss of adhesive energy. According to the theory of Lum, Chandler, and Weeks,2 the crossover to the drying regime
occurs for solvophobic surfaces that extend over a few cor-
relation lengths. For example, hard spheres in water induce
solvent density depletion when the sphere radii are about 1 nm or larger.2 Hard spheres in the Lennard-Jones liquid near
its triple point induce similar depletion when the sphere radii are larger than about 2.5␴, where ␴ is the usual LennardJones particle diameter.8
The ﬁrst simulation of a drying ͑also called cavitation͒ transition between two repulsive walls was done by Benard, Attard, and Patey,3 although earlier work exists on drying at
a single wall. These authors studied the equilibrium proper-
ties of the ﬁrst order transition by Monte Carlo methods.
Drying of surfaces immersed in water and the resulting hy-
drophobic force was observed in a computer experiment by Wallqvist and Berne9 using molecular dynamics. Subsequently, Forsman et al.4–7 focused on the relation between
hydration and hydrophobic forces in water using isotension
and grand canonical simulation. Since then, a few other the-
oretical studies have been performed using simple liquid models with Lennard-Jones-type interactions.10,11
There are fewer studies of the dynamics of this transi-
tion. Lum and Luzar studied a drying transition between solvophobic plates in a lattice gas by employing Glauber dynamics.12 They concluded that the transition is driven by surface ﬂuctuations. Subsequent analytical work identiﬁed a reasonable reaction path and estimated the activation free energy for this drying of a semi-inﬁnite slab.13 Until the work we report on now in this paper, no continuous offlattice ﬂuid model has been used to study the dynamics of the drying transition. The absence of such work is not surprising since in general, the drying transition is a rare event. As such, a straightforward dynamical simulation is generally infeasible. A standard way to study the dynamics of rare events is the application of the reactive ﬂux method.14 This

Cavitation between solvophobic surfaces 8155

method requires a priori knowledge of a physically reasonable reaction coordinate. However, for the ﬁnite solvophobic plate system considered here, the reaction coordinate is not known. As such, application of the reactive ﬂux method for this situation can be misleading. To overcome this problem, we use the method of transition path sampling, recently developed by the authors and their coworkers.15–18 Transition path sampling enables one to harvest an ensemble of trajectories that connect one basin of attraction with another. The algorithm requires no preconceived notion of mechanisms or transition states.
We investigate the drying transition between two repulsive plates in a Lennard-Jones ﬂuid. The principle aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to show that it is possible to study this type of ﬁrst-order like transitions with high activation barriers using the transition path sampling method. Secondly, to establish a proper reaction coordinate for the cavitation transition. A ﬁrst candidate for a reaction coordinate for the cavitation transition is the distance between the plates. However, the transition also occurs for surfaces at a ﬁxed distance.3 Clearly, the reaction coordinate must involve another parameter. The next likely candidate is the density of the ﬂuid between the plates, which is low in the case of a vapor and high for a liquid ﬁlm. As we show in this paper, this order parameter does not describe the full dynamics either. The transition occurs via a nucleation mechanism, creating a tube of vapor connecting the two surfaces that grows into a vapor layer. By computing the committor distributions for constrained ensembles,19,20 we demonstrate that the size of the vapor nucleus is most likely the correct reaction coordinate for the cavitation transition.
Note that the drying transition is strictly only a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit, for macroscopic surfaces. In this paper, we use the term phase transition also for ﬁnite systems. This terminology is very tempting, as the characteristics of the transitions are much akin to macroscopic ﬁrst-order phase transitions, including the mechanism of nucleation.
This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the model system we use to study the drying transition. Subsequently, we discuss the computed force between the two surfaces as a function of their distance. The results indicate a collective density depletion, akin to a ﬁrstorder phase transition, takes place for plates at a ﬁxed distance. Section IV focuses on this cavitation transition between two plates at ﬁxed distance. In Sec. V, we investigate the dynamics of this transition by transition path sampling. The path ensemble is subsequently analyzed by determining the transition state ensemble. In Sec. VII, the validity of several order parameters is tested by computing committor distributions. We end with concluding remarks.

II. MODEL

We studied the drying transition between two repulsive

plates in a truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones ͑LJ͒ ﬂuid.

The pair potential between the ﬂuid particles is given by

͑2͒

FIG. 1. The system consists of a truncated and shifted LJ ﬂuid between two repulsive walls ͑external ﬁeld͒. The system is periodic in the x and y direction. The outer walls dry at low temperatures and a stable liquid ﬁlm is formed between the outer walls ͑left picture͒. Inside the ﬂuid two repulsive ͑solvophobic͒ plates are placed. For clarity, the middle ﬁgure shows only the small plates and the liquid layer in between. The region between these plates is where the cavitation takes place. In the right panel the liquid has evaporated.

Here, r is the interparticle distance, Rcϭ2.5␴ is the cut-off radius, and ␾(r) is the usual Lennard-Jones potential

where ⑀ is the depth of the potential and ␴ is the diameter of the particles.
As we are interested in the dynamics of the cavitation or drying transition, it is not possible to use simulation techniques in which only the ﬂuid between the two plates is simulated, such as grand canonical or isotension algorithms.1,3,4 We have to allow for the ﬂuid to diffuse out of the space between the plates. Therefore, we instead chose the system setup shown in Fig. 1. Two circular plates with a radius of 3␴ each are immersed in a LJ ﬂuid and interact via the purely repulsive Weeks–Chandler–Andersen ͑WCA͒ potential with the solvent particles. The WCA potential is given by

ͭ v WCA͑ r ͒ ϭ

␾͑ r ͒ϩ⑀ if rрrWCAϵ21/6␴

0 if rϾrWCA

.

͑4͒

The WCA potential acts along the line of shortest distance between the center-of-mass of the LJ particles and the plate. The size of the plates is large enough to exhibit drying.8 Taking 2 Å ␴ 4 Å, the plates are of the same length scale as hydrophobic surfaces of biomolecules in aqueous solution. For simplicity, the plates remain parallel, perpendicular to the x axis and are only allowed to move along the x axis.
Due to the expected cavitation, the density outside the plates and, therefore, the total pressure is likely to increase. Therefore, a constant pressure simulation is required. Applying a Nose–Hoover chain21 in order to create a constant pressure and temperature ensemble is unphysical for this application because it artiﬁcially changes the volume. Instead, we ensured constant pressure by dressing two opposite walls of the simulation box with a repulsive WCA potential. At conditions sufﬁciently close to the triple point, the outer walls dry and vapor–liquid coexistence is established. If the simulation box is large enough, the liquid ﬁlm will be stable and

8156 J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 113, No. 18, 8 November 2000
show near bulk behavior. Inside this stable liquid, the two plates are put perpendicular to the outside walls to have minimal impact of lateral ﬂuctuations.
In all simulations we employed the Lennard-Jones potential, truncated at 2.5␴ and subsequently shifted to obtain a continuous potential. The plates and the outer walls are made repulsive with a WCA potential. Throughout the paper we use the standard reduced Lennard-Jones units, i.e., length is measured in units of ␴, energies in units of ⑀, time in units of ␶ϭ(m␴2/⑀)1/2. The systems consisted of 2000 particles in a box with sides of length 13.9629␴, 11.9682␴, and 19.9469␴ for the x, y, and z dimensions, respectively. The z dimension was chosen longer to ensure a reasonably thick liquid layer that would exhibit near bulk behavior. The overall number density was ␳␴3ϭ0.6. In the molecular dynamics ͑MD͒ simulations we used a time step ⌬tϭ0.01␶.

III. FORCE BETWEEN PLATES
We calculated the average force, f, between the plates as a function of the distance D between the plates. In a microcanonical MD simulation the plates were constrained at a ﬁxed distance. The system was then equilibrated for 10 000 time steps, after which the forces on the plates were measured for a duration of 10 000 time steps. Subsequently, the inter plate distance was changed by 0.2␴ and the force was measured again. In this way we obtained the full force curves for both compressing ͑bringing the plates closer together͒ and expanding. The cycle of compression and expansion between D/␴ϭ3.6 and D/␴ϭ6.4 was repeated about 10 times, to obtain better statistics. The force curves are shown in Fig. 2 for the reduced temperatures T*ϵkBT/⑀ϭ0.81, 0.67, and 0.58 (kB denotes Boltzmann’s constant͒. The temperature of the system was imposed by adjusting the total energy of the system. All curves show a zero force at large plate separation, which corresponds to a stable liquid ﬁlm between the plates. At smaller separation the vapor phase becomes stable, causing a pressure imbalance that results in the net attractive force.
The upper panel of Fig. 2 represents the highest temperature case and shows no hysteresis between the compression and expansion curves. The middle panel already has a small amount of hysteresis. In contrast, the force curve for the lowest temperature, where T*ϭ0.58, is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2, and exhibits a large amount of hysteresis, suggesting that even for a ﬁxed distance between the plates, density depletion, or cavitation will occur in a fashion akin to a ﬁrst order transition between a liquid ﬁlm and a vapor. The lowest temperature is still above the triple point temperature. The triple point temperature for the truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones model we use here is approximately at kBT/⑀Ϸ0.55. We estimated this value by determining the point of intersection of the vapor liquid coexistence curve with the ﬂuid solid line. The vapor–liquid coexistence was obtained by extrapolation of the Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo simulation results by Smit.22 The solid-ﬂuid coexistence curve was estimated by taking the Gibbs Duhem integration results of Agrawal and Kofke23 for the regular Lennard-Jones system and assuming that the shifting and

truncating will shift the temperature slightly downwards, but will not change the phase behavior drastically.
IV. FIXED PLATE DISTANCE
Before embarking on the transition dynamics for moving plates, we studied the drying transition in system with ﬁxed plates. In this case, an obvious order parameter characterizing the basins of attraction is the bulk particle density between the plates, which is high in the liquid phase and low in

FIG. 3. Free energy for a ﬁxed plate distance D/␴ϭ5.6␴ at T*ϭ0.58 as a function of the particle density between the plates. The free energy curve has two minima. The minimum at low n corresponds to the vapor phase, which is the most stable in this situation. The liquid phase between the plates is metastable.

the vapor. As the system is of ﬁnite size, we specify this density with the total number of particles, n, between the two plates. Conversion to the density is easily done by dividing by the volume between the plates. The free energy as a function of the density or number of particles is informative. It is

F͑ n ͒ϭϪkBT ln͓ P͑ n ͔͒,

͑5͒

where P(n) is the probability to ﬁnd n particles between the plates.
We performed Monte Carlo umbrella sampling24 for the Lennard-Jones system described in Sec. II with a ﬁxed plate distance of 5.6␴ and a temperature T*ϭ0.58. These values corresponds to a large hysteresis in the force curves. Five windows were sampled, 0рnр20, 20рnр40, 30рnр50, 45рnр65, and 60рnр90. The system was not allowed to sample outside a window. The sampling was biased to obtain a ﬂat distribution in each window for optimal statistics. The free energy curve was estimated by matching the histograms for each window and applying Eq. ͑5͒. The free energy as a function of n is shown in Fig. 3. It clearly shows two stable states separated by a barrier. The liquid ﬁlm turns out to be metastable, as one would expect for a small interplate distance. The plates are repulsive, and the vapor–liquid coexistence will shift to lower temperature, so the gas phase will be stabilized. Were we to think that the order parameter n is also a good approximation to a reaction coordinate, the barrier shown in Fig. 3 would seem rather low. Straightforward molecular dynamics indicate that the system stays in the liquid ﬁlm state for a considerable time, tϾ100␶. ͑The time will be even longer for solvophobic surfaces with larger areas at larger distances.͒ The apparent low barrier found for F(n) is evidence that another variable in addition to n is needed to describe the dynamics of the transition.

V. TRANSITION PATH SAMPLING
The method of transition path sampling enables one to collect trajectories connecting two stable regions A and B

Cavitation between solvophobic surfaces 8157

with a Monte Carlo algorithm called ‘‘shooting.’’16,17 In this

algorithm, one randomly chooses a particular conﬁguration

on an existing initial trajectory and changes the momenta

slightly. By integrating the equations of motion forward and

backward in time one obtains a new trial path. If the trajec-

tory still connects A with B the Monte Carlo shooting move

is accepted and one replaces the old path with the trial. If it

fails to connect A with B, the trial path will be rejected. In

this way one can sample trajectory space and obtain dynami-

cal information from an ensemble of pathways. For the cavi-

tation transition, we deﬁned the initial state by nϾ60 ͑the liquid ﬁlm͒ and the ﬁnal state by nϽ30 ͑the vapor phase͒.

These values are chosen such that even at the boundaries of

a stable state, the system is completely committed to the

basin of attraction of that stable state. The stable liquid and

vapor states are denoted L and G, respectively. An initial

path was obtained by shooting from the top of the barrier

obtained by umbrella sampling of n. A workable trajectory

was only found after a considerable amount of trial shoots,

indicating that the transmission coefﬁcient is low. Such a

low value suggests that the order parameter n is not a good

description for the reaction coordinate.

The length of the trajectories used in the path sampling simulations was T ϭ80␶. Every 0.8␶ a conﬁguration was

saved, resulting in a total of 100 time slices per trajectory.

The number of attempted shoots was 2000 of which 15% was accepted. The number of shifting moves17 was 2000

with an acceptance ratio of 60%. We also applied 50 000

small shifts of one time slice each to obtain better statistics in

the time correlation functions. The path sampling simula-

tions were done in the microcanonical ensemble. The total
energy was kept constant at EϭϪ8000⑀, which roughly corresponds to a temperature of T*ϭ0.58.
The reactive ﬂux time correlation ͗hL(0)hG(t)͘ can be used to check if representative paths are harvested by the sampling.16 The characteristic function hA(t) for stable state A is deﬁned as

ͭ1
hA͑t͒ϭ 0

if n͑t ͒෈A

if n͑t ͒

, A

͑6͒

where n(t) is the number of particles between the plates at a time t along the trajectory. The pointed brackets indicate an ensemble average over trajectories. If this correlation function reaches a linear regime the trajectories are long enough to incorporate most of the dynamical pathways. If this criterion is not fulﬁlled, path sampling should consider longer trajectories. The reactive ﬂux ͗hL(0)hG(t)͘ and its time derivative were calculated during the path sampling simulation. A plateau in the time derivative of ͗hL(0)hG(t)͘ is reached for tϾ60␶, showing the path length is sufﬁciently long.
In principle, it is possible to extract rate constants from path ensembles using an umbrella sampling technique.16–18 This technique is the most computationally intensive part of transition path sampling. Since this study is only concerned with the qualitative nature of the drying transition dynamics, we have not performed quantitative rate constant calculations.
To reveal the mechanism of the transition, we plot a typical trajectory as a sequence of conﬁgurations in Fig 4.

FIG. 4. Typical pathway as obtained from the transition path sampling. Only the region between the plates is shown. The times are given in units of ␶ from the start of the trajectory. The conﬁguration at the center is the transition state for this trajectory.

For clarity, only the region between the two hydrophobic plates is depicted and the plates themselves are not shown. The sequence shows the formation of a gas bubble between the two plates which grows into a vapor layer. This suggests that the transition from the liquid to the vapor takes place via a nucleation of a critical vapor nucleus. Consistent with this mechanism, in some trajectories, we ﬁnd the formation of subcritical vapor bubbles that subsequently disappear.

VI. TRANSITION STATE ENSEMBLE
One of the ways to analyze transition path sampling results is by determining the transition state ensemble ͑TSE͒ from the path ensemble. The TSE can be obtained with the method described in Refs. 17 and 25. For every time slice on a path one calculates the so-called committors, pG and pL . These quantities are the probabilities that trajectories initiated from that conﬁguration will quickly ﬂow, respectively, to gaslike or liquidlike conﬁgurations. A conﬁguration for which pGϭ pL is considered a member of the transition state ensemble ͑TSE͒. We have found such members of the TSE by initiating 50 trajectories for every time slice. The length of each trajectory was 40␶.
In order to visualize the TSE, one can calculate several distribution functions. The upper panel of Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the number of particles between the plates, n, for the TSE. The variation in the number of particles is not small, indicating the importance of another variable in the kinetics. Upon inspection, we have found that all TSE conﬁgurations exhibit a gas bubble between the two plates. This ﬁnding suggests the importance bubble size. The vapor bubble size in the TSE corresponds to a critical nucleus size. We estimated the size of the vapor nucleus by determining the largest cylinder with a radius rb perpendicular to the plates that ﬁts in the bubble without overlapping with any of the ﬂuid particle’s center-of-mass. The distribution of the

bubble size is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 5. The bubble size distribution has an average of rbϭ1.3␴, and a standard deviation of 0.2␴. The relative standard deviation is larger than that of n in the TSE, but the distribution in this case is smoother. Figure 6 shows the harvested members of the TSE projected onto the nϪrb plane. It is clear that both variables, n and rb , are important in the kinetics.

Cavitation between solvophobic surfaces 8159

cates again that the bubble size is a good reaction coordinate. On the basis of nucleation theory,13 we expect this result to hold for larger solvophobic surfaces, whereas we expect the committor distribution for n to become ﬂatter and even bimodal for larger solvophobic surfaces.

FIG. 7. Distribution of the committor pG for constrained ensembles nϭ49 ͑dotted line͒, nϭ50 ͑dashed line͒ and nϭ51 ͑dot-dashed line͒. The distribution of the committor pG for a constrained ensemble with rb /␴ϭ1.28 is shown as a solid line.
VII. COMMITTOR DISTRIBUTION
The validity of a variable ␰ in describing the reaction coordinate can be checked by computing the probability distribution of the committor, p,19,20 for an ensemble in which ␰ is constrained to a certain value. This distribution, P(p;␰), gives information about how important other degrees of freedom are. For example, a distribution that is peaked around pϭ0.5 indicates that ␰ describes the transition rather well, whereas a distribution peaked at pϭ0 and pϭ1 suggests that there is an additional barrier orthogonal to ␰.19
We calculated the distribution P( pG ;n) for the drying transition for three constrained ensembles: nϭ49, nϭ50, and nϭ51. The constrained ensembles were generated by Monte Carlo simulation. The ensemble consisted of 200 conﬁgurations for each ensemble. For every conﬁguration we initiated 50 trajectories with momenta drawn from a Gaussian distribution. The total energy was again ﬁxed to E ϭϪ8000⑀. The length of each trajectory was 40 LJ time units. The results are plotted in Fig. 7. The P( pG ;n) distribution is broad for all three ensembles. For nϭ51 its average is around pGϭ0.3, indicating that the system is more likely to go to the metastable liquid state. For the nϭ49 ensemble the distribution is shifted to higher pG values, corresponding to a higher probability to end up in the vapor phase. The committor for the nϭ50 ensemble is also broadly distributed, but it is peaked around pGϭ0.5. All three distributions are peaked around a value close to pGϭ0.5. This ﬁnding suggests that a barrier associated with another parameter is likely to be small.
We also computed the committor distribution for the radius of the vapor nucleus, to test the validity of the bubble radius as a reaction coordinate. A constrained ensemble was constructed by Monte Carlo simulation for a bubble radius of rbϭ1.28␴ which corresponds to the maximum of the distribution in Fig. 5 with the same conditions as above. The committor distribution for this ensemble is also shown in Fig. 7. It is peaked around pGϭ0.5 and narrower than the corresponding distribution for the density. This result indi-

VIII. CONCLUSION
A cavitation transition of a Lennard-Jones liquid between two repulsive surfaces takes place by nucleation of a vapor bubble between the surfaces. First, a vapor bubble has to be formed by ﬂuctuations connecting the two surfaces. This bubble has to be of a critical size before it can grow to a full vapor layer. This critical vapor nucleus is the transition state.
The committor distributions indicate the same trend more clearly. The committor distribution for the radius of the nucleus is sharper peaked around pGϭ0.5 than the corresponding distribution for the density. For larger plates, this trend will be more pronounced.
A possible extension of this work involves the inclusion of moving plates. In that case the plates still have to overcome a barrier, because a nucleus has to be formed, but the distance between the plates clearly plays an additional role. Allowing the plates to move, may well lower the barrier.
The cavitation transition in a LJ ﬂuid acts as a simple model for the hydrophobic effect. An important question is if the mechanism observed here is the same for hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solution. And if so, how large is the barrier that has to be overcome, if there is a substantial barrier at all.
A more general conclusion of the current work is that we have demonstrated that it is in principle possible to study the dynamics of ﬁrst order ͑although of ﬁnite system size͒ phase transitions using the path sampling method. Other applications that involve dynamics of ﬁrst order transitions, such as the nucleation of a crystal in the melt, thus come within reach of being investigated without imposing a preconceived reaction coordinate.
