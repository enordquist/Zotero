The room-temperature X-ray structures of ubiquitin (PDB code 1ubq) and of the RNA-binding domain of nonstructural protein 1 of inﬂuenza A virus (PDB code 1ail) solved at 1.8 and 1.9 A˚ resolution, respectively, were used to investigate whether a set of conformations rather than a single X-ray structure provides better agreement with both the X-ray data and the observed 13C chemical shifts in solution. For this purpose, a set of new conformations for each of these proteins was generated by ﬁtting them to the experimental X-ray data deposited in the PDB. For each of the generated structures, which show R and Rfree factors similar to those of the deposited X-ray structure, the 13C chemical shifts of all residues in the sequence were computed at the DFT level of theory. The sets of conformations were then evaluated by their ability to reproduce the observed 13C chemical shifts by using the conformational average root-mean-square-deviation (car.m.s.d.). For ubiquitin, the computed set of conformations is a better representation of the observed 13C chemical shifts in terms of the ca-r.m.s.d. than a single X-ray-derived structure. However, for the RNA-binding domain of nonstructural protein 1 of inﬂuenza A virus, consideration of an ensemble of conformations does not improve the agreement with the observed 13C chemical shifts. Whether an ensemble of conformations rather than any single structure is a more accurate representation of a protein structure in the crystal as well as of the observed 13C chemical shifts is determined by the dispersion of coordinates, in terms of the all-atom r.m.s.d. among the generated models; these generated models satisfy the experimental X-ray data with accuracy as good as the PDB structure. Therefore, generation of an ensemble is a necessary step to determine whether or not a single structure is sufﬁcient for an accurate representation of both experimental X-ray data and observed 13C chemical shifts in solution.

1. Introduction
Structural knowledge of biological macromolecules is crucial for a full understanding of their function as well as for a number of practical applications such as protein engineering and drug design. X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are two major techniques that are used to obtain this information. Based on biophysical principles, these techniques are expected to lead to similar structures, within certain error bounds, of a given protein. However, a recent study of pairs of NMR- and X-ray-determined structures of 148 proteins (Andrec et al., 2007) showed that statistically signiﬁcant differences exist between these two types of structures. It was

solved by X-ray [PDB code 1ubq (Vijay-Kumar et al., 1987) and PDB code 1ail (Liu et al., 1997), respectively] and NMR [PDB code 1d3z (Cornilescu et al., 1998) and PDB code 1ns1 (Chien et al., 1997), respectively] methods, with the latter providing the available 13C chemical shifts.
2. Method
2.1. Model generation and refinement
The atomic structures and structure factors of 1ubq and 1ail were obtained from the PDB.
Initial models for UBQ and AIL were generated by carrying out a search with the Monte Carlo-with-Minimization (MCM) method (Li & Scheraga, 1998), starting from the corresponding regularized experimental X-ray structure, i.e. that with the bond lengths and bond angles of all residues set to the standard ECEPP/3 values (Ne´ methy et al., 1992) and kept ﬁxed (rigid geometry approximation). This rigid geometry was used only in the MCM conformational search, not in the reﬁnement against the X-ray data. During the search, variations of the (’, , ) torsional angles were allowed for all the residues in the sequence. The reported B factors were used to estimate the upper limit of the torsional angle variation (Ã). Thus, a tolerance range of Ã = Æ10 was adopted. This range of angular variation leads to a temperature factor of up to 45 A˚ 2 per residue, which is close to the largest B factors reported for either the 1ubq (Vijay-Kumar et al., 1987) or 1ail (Liu et al., 1997) structures (36 and 39 A˚ 2, respectively). The temperature factors were computed as (82)huji, with huji representing the mean-square displacement of all atoms of residue j, other than H atoms, from their mean positions.
Conformations with an all-atom r.m.s.d. of <2 A˚ from the deposited PDB structure were selected and clustered using the minimal spanning tree method (Kruskal, 1956) and by assuming a speciﬁc r.m.s.d. cutoff of 0.2 A˚ for all heavy atoms and no cutoff in energy. The resulting 18 and 11 conformations of UBQ and AIL, respectively, were chosen for further analysis.
Structure-reﬁnement and R-factor calculations for the models were performed using the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) program (Bru¨ nger et al., 1998; Brunger, 2007) with a maximum-likelihood function and Babinet bulk-solvent correction (Hodel et al., 1992). New free sets of structure factors including 10% of the reﬂections were generated to compute Rfree for both UBQ and AIL. The free sets were excluded from all reﬁnement and map calculations. B factors were reset to 20 A˚ 2 for backbone and 30 A˚ 2 for side-chain atoms at the beginning of the structure reﬁnement to eliminate bias towards the PDB structure. Water molecules were taken directly from the PDB to ensure that an equivalent number of atoms was modeled. Water atoms were allowed to move during reﬁnement.
The generated initial structures of UBQ (18) and AIL (11) were poor models of the corresponding diffraction data, with R and Rfree factors of 45–52%. Reﬁnement of these initial structures with CNS was carried out using the procedure
Acta Cryst. (2009). D65, 697–703

described by Adams et al. (1997). Initial simulated-annealing reﬁnements were repeated six times with different initial velocities. Structures with values of R < 24% and Rfree < 26% (ﬁve and three for UBQ and AIL, respectively) were selected. Simulated-annealing OMIT electron-density maps for these structures were calculated with CNS using the Babinet bulksolvent correction. The maps and the corresponding models were displayed with the molecular-graphics application Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004). Whenever it was necessary, the conformations of the side chains were corrected manually to improve the ﬁt to the electron-density distribution. Final structure reﬁnements for each of these remaining conformations were carried out by simulated annealing, repeated ten times with different initial velocities followed by B-factor reﬁnement.
The ensemble R and Rfree factors were calculated by including all the ﬁnal models (ﬁve and three for UBQ and AIL, respectively) generated for each protein using the procedure described above in a single asymmetric unit and assigning the atomic occupancies to 0.20 and 0.33 for UBQ and AIL, respectively.
Since the deposited PDB structures (1ubq and 1ail) were solved and reﬁned using software and parameters that differed from those employed in this work, reference conformations were obtained by one round of simulated annealing [simulated-annealing reﬁned (SAR) structures], starting from the original PDB structures. This reﬁnement of the PDB structures is also a necessary step for consistent comparison between the chemical shifts of the generated models and the PDB structure, because 13C chemical shifts are very sensitive to small differences in bond lengths and bond angles (deDios et al., 1993).
To assess the stereochemical quality of the models, measures such as the r.m.s.d. of bond lengths and bond angles, the ’/ compatibility with the Ramachandran plot (Lovell et al., 2003) and the number of unfavorable contacts were employed. Ramachandran outliers were calculated with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993).
2.2. Calculation of 13Ca chemical shifts
The 13C chemical shifts were computed using the methodology described in a recently published paper (Vila, Villegas et al., 2007) and hence only the most essential information is provided here.
The 13C chemical shifts for each conformation were computed with the following approximations: (i) each aminoacid residue X in the protein sequence was treated as a terminally blocked tripeptide with sequence Ac-GXG-NMe, with X in the conformation of the protein structure, and (ii) the 13C isotropic shielding values () for each amino-acid residue X were computed at the OB98/6–311+G(2d,p) level of theory (Vila et al., 2009) with the Gaussian03 package (Frisch et al., 2004). The remaining residues in each tripeptide were treated at the OB98/3-21G level of theory, i.e. by using the locally dense basis set approach (Chesnut & Moore, 1989). All

3.2. The RNA-binding domain of nonstructural protein 1 of influenza A virus
This protein was solved at 1.9 A˚ resolution (Liu et al., 1997) as a single conformation with isotropic B factors (PDB code 1ail). The Rfree values of our three models are 0.1–0.6% higher than those of the SAR PDB structure (Table 2). The B factors of the SAR PDB structure and the three models listed in Table 2 are almost identical (see Fig. 5a), with a correlation coefﬁcient of $0.99 among them.

All three models in Table 2 as well as the reﬁned PDB structure have very similar stereochemical quality, as seen from their r.m.s.d. in bond lengths and bond angles, ’/ compatibility with the Ramachandran plot and the number of unfavorable contacts (Table 2). All the models have no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot and can be considered as equivalent solutions for the content of the protein crystal.
The alternative conformations exhibited little variance from the PDB structure or among themselves (Fig. 6). Thus, the allatom r.m.s.d. of the new models from the SAR PDB structure is 0.19–0.68 A˚ (Table 2), which is almost two times lower than

The results obtained for UBQ and AIL represent two different examples for a number of reasons. Firstly, the number of X-ray-derived conformations for each of them is different and shows a different dispersion of all-atom (and backbone) r.m.s.d. between the models (Tables 1 and 2, and

Figs. 3 and 5). Thus, three models of AIL possess almost identical backbone conformations. The dispersion of all-atom (and backbone) r.m.s.d. between the UBQ models remains almost two times greater than the corresponding dispersion for AIL, even after removal of the most ﬂexible C-terminal residues from the r.m.s.d. calculations for both proteins (results not shown). Secondly, the ca-r.m.s.d. of the UBQ ensemble is lower than that for any individual model, including the SAR PDB structure. On the other hand, the SAR PDB structure of AIL exhibits a better 13C chemicalshift r.m.s.d. than either the ensemble or any generated model. These results may indicate different dynamics of these two proteins in both solution and crystal. The origin of this difference may lie in the ﬂexibility of these two proteins resulting from the signiﬁcantly different number of residues in secondary structure, namely 80% and 57% for 1ail and 1ubq, respectively. It should be mentioned that crystal structures of both proteins were solved at the same temperature and have very similar solvent content ($33%). From this point of view, AIL seems to be more rigid than UBQ and therefore a single SAR PDB structure of AIL is a suitable representation of the observed 13C chemical shifts in solution.
4. Conclusions
Recent work on X-ray protein structure determination (DePristo et al., 2004; Furnham et al., 2006) suggested that an ensemble of conformations is a more suitable representation of a protein crystal structure than a single model. The results of our analysis of the observed and computed 13C chemical shifts for different X-ray-derived models of UBQ are in agreement with this suggestion. However, if the ensemble of derived models is very tight, as for AIL, a single model would be a suitable representation of the observed 13C chemical shifts in solution and the experimental X-ray data.
In the absence of observed 13C chemical shifts, the formulation of accurate criteria to decide whether an ensemble or a single conformation should be reported as a solution for the X-ray diffraction data will require further analysis of a larger number of X-ray-derived proteins displaying a variety of secondary-structure contents, threedimensional motifs and crystal packings. Analysis of these criteria will be a topic of future work.
