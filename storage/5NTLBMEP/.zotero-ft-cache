SUMMARY
Cellular chaperone networks prevent potentially toxic protein aggregation and ensure proteome integrity. Here, we used Escherichia coli as a model to understand the organization of these networks, focusing on the cooperation of the DnaK system with the upstream chaperone Trigger factor (TF) and the downstream GroEL. Quantitative proteomics revealed that DnaK interacts with at least $700 mostly cytosolic proteins, including $180 relatively aggregation-prone proteins that utilize DnaK extensively during and after initial folding. Upon deletion of TF, DnaK interacts increasingly with ribosomal and other small, basic proteins, while its association with large multidomain proteins is reduced. DnaK also functions prominently in stabilizing proteins for subsequent folding by GroEL. These proteins accumulate on DnaK upon GroEL depletion and are then degraded, thus deﬁning DnaK as a central organizer of the chaperone network. Combined loss of DnaK and TF causes proteostasis collapse with disruption of GroEL function, defective ribosomal biogenesis, and extensive aggregation of large proteins.
INTRODUCTION
In all cell types, molecular chaperones function in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, typically by shielding hydrophobic surfaces exposed by proteins in their non-native states. Chaperones have essential roles in assisting the folding, assembly and transport of newly synthesized polypeptides and in surveying the conformational status of preexistent proteins (Hartl and Hayer-Hartl, 2009). Although detailed insights into the structure and mechanism of individual chaperone components have been obtained in recent years, how multiple chaperone modules cooperate to maintain conformational proteome integrity (proteostasis) is not yet understood (Balch et al., 2008).

What is the degree of functional overlap and speciﬁcity among chaperones, and how robust is the network in tolerating disturbances and avoiding collapse? Although there is evidence that the complexity of proteostasis networks has increased during evolution (Gidalevitz et al., 2011), central players, such as the ATP-regulated Hsp70 chaperones, have been highly conserved from bacteria to human. Here we employed quantitative proteomics to analyze the chaperone network of Escherichia coli as a tractable model, focusing on the central role of the Hsp70 system.
DnaK, the major bacterial Hsp70, is one of the most abundant constitutively expressed and stress inducible chaperones in the E. coli cytosol. Yet it is not essential under nonstress conditions at intermediate temperature (Bukau and Walker, 1989). Indeed, DnaK (together with its co-chaperone DnaJ and regulator GrpE) cooperates in de novo protein folding with the ribosomebound chaperone Trigger factor (TF). Although DnaK and TF can be deleted individually, their simultaneous deletion results in synthetic lethality at temperatures above 30C (Deuerling et al., 1999; Genevaux et al., 2004; Teter et al., 1999). Under stress conditions, such as heat shock at 42C, DnaK becomes indispensable (Bukau and Walker, 1989). TF and DnaK act upstream of the essential GroEL/ES chaperonin, which provides a cage-like compartment for the folding of single protein molecules, unimpaired by aggregation. About 10% of cytosolic proteins ($250 different proteins) have been found to interact with GroEL, of which a subset of $50À85 proteins (so-called class III substrates) are absolutely GroEL/ES dependent for folding (Fujiwara et al., 2010; Kerner et al., 2005).
The ATP-dependent reaction cycle of DnaK is regulated by the Hsp40 co-chaperone DnaJ and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE (reviewed in Hartl et al., 2011; Mayer, 2010). DnaJ functions in presenting non-native substrate proteins to DnaK (Figure 1A). Substrate binding and release by Hsp70 is achieved through the allosteric coupling of a N-terminal ATPase domain with a C-terminal peptide-binding domain, the latter consisting of a b sandwich subdomain and an a-helical lid segment. The b sandwich recognizes extended, $7 residue segments enriched with hydrophobic amino acids, preferentially when they are framed by positively charged residues (Ru¨ diger et al., 1997; Zhu et al.,

1996). The a-helical lid and a conformational change in the b sandwich domain regulate the afﬁnity state for peptide through an ATP-dependent, allosteric mechanism (Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2011). In the ATP-bound state, the lid adopts an open conformation, resulting in high on- and off-rates for peptide (Figure 1A). Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is accelerated by DnaJ, leading to lid closure and stable peptide binding. Following ATP-hydrolysis, DnaJ dissociates and GrpE binds to the DnaK ATPase domain, catalyzing ADP release. Binding of ATP then results in lid-opening and substrate release for folding or transfer to other chaperones (Figure 1A).
Attempts to identify DnaK substrates have been limited to the analysis of proteins that aggregated in cells lacking TF upon depletion of DnaK (Deuerling et al., 2003). Here we developed an approach for the direct isolation of DnaK-substrate complexes and their identiﬁcation by quantitative proteomics from wild-type, TF-deleted, or GroEL-depleted cells. In parallel, we analyzed global proteome changes under conditions of single or combined chaperone deletion. Our measurements show that DnaK normally interacts with at least $700 newly synthesized and preexistent proteins, which we characterized based on their relative enrichment on DnaK. Individual deletion of TF or depletion of GroEL/ES leads to speciﬁc changes in the DnaK interactome and in global proteome composition. These effects are highly informative as to the functional cooperativity of chaperone modules. We conclude that DnaK is the central hub in the cytosolic E. coli chaperone network, interfacing extensively with the upstream TF and the downstream chaperonin. The functional interconnection of these major chaperone systems is critical for robust proteostasis control.
RESULTS
Isolation and Identiﬁcation of the DnaK Interactome To isolate DnaK-substrate complexes, we generated an E. coli MC4100 strain in which the wild-type dnaK gene was replaced by dnaK-His6, encoding DnaK with a C-terminal His6-tag (henceforth called KHis). KHis cells grew like wild-type (WT) on agar plates or in liquid culture at 30CÀ37C, or under heat shock conditions at 42C (Figure 1B and Figure S1A available online). Quantitative proteomic analysis using SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) (Ong et al., 2002) did not detect signiﬁcant differences in protein abundance between WT and KHis cells (Figure S1B). DnaK-His6 also supported normal growth of TF-deleted (DT) cells above 30C and of cells lacking the protein export chaperone SecB (DB) (Figure 1B and Figure S1A) (Deuerling et al., 1999; Genevaux et al., 2004; Smock et al., 2010; Teter et al., 1999). DB cells are cold-sensitive and this defect is compensated by deletion of TF (Ullers et al., 2007).
We isolated DnaK interactors by immobilized metal afﬁnity chromatography (IMAC) from KHis cells growing exponentially at 37C. DnaK-substrate complexes were stabilized during cell lysis by rapidly (within <10 s) depleting ATP with apyrase to inhibit substrate cycling (Figure 1A) (Teter et al., 1999). The KHis cells were SILAC-labeled with medium (M) Arg/Lys isotopes, lysate prepared and subjected to IMAC pulldown (PD). DnaKHis6 complexes were mixed 1:1 with a background (BG) sample

obtained by the same IMAC procedure from lysate of unlabeled WT cells (light isotopes, L) (Figure 1C and Extended Experimental Procedures). The composition of PD and BG samples prior to mixing is shown in Figure 1D. Note that GrpE was co-isolated with DnaK as a stoichiometric complex (Figures 1A and 1D), whereas DnaJ was present in substoichiometric amounts (Table S1). The molar ratio of DnaK/GrpE/DnaJ was $30:20:1, as estimated from the number of peptides identiﬁed by MS using exponentially modiﬁed Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) scores (Ishihama et al., 2005).
A total of 674 DnaK interactors (Table S1) were identiﬁed by LC-MS/MS with >95% conﬁdence (Figure S1C and Extended Experimental Procedures), including proteins either not identiﬁed in BG samples or having a >2-fold enrichment (M/L ratio) in PD over BG in at least two of three independent experiments (biological repeats). Most of these (503 proteins) were >4-fold enriched over BG (Table S1). The identiﬁcation of DnaK interactors approached saturation in consecutive experiments (Extended Experimental Procedures). For the vast majority of interactors (>95%), the amount of protein co-isolated with DnaK was strongly diminished upon incubation of cell lysate with ATP (Figure S1D), indicating that these proteins bind DnaK in an ATP-regulated manner. While GrpE was released, DnaJ was enriched on DnaK in the presence of ATP (data not shown) (Figure 1A). The DnaJ homolog cbpA and the two small heat shock proteins, IbpA and IbpB (Hsp20), were also identiﬁed in DnaK pulldowns in the presence of ATP, suggesting that these chaperones functionally cooperate with DnaK (data not shown).
Approximately 80% of the DnaK interactors are predicted to be cytosolic, $11% are inner membrane proteins, $3% outer membrane proteins, and $3% are located in the periplasm (Figure 1E and Table S1). Thus, the identiﬁed DnaK interactors comprise $25% of the cytosolic proteome. As a collective, they are similar to a set of 1,938 proteins identiﬁed in soluble cell lysates (list available at the Proteome Commons Tranche repository) in terms of molecular weight (Figure S1E) and other physico-chemical properties, such as isoelectric point, average hydrophobicity, and aggregation propensity (data not shown), indicating that DnaK has a broad substrate speciﬁcity.
Classiﬁcation of DnaK Substrates by Enrichment on DnaK We next analyzed each of the different DnaK interactors to determine what fraction of the total protein is DnaK-bound, assuming that this parameter correlates with chaperone dependence, as was observed for the substrates of GroEL (Kerner et al., 2005). Unlabeled soluble cell lysate (L) was mixed at a deﬁned proportion with DnaK complexes isolated from cells labeled with heavy Arg/Lys isotopes (H) and H/L ratios were determined by LC-MS/ MS. H/L ratios were obtained for 666 DnaK interactors, reﬂecting their relative enrichment on DnaK. The relative enrichment factors (REF) displayed a broad, bimodal distribution (Figure 2A). By setting thresholds at the 20th and 70th percentiles of the distribution, we grouped 142 proteins as less-enriched, 183 proteins as enriched, and 341 proteins as medium enriched on DnaK (Figure 2A and Table S1). Interestingly, the enriched proteins are below average in cellular abundance but together make up $40% of all identiﬁed DnaK interactors by mass

interactors amount to $47% of all DnaK interactors by mass, with $1% of cellular content being bound.
The DnaK-enriched proteins cover a wide range of cellular functions, prominently including DNA replication, recombination and repair (COG class L), and cell division and chromosome partitioning (COG class D) (Figure S2A and Table S1). The lessenriched DnaK interactors have a signiﬁcant preference for proteins involved in translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis (COG class J) and include 24 ribosomal proteins. Essential proteins (Gerdes et al., 2003) are more frequent among the less-enriched substrates (Figure S2B). The enriched interactors include some very large proteins >100 kDa (Figure S2C) and tend to have more predicted DnaK binding sites than the less enriched substrates (both absolute and when corrected for size) (Figure S2D) (Van Durme et al., 2009). Furthermore, they are more frequently part of heterooligomeric complexes (when ribosomal proteins are considered separately) (Figure 2C).
To determine whether the proteins enriched on DnaK have a high propensity to aggregate, we took advantage of the study by Niwa et al. (2009) who analyzed the solubility of E. coli proteins upon in vitro translation in the absence of chaperones. Indeed, the DnaK-enriched proteins are more aggregation prone upon translation than average proteins of soluble cell lysate, whereas the less-enriched DnaK interactors are more soluble (Figure 2D). This is consistent with the ﬁnding that the enriched proteins frequently display pI values close to neutral pH (Figure S2E). Moreover, these proteins are predicted to bury amino acid residues less effectively from solvent than the less enriched DnaK interactors and average soluble proteins (Figure 2E) (Tartaglia et al., 2010). This suggests that the enriched interactors populate dynamic intermediate states during folding and expose hydrophobic residues, although their average sequence hydrophobicity is not increased (data not shown). Similar properties were previously found for the obligate (class III) GroEL substrates (Figure 2E) (Raineri et al., 2010; Tartaglia et al., 2010). Interestingly, $18% (29 proteins) of the DnaK-enriched substrates with assigned fold (159 proteins) contain at least one domain with SCOP fold c.37 (P loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases), compared to only $8% of soluble lysate proteins and $3% of the less-enriched DnaK interactors (Figure 2F). The c.37 fold is characterized by a complex a/b topology and is highly represented in heterooligomeric proteins (Figure S2F). The less-enriched substrates have a preference for the SCOP folds c.2 (NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold) and b.40 (OB-fold) (Figure 2F), which are found in abundant metabolic enzymes and in ribosomal proteins, respectively.
In summary, the relative enrichment of proteins on DnaK correlates with their propensity to aggregate during folding. The $180 most enriched DnaK interactors amount to $40% of total mass of DnaK substrates. They are of relatively low cellular abundance, tend to contain more predicted DnaK binding sites than the less-enriched interactors, and frequently assemble with other proteins to heterooligomeric complexes.
Effects of DnaK Deletion at the Proteome Level To analyze the global effects of deleting the DnaK chaperone system, we performed quantitative proteomics of DdnaKdnaJ (DKJ) cells (H-labeled) in comparison to KHis cells (M-labeled).

The cells were grown at 30C where deletion of DnaK/DnaJ is well tolerated in liquid culture (Figure 1B and Figure S1A). Out of $1,400 proteins quantiﬁed, 105 proteins were increased in abundance in DKJ cells (Table S2A). These proteins include 42 identiﬁed DnaK interactors, presumably reﬂecting a compensatory response. In addition, the major cytosolic chaperones and proteases (GroEL/ES, HtpG, IbpA, IbpB, ClpB, Hsp33, HslU, HslV, Lon) were upregulated 5- to >10-fold, consistent with a 4.5-fold increase in abundance of the central heat shock regulator rpoH (s32), which is negatively controlled by DnaK and DnaJ (Table S1) (Gamer et al., 1992; Straus et al., 1990). Indeed, the genes of 56 of the 105 upregulated proteins contain known or putative s32 binding sites in their upstream regions (Zhao et al., 2005) (Table S2A). Interestingly, 87 proteins were reproducibly reduced in abundance in DKJ cells by $40%À95% (median 60%; p < 0.05) (Table S2B). SILAC pulse-labeling demonstrated similar rates of synthesis in KHis and DKJ cells (Figure S2G), indicating that the observed decrease in protein abundance was largely due to degradation. Notably, among the degraded proteins were 40 identiﬁed DnaK interactors (four essential proteins), including the periplasmic chaperones of acid-denatured proteins hdeA and hdeB, and several amino acid metabolic enzymes. The DnaK interactors that are degraded in DKJ cells are above average enriched on DnaK in DnaK-His6 cells (Table S2B) and exhibit relatively low solubility upon in vitro translation (Figure S2H) (Niwa et al., 2009).
To determine whether proteins aggregate in cells lacking DnaK/DnaJ, we analyzed the insoluble and soluble fractions of DKJ cells compared to KHis cells. In total, 474 proteins were signiﬁcantly increased in the insoluble fraction of DKJ cells, including 201 identiﬁed DnaK interactors (Table S3). However, only 65 proteins were substantially depleted from the soluble fraction by 5%À90% (median $9%; p < 0.05) due to aggregation. Among this group of proteins were 30 identiﬁed DnaK interactors (eight essential proteins), such as excision nuclease subunit A (uvrA) (Table S3). The extent of aggregation correlated strongly with enrichment on DnaK (Table S3).
These ﬁndings demonstrate that a subset of DnaK interactors are speciﬁcally dependent on the DnaK system in vivo. These proteins tend to be degraded or aggregate in DKJ cells, even at a growth temperature of 30C, where the loss of DnaK is otherwise well compensated.
DnaK Interacts with Newly Synthesized and Preexistent Proteins To determine whether proteins interact with DnaK only during initial folding or return to DnaK later for conformational maintenance (newly synthesized and preexistent interactors, respectively), we performed pulse-SILAC experiments. KHis cells grown at 37C with unlabeled Arg/Lys (L) were shifted to M-labeled Arg/Lys for 2.5 min to label newly synthesized polypeptides. WT cells grown in heavy (H) Arg/Lys served as background control. Lysates from the KHis and WT cells were mixed 1:1 and DnaK interactors identiﬁed. The M/L ratio of a DnaK interactor relative to its M/L ratio in the lysate (the latter correcting for rates of synthesis and turnover) was used to indicate whether it bound to DnaK preferentially as a newly synthesized or preexistent protein (Figure 3A). Isotope ratios were obtained

for $300 DnaK interactors (Table S4). Log10 M/L ratios lower than 0, indicating a strong preference for interaction as preexistent protein, were observed for only 20 interactors (Figure 3A, green). Most other proteins bound to DnaK upon synthesis (Figure 3A, gray and blue), including $100 proteins with a strong preference for interaction as newly synthesized polypeptides (log10 M/L ratio R 1) (Figure 3A, blue). Ribosomal proteins are included in this group (Figure 3A, yellow), in support of the proposed role of DnaK in ribosome assembly (Maki et al., 2002; Rene´ and Alix, 2011).
We next compared the physico-chemical properties of the newly synthesized and preexistent DnaK interactors (Figure 3A). Ribosomal proteins were analyzed separately, as their unusual size and charge properties would introduce a strong bias. Interestingly, the 71 proteins with a strong preference to interact with DnaK upon synthesis are signiﬁcantly shifted to large sizes and thus are likely to have complex folding pathways (Figure 3B). They are of average to above average cellular abundance and

comparable to lysate proteins in terms of hydrophobicity and aggregation propensities, as calculated with the Zagg algorithm based on their amino acid sequence properties (Tartaglia et al., 2008) (Figures S3A and S3B). Interestingly, only a few of these proteins aggregated in DKJ cells (Table S3), suggesting that they can utilize multiple chaperones for folding or, perhaps less likely, have only low chaperone dependence. As expected, the ribosomal proteins have very low aggregation scores, consistent with their charge character (Figure S3B). Furthermore, the tendency to interact with DnaK upon synthesis correlates with a relatively lower enrichment on DnaK, suggesting that these proteins interact only transiently (Figure 3C). On the other hand, the preexistent interactors are similar in size to the average of lysate proteins (Figure 3B) and are more enriched on DnaK than the newly synthesized substrates (Figure 3C), arguing for longer residence times on DnaK. They are also characterized by higher intrinsic aggregation propensities than the newly synthesized interactors (p < 0.05) (Figure S3B) and several of

Error bars represent SD of three independent measurements.

these proteins were found to be degraded in DKJ cells (Table S2B). Thus, a prominent feature of the preexistent interactors is their intrinsic tendency to populate aggregation-prone states, consistent with a requirement for conformational maintenance by DnaK.
Protein Flux through DnaK To measure the residence time of interactors on DnaK directly, KHis cells were pulse-labeled with Arg/Lys isotopes (H) for 2.5 min, followed by a chase with excess unlabeled amino acids (L). Time course data based on the time-dependent decrease of the H/L ratio were collected for 91 proteins, with apparent dissociation rates from DnaK corresponding to halftimes of $30 s to $25 min (Figure 3D and Table S5). Proteins with slow release rates (%30th percentile of the rate distribution; 27 proteins) include GroEL, IbpA, and SecB, presumably reﬂecting the functional cooperation of these chaperones with DnaK. Slow releasing proteins (excluding chaperones) are characterized by above average enrichment on DnaK and an average number of predicted binding sites compared to all DnaK interactors (Figure 3E). Proteins with fast release rates (R70th percentile of the rate distribution; 27 proteins) display

average enrichment on DnaK and tend to have a lower number of binding sites (Figure 3E). Most of these substrates are predicted to bury hydrophobic regions effectively (data not shown). Thus, the residence time (and consequently the enrichment) on DnaK appears to be regulated, at least in part, by the frequency of potential DnaK recognition motifs in the polypeptide chain and by the efﬁciency of their burial during folding. Fast release rates correlate generally with the tendency of proteins to interact with DnaK only upon synthesis, whereas proteins that utilize DnaK also for maintenance have longer residence times.
Partial Functional Redundancy of DnaK and TF To understand how DnaK interfaces with other modules of the chaperone network, we ﬁrst investigated how the DnaK interactome changes upon deletion of the upstream chaperone TF. We identiﬁed the DnaK interactors in the TF deletion strain at 37C by pulldown from H-labeled Dtig/dnaK-His6 (DT/KHis) cells using L-labeled DT cells as the background. The number of identiﬁed DnaK interactors increased to 998 (see Proteome Commons Tranche repository), including $95% of the 672 DnaK interactors identiﬁed in KHis cells (Figure 4A). (DnaK levels increased $1.4-fold in DT/KHis cells; see Table S6D below.) The additional

proteins have physico-chemical properties similar to the DnaK interactors in WT cells (data not shown). To detect quantitative changes in the DnaK interactome upon TF deletion, we performed a comparative analysis of H-labeled DT/KHis and M-labeled KHis cells. Seventy-one proteins interacted to a significantly greater extent (1.4- to 3.3-fold) and 74 proteins to a lesser extent with DnaK in DT/KHis cells (Tables S6A and S6B). The proteins accumulating on DnaK are typically small in size (<20 kDa) (Figure 4B) and include 17 highly basic ribosomal proteins as well as ten basic nonribosomal proteins (pI R 9) (Figure 4C), such as several secretory proteins with functions in cell envelope and outer membrane biogenesis (Skp, AmpH, YcgK, SlyB) (Table S6A). The proteins that interacted less extensively with DnaK in DT/KHis cells are larger in size (Figure 4B) and overlap with the large newly synthesized DnaK interactors described above (Figure 3B). Apparently, they bind to DnaK less efﬁciently in the absence of TF (Figure 4B).
We also performed a proteomic analysis of total cell lysate of DT/KHis cells as compared to KHis cells. Only 40 of 1,490 quantiﬁed proteins were reproducibly reduced in abundance by 25%À 85% (p < 0.05) when TF was deleted (Table S6C), although their rates of synthesis were unchanged (Figure S4); 27 proteins were increased in abundance (Figure 4D and Table S6D). Both these groups of proteins show minimal overlap with the proteins that accumulated on DnaK upon TF deletion (Figure 4D). Strikingly, most of the proteins that decreased in DT/KHis cells carry predicted signal sequences (Table S6C). These proteins include numerous outer membrane b-barrel proteins, suggesting that TF has a speciﬁc role in outer membrane protein biogenesis. Indeed, DT/KHis cells proved to be sensitive to treatment with detergents like deoxycholate and the antibiotic vancomycin, which is indicative of a weakening of the outer membrane (Figure 4E) (Nichols et al., 2011). The proteins that increased in DT/KHis cells include cytosolic chaperones and proteases, as well as the ATPase SecA required for membrane translocation of outer membrane proteins (Table S6D). However, these proteins are only moderately upregulated ($1.5-fold), suggesting that loss of TF function at 37C causes only limited proteome stress.
These results indicate a functional redundancy of TF and DnaK in the folding/assembly of ribosomal and other small, basic proteins. In addition, TF has a speciﬁc role in the biogenesis of outer membrane b-barrel proteins. This function cannot be performed by DnaK and is only partially replaced by other chaperones, resulting in outer membrane destabilization.
Interplay of DnaK and GroEL/ES GroEL and its cofactor GroES are upregulated in both the DKJ and DT/KHis cells (Tables S2 and S6D), suggesting that these chaperone systems form a functional network. Strikingly, 119 of the identiﬁed DnaK interactors are known GroEL substrates (Fujiwara et al., 2010; Kerner et al., 2005), and together these proteins amount to $30% of all DnaK interactors by mass. The number of GroEL substrates on DnaK increases to 152 in DT/KHis cells (Figure 5A, Table S1, and Proteome Commons Tranche repository). Forty-two of these DnaK interactors are obligate GroEL-dependent (class III) and thus must be delivered to GroEL for folding, whereas 80 belong to class II and 30 to class

I (Figure 5B). Class II substrates are highly chaperone dependent but can utilize either GroEL/ES or DnaK/DnaJ for folding in vitro, whereas class I proteins have a lower chaperone dependence (Kerner et al., 2005). About 90 of the previously identiﬁed GroEL substrates were not detected on DnaK. Many of these proteins are of low abundance and thus may have very low steady-state levels on DnaK.
To investigate how the depletion of GroEL/ES affects the spectrum of DnaK interactors, KHis cells carrying the groELS operon under arabinose control were shifted from arabinose (LS+/KHis) to glucose for 3.5 hr (LSÀ/KHis) at 37C, which resulted in $97% depletion of GroEL/ES (Kerner et al., 2005; McLennan and Masters, 1998). Note that the cells grow normally during the ﬁrst 5 hr of GroEL/ES depletion (data not shown). Ninety-two proteins increased on DnaK (2- to 60-fold) upon GroEL depletion and 54 proteins decreased (Tables S7A and S7B). The former include 38 GroEL substrates (19 class III proteins) (Figure 5B). They are enriched in domains with SCOP fold c.1 (TIM-barrel) (Figure S5A), which is prominently represented among obligate GroEL substrates (Fujiwara et al., 2010; Kerner et al., 2005) (Table S7A). The proteins depleted from DnaK include 11 GroEL substrates, mostly of class II (Table S7B), suggesting that they are partially displaced from DnaK by class III substrates that are unable to fold.
We also analyzed the consequences of GroEL depletion at the proteome level. Depletion of GroEL resulted in a $35%À95% decrease in abundance of 114 proteins and a R2-fold increase of 95 proteins (Tables S7C and S7D). The former include 44 GroEL substrates (24 class III proteins) (Figure 5B and Table S7C) that are apparently degraded (Figure S5B). Strikingly, 18 of these GroEL substrates nevertheless accumulated on DnaK (Figure 5C), suggesting that they are stabilized by DnaK for transfer to the degradation machinery. The proteins that are upregulated upon GroEL depletion include chaperones and proteases (upregulated $2-fold) as well as 19 GroEL substrates (Table S7C). In addition to degradation, loss of GroEL function at 37C also resulted in substantial aggregation of many obligate GroEL substrates (Figure 5D) (Chapman et al., 2006; Kerner et al., 2005).
In summary, GroEL substrates interact extensively with DnaK. Upon depletion of GroEL, obligate GroEL substrates accumulate further on DnaK and are either transferred to the degradation machinery or eventually aggregate.
Proteostasis Collapse upon Combined Deletion of DnaK and TF Prevention of protein aggregation is considered fundamental to proteostasis maintenance (Hartl et al., 2011). To deﬁne the relative contribution of the different chaperone systems to aggregation prevention, we performed a comparative analysis of the aggregated proteomes upon individual and combined chaperone deletion at 30C, where cells lacking DnaK/DnaJ and TF (DKJT) still grow, albeit slowly (Figure 1B and Figure S1A). As described above, 474 proteins increased signiﬁcantly in the insoluble fraction of DKJ cells, compared to only 15 proteins in DT/KHis cells and 33 proteins in GroEL/ES depleted (LSÀ/KHis) cells (Figure 6A and Table S8), indicating a major role of the DnaK system in aggregation prevention. Upon combined deletion of DnaK/DnaJ and TF, 1,087 proteins aggregated, including 403 DnaK interactors identiﬁed in this study (Figure 6A and

Table S8). The aggregated proteins also included 149 of a total of 196 proteins shown previously to aggregate in cells lacking DnaK/DnaJ and TF (Deuerling et al., 2003; Martinez-Hackert and Hendrickson, 2009). Moreover, whereas in DKJ cells only 65 proteins aggregated substantially (>5% depletion from the soluble fraction), the number of substantially aggregated proteins increased 4-fold upon additional loss of TF (Figure 6A and Table S8). Strikingly, the size distribution of these proteins showed a strong shift to large proteins >50 KDa, frequently containing multiple domains (Figure 6B and Table S8). Many of these proteins ($50%) are identiﬁed DnaK substrates of average or above average abundance (Table S1) and represent a subset of the large proteins that interact with DnaK on synthesis (Figure 3B). Apparently, these proteins are chaperone-dependent but can utilize either the DnaK system or TF for efﬁcient folding.
Remarkably, $70% of the previously identiﬁed GroEL substrates (167 proteins) (Kerner et al., 2005) were also recovered in the aggregate fraction of DKJT cells (Figure 6A), many of which aggregated substantially (Table S8). This effect was observed despite a $10-fold upregulation of GroEL/ES (data not shown). Aggregation of GroEL substrates was essentially undetectable in DKJ or DT/KHis cells at 30C (Table S8). Thus, substrate delivery to GroEL critically depends on the upstream chaperones but can be performed by either DnaK or TF.
A large number of ribosomal proteins also accumulated in the insoluble fraction of DKJT cells, almost all of which were identi-

ﬁed as DnaK interactors (Table S8). Deletion of DnaK/DnaJ alone resulted in the aggregation of only three ribosomal proteins, whereas none of these proteins aggregated in the DT/KHis cells. Although aggregation did not cause a signiﬁcant depletion of ribosomal proteins from the soluble fraction, these results suggested that DKJT cells have a defect in ribosomal biogenesis. Indeed, numerous ribosomal proteins were reduced in abundance by 10%À30% in total lysates of DKJT cells compared to KHis cells and the single chaperone deletions (Figure 6C). Interestingly, two small ribosomal proteins (RpsQ S17 and RpsT S20) were increased in abundance, an effect that was also detected in DKJ cells (Figure 6C).
In summary, the combined loss of DnaK/DnaJ and TF results in a pronounced proteostasis collapse characterized by the aggregation of large, multidomain proteins, disruption of proper protein ﬂux through GroEL/ES and defective ribosomal biogenesis. These ﬁndings explain the strong growth defect of DKJT cells at 30C and their inability to grow at higher temperatures.

Figure 6. Proteostasis Collapse in DdnaKdnaJ/Dtig Cells (A) Protein aggregation in DKJ, DT/KHis, LSÀ/KHis, and DKJT cells. The number of aggregated proteins were analyzed according to the following categories: total, aggregated to >5% (Total > 5%), essential proteins aggregated to >5% (Essential > 5%), DnaK interactors, DnaK interactors aggregated to >5% and GroEL substrates. (B) Size distribution of >5% aggregated proteins in DKJ and DKJT cells in comparison to soluble lysate proteins of WT cells. (C) Changes in abundance of small and large ribosomal proteins in DKJ, DT/KHis, and DKJT relative to KHis cells. SILAC ratios (mutant/KHis) are shown with standard deviations from three independent experiments for 21 small and 31 large ribosomal proteins.

majority of DnaK substrates ($80%) are cytosolic, DnaK also interacts with a small subset of proteins of the inner membrane, periplasm and outer membrane. Under conditions of exponential cell growth at 37C, proteins bind to DnaK preferentially upon synthesis and may return to DnaK during their life time for conformational maintenance.
The dependence of proteins on DnaK for folding or maintenance is partially buffered by TF and other chaperones, but is reﬂected by the relative enrichment of substrates on DnaK. By measuring for each protein the fraction of total that is chaperone-bound, we deﬁned a set of $180 interactors that are highly enriched on DnaK and amount to about 40% of the total mass of DnaK substrates. DnaK-enriched proteins are generally of average or below average cellular abundance and of low solubility. Essential proteins are underrepresented among this group. DnaK dependence tends to correlate with the number of predicted DnaK binding sites in polypeptide sequences, and the propensity of proteins to populate structurally dynamic intermediates. Moreover, proteins that interact extensively with DnaK are often part of heterooligomeric complexes (Figure 7A).
Our ﬁndings suggest that proteins of lower abundance are frequently prone to misfolding or aggregation and thus have high chaperone requirements (with dependence on a speciﬁc

chaperone system), whereas the folding properties of abundant (and often essential) proteins have been optimized in evolution, resulting in a reduced (or less speciﬁc) chaperone requirement. This is consistent with the existence of a negative correlation between the calculated aggregation-propensity of proteins and their cellular abundance (Tartaglia et al., 2010; Tartaglia et al., 2007). Indeed, the less abundant, DnaK-enriched substrates are aggregation-prone upon translation in vitro (Niwa et al., 2009) and are either degraded or aggregate in the absence of DnaK in vivo, reﬂecting their speciﬁc requirement for DnaK for folding and conformational maintenance. Interestingly, several DnaK-enriched substrates contain at least one domain with SCOP fold c.37 (Figure 7A). Proteins with this and other complex a/b topologies have to form many long-range interactions during folding and are thus likely to populate dynamic folding intermediates exposing hydrophobic residues (Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2004). Moreover, proteins with c.37 domains often assemble into heterooligomeric complexes (Figure S2G), a process that may be facilitated by DnaK’s ability to bind partially structured protein regions in addition to extended peptide segments (Schlecht et al., 2011). On the other hand, many large proteins of higher cellular abundance but lower enrichment on DnaK are adapted to utilize either DnaK or TF for de novo folding. These

The sensitivity of DdnaK cells to antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis (Nichols et al., 2011) would correlate with the extensive interaction of DnaK with ribosomal proteins and the degradation in DKJ cells of several DnaK interactors of COG class E (amino acid transport and metabolism). Finally, the sensitivity of DdnaK cells to acidic conditions (Nichols et al., 2011) is consistent with the 80%À97% degradation in DKJ cells of the periplasmic chaperones of acid-denatured proteins, hdeA, and hdeB.

proteins aggregate substantially only in the absence of both chaperones, deﬁning sequence length, and hence multidomain topology, as a property strongly correlated with chaperone dependence.
Proteins with essential functions are underrepresented among the DnaK-enriched substrates. However, our identiﬁcation of the essential tubulin homolog, FtsZ, and the cooperating MinCDE proteins as strong DnaK binders (Table S1) would explain why DnaK mutant cells have defects in cell division (Bukau and Walker, 1989). Furthermore, the sensitivity of DdnaK cells to antibiotics causing DNA damage (Nichols et al., 2011) is consistent with the ﬁnding that proteins of COG class L (DNA replication, recombination and repair), such as the nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA, are overrepresented among the DnaK-enriched substrates (Figure S2). UvrA is a large, heterooligomeric protein with two c.37 domains; which aggregates to

Interplay between Chaperone Modules Our analysis of the DnaK interactome in cells lacking TF or depleted of GroEL/ES underscores the signiﬁcance of DnaK as a central hub in the chaperone network. The observed accumulation of a subset of proteins on DnaK in the absence of TF deﬁnes in a quantitative manner the functional redundancy between these two chaperone systems described earlier (Deuerling et al., 1999; Teter et al., 1999). Interestingly, these substrates comprise mostly ribosomal and other small (<20 kDa), positively charged proteins (Figure 7B), which may normally interact predominantly with TF, but shift to DnaK when TF is absent. Indeed, TF has a negative net charge (Ferbitz et al., 2004; Martinez-Hackert and Hendrickson, 2009), which may facilitate its interaction with positively charged nascent polypeptides, and a role of TF in the folding/assembly of ribosomal proteins has been suggested (Martinez-Hackert and Hendrickson, 2009). In contrast, the DnaK system is unable to replace the role of TF in the biogenesis of a set of secretory proteins, prominently including b-barrel proteins of the outer membrane (Figure 7B). These proteins undergo partial degradation in cells lacking TF, suggesting a speciﬁc role of TF in translocation of outer membrane preproteins across the inner membrane. Such a function of TF would be consistent with the initial identiﬁcation of TF as a chaperone of proOmpA translocation in vitro (Crooke et al., 1988) and with the ﬁnding that TF modulates the kinetics of

protein export (Lee and Bernstein, 2002; Ullers et al., 2007). It is also of interest in this context that TF structurally resembles the periplasmic chaperone for outer membrane proteins, SurA (Bitto and McKay, 2002; Ferbitz et al., 2004).
An effective functional cooperation apparently exists between TF and the DnaK system in the folding of a group of large multidomain proteins that aggregate substantially only in the absence of both chaperones. These proteins may normally interact sequentially with TF and DnaK during translation or with multiple TF molecules in the absence of DnaK, as shown with large model proteins in vitro (Agashe et al., 2004; Kaiser et al., 2006). Notably, most of these proteins would be unable to interact productively with GroEL, as the capacity of the GroEL/ES folding compartment is limited to proteins up to $60 kDa (Kerner et al., 2005).
The DnaK interactome overlaps extensively with the set of previously identiﬁed GroEL substrates (Figure 7B), most of which are below 50 kDa in size (Kerner et al., 2005). GroEL substrates amount to nearly 30% of the total mass of DnaK interactors, indicating that protein transfer between DnaK and GroEL is a central function of the chaperone network. We estimate that only a minor fraction of GroEL substrates ($20%) are transferred directly from TF to GroEL, circumventing DnaK (Figure 7B). Notably, upon GroEL-depletion, obligate GroEL substrates accumulate further on DnaK, reﬂecting an important role of DnaK as a buffer in stabilizing these proteins until GroEL is available or in transferring them to the proteolytic system.
Deﬁning Proteostasis Collapse Upon growth at 30C, the loss of individual chaperone modules—DnaK/DnaJ, TF or GroEL/ES—is remarkably well tolerated by E. coli cells in terms of preventing major protein aggregation. Instead, degradation is the strongly preferred fate of misfolded proteins under these conditions (Tables S2B, S6C, and S7C). However, proteostasis collapse characterized by extensive aggregation of relatively abundant proteins occurs when TF is deleted in addition to DnaK/DnaJ. Apparently, the chaperone capacity available for the folding and stabilization of large proteins in particular becomes severely limiting and, as a result, aggregation is favored relative to degradation. Furthermore, our data show that the loss of the upstream chaperones, TF and DnaK/DnaJ, disrupts the normal protein ﬂux to GroEL, resulting in wide-spread aggregation of GroEL-substrates, despite a $10-fold upregulation of GroEL under these conditions. The failure of newly synthesized GroEL substrates to reach the abundantly expressed chaperonin signiﬁes the systematic collapse of the chaperone network.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Bacterial Strains The E. coli strains used were based on MC4100 (WT) and are described in Extended Experimental Procedures.

ments, L-labeled cells were shifted to H-medium for 2 min and then chased by addition of a 100-fold excess of L arginine and lysine for 2, 4, and 8 min. Spheroplasts were prepared as described (Ewalt et al., 1997) and lysed in hypo-osmotic buffer containing apyrase. Soluble cell lysate was prepared by centrifugation (20,000 3 g, 30 min). Talon beads (Invitrogen) were used to isolate the DnaK-His6 and its interactors. The eluates containing bound proteins obtained from equal amounts of L-, M-, or H-labeled cells were mixed (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Samples were prepared for LC-MS/ MS as described (Figure 1C) (Ong and Mann, 2006). The spectra were interpreted using MaxQuant version 1.0.13.13 (Cox and Mann, 2008) combined with Mascot version 2.2 (Matrix Science, www.matrixscience.com).
The MaxQuant tables along with a full list of identiﬁed proteins and quantitations are available at the Proteome Commons Tranche repository (https://proteomecommons.org/) by inserting the following tranche code: RKuFJcuu8iBnZHlBN4Nth0pz+HQgPNvV0zJvdnMN8wyAN8l7ifufEnmW6j2C wn0msEakFC6eulEqlYv+7B+dFALonrgAAAAAAAAKDA== and passphrase: vqXGUF93rGLCraqm1yIl.
The raw data is accessible using tranche codes and passphrase given in Extended Experimental Procedures.
Fractionation of Total Cell Lysate E. coli MC4100 dnaK-His6 (KHis) and chaperone mutant strains were grown to OD600nm $1 at 30C or 37C, as indicated, in the respective SILAC medium. Cells were collected, ﬂash frozen, and lysed by sonication. Whole proteome analyses on total lysates, soluble, and detergent insoluble fractions (Deuerling et al., 2003) were performed by LC-MS/MS as described in Extended Experimental Procedures.
Bioinformatic Analysis Bioinformatics and statistical analyses of the physico-chemical properties of protein sequences were performed as detailed in Extended Experimental Procedures. Note that both DnaJ and GrpE, the cofactors of DnaK, are excluded in all bioinformatic analyses.

Isolation of DnaK-Interactor Complexes SILAC labeling of cells was performed at 37C in M63 medium supplemented with light (L), medium (M), or heavy (H) arginine and lysine isotopes (see Extended Experimental Procedures). DnaK interactors were isolated from cells growing exponentially (OD600nm $1). In pulse-SILAC experiments, L-labeled cells were shifted to M-medium for 2.5 min; in pulse chase-SILAC experi-
