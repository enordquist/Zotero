ABSTRACT: Available crystal structures of opioid receptors provide a high-resolution picture of ligand binding at the primary (“orthosteric”) site, that is, the site targeted by endogenous ligands. Recently, positive allosteric modulators of opioid receptors have also been discovered, but their modes of binding and action remain unknown. Here, we use a metadynamics-based strategy to eﬃciently sample the binding process of a recently discovered positive allosteric modulator of the δ-opioid receptor, BMS-986187, in the presence of the orthosteric agonist SNC-80, and with the receptor embedded in an explicit lipid−water environment. The dynamics of BMS986187 were enhanced by biasing the potential acting on the ligand−receptor distance and ligand−receptor interaction contacts. Representative lowest-energy structures from the reconstructed free-energy landscape revealed two alternative ligand binding poses at an allosteric site delineated by transmembrane (TM) helices TM1, TM2, and TM7, with some participation of TM6. Mutations of amino acid residues at these proposed allosteric sites were found to either aﬀect the binding of BMS-986187 or its ability to modulate the aﬃnity and/or eﬃcacy of SNC-80. Taken together, these combined experimental and computational studies provide the ﬁrst atomic-level insight into the modulation of opioid receptor binding and signaling by allosteric modulators.

O pioid receptors belong to the superfamily of G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest class of membrane proteins encoded by the human genome.1 Like
other GPCRs, they respond to extracellular stimuli such as
small molecules, peptides, and ions, by undergoing ligandspeciﬁc conformational changes and consequently recruiting and activating accessory proteins such as G proteins and βarrestins. Molecules targeting opioid receptors are eﬃcacious therapeutic agents, especially against pain2 or for controlling addiction,3 and a growing body of evidence suggests that opioid
receptor-targeted therapeutics may also have utility for the treatment of mood disorders.4 However, the beneﬁcial action of
current opioid drugs is severely limited by the development of adverse eﬀects, including respiratory depression, tolerance, dependence, constipation, and abuse liability.5
Most prescription opioid analgesics are small molecules (e.g.,
morphine, buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, etc.), and all bind to the primary “orthosteric” site on the receptor, which is
targeted by endogenous peptides. The recent crystal structures of all four opioid receptor types, namely the δ, μ, κ, and nociceptin receptors,6−10 provide high-resolution atomic in-
sight into drug binding at opioid receptor orthosteric sites. This

binding mostly involves amino acid residues in transmembrane (TM) helices TM3, TM6, and TM7, although interactions with TM2 have also been reported, depending on the speciﬁc ligand chemotype.11,12
In search of opioid therapeutics with reduced adverse eﬀects, recent high-throughput screening campaigns have identiﬁed positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of μ- and δ-opioid receptors,13,14 that is, ligands that potentiate the orthosteric agonist-induced response of these receptors. This represents a signiﬁcant discovery in view of the potential advantages of allosteric modulators compared to classical orthosteric ligands.15 For instance, by targeting nonconserved, allosteric regions of the receptor, allosteric ligands may aﬀord signiﬁcant receptor subtype selectivity, resulting in limited oﬀ-target eﬀects. This advantage of PAMs may be less important in the case of opioid receptors, where several selective opioid ligands are already available, and undesired responses often result from

on-target eﬀects of drugs binding the receptor in diﬀerent tissues or brain regions. A potentially more important feature of opioid PAMs is that they would only act in the presence of the endogenous ligand, thus maintaining the temporal and spatial ﬁdelity of opioid signaling in vivo. A direct consequence of this trait is potentially reduced receptor desensitization, resulting in the attenuation of the dependence and tolerance that are produced by classical orthosteric agonists. Additionally, opioid PAMs may be able to avoid opioid receptor-mediated adverse eﬀects such as constipation and respiratory depression, again by virtue of acting only at cells/tissues where native opioid signaling is naturally occurring. Moreover, as the eﬀect of allosteric modulators is limited by the degree of cooperativity with the orthosteric agonist, opioid PAMs are expected to exert fewer on-target overdosing risks, which represent a serious
practical issue for current prescription painkillers. The reader is referred to a recent review16 for additional information about potential advantages of opioid PAMs.
Using inferences from binding kinetic experiments, cannabidiol was previously proposed as a negative allosteric modulator of δ and μ receptors,17 although it remains unclear whether this eﬀect is mediated directly via the opioid receptors, or potentially via cooperative interactions between homo- or hetero-oligomeric receptors. In contrast, more recent studies have identiﬁed novel small molecules, e.g., BMS-986121 and BMS-986122, as ﬁrst-in-class PAMs acting directly on the μopioid receptor.18 Similarly, compounds BMS-986187 and BMS-986188 were recently shown to behave as potent PAMs at the δ-opioid receptor, modulating the aﬃnity and/or eﬃcacy of both peptidic (leu-enkephalin) and small-molecule agonists (SNC-80 and TAN-67) at several biological end points (receptor binding, G protein activation, β-arrestin recruitment, adenylyl cyclase inhibition, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation).13 Although these molecules are assumed to bind to sites that are topographically distinct from the orthosteric binding site, their actual binding pockets and modes are unknown. Through a combination of enhanced molecular dynamics simulations of binding of BMS-986187 to the δ-opioid receptor in the presence of an orthosteric ligand and experimental validation, the work reported here provides the ﬁrst structural insights into the allosteric modulation of opioid receptors by small molecules.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Predictions from multiple-walker well-tempered all-atom metadynamics simulations were used in combination with experimental structure−function analysis of binding and functional assays on both wild type (WT) and selected mutants of the δ-opioid receptor to identify the preferred modes of binding of the recently identiﬁed PAM BMS-98618713 to the δopioid receptor in complex with the selective orthosteric agonist SNC-80 and embedded in an explicit lipid−water environment.
Free-energy Landscape for the Binding Process of BMS-986187 to the δ-Opioid Receptor. Automated docking algorithms using scoring functions of varying complex-
ity and accuracy have successfully been applied to opioid receptor crystal structures over the past few years, allowing the identiﬁcation of novel compounds that bind at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors (e.g., see refs 19, 20). Our initial attempts of using automated docking algorithms to predict the binding mode of BMS-986187 at the δ-opioid receptor were hindered by the identiﬁcation of multiple positions and

orientations of the ligand in a relatively large binding pocket
within the extracellular half of the receptor. The lack of crystal
structures of opioid receptors bound to allosteric modulators and rough estimates of binding aﬃnity from oversimpliﬁed
scoring functions did not allow us to unambiguously favor a particular binding mode of the δ-PAM over another, thus
motivating us to explore the predictive power of more
sophisticated methods.
Recently, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
have successfully been applied to predict the spontaneous
binding of allosteric modulators to GPCRs (e.g., see ref 21).
However, since ligand binding at a target site is a relatively rare
event on microscopic time-scales, these simulations have
required several million computing hours on special-purpose
computational resources and remain of limited accessibility. We recently proposed the use of metadynamics22 as a more eﬃcient enhanced sampling method to study the long time scale process of ligand binding to GPCRs.23 We ﬁrst applied this method to successfully predict ligand binding to the δ-
opioid receptor at a time when the crystal structure was not available yet24 and have further validated it using crystal structures of various receptor types. Brieﬂy, the method
accelerates the conformational sampling of a system by adding
to the potential energy a history-dependent term acting on a
small number of collective variables (CVs) representing the
slow degrees of freedom relevant to the process under study.
In the study reported here, we simulated the binding of the allosteric modulator, BMS-986187, to the δ-opioid receptor embedded in an explicit lipid−water environment and with
SNC-80 bound to the orthosteric site. We carried out a total of 3.6 μs multiple-walker well-tempered metadynamics simula-
tions, biasing the potential along the following two CVs: the BMS-986187−receptor distance and the number of BMS986187−receptor interactions, herein labeled CV1 and CV2, respectively. To better characterize the diﬀerent binding modes
adopted by BMS-986187, the reweighting strategy described in
ref 25 was used to calculate the free-energy as a function of the
biased CVs (CV1 and CV2) and two additional degrees of
freedom, namely the Z-component of the vector linking the ligand’s tricyclic structure with its ortho-substituted benzyl ring
(CV3) and the XY projection of the BMS-986187-receptor
distance (CV4; see the Methods section for more details).
A projection of the reconstructed four-dimensional free-
energy landscape onto CV1 and CV2 is shown in Figure 1. This free-energy reveals a broad basin centered at a ∼2 nm distance
between BMS-986187 and the receptor center (CV1), and encompassing binding states characterized by a diﬀerent
number of BMS-986187-receptor contacts (CV2), ranging
approximately from 4 to 6. Free-energy convergence as a function of the diﬀerent CVs was evaluated by plotting diﬀerences of its two-dimensional projections between the full simulation and its ﬁrst three-quarters. The convergence of
the reconstructed free-energy projected onto CV1 and CV2 is
shown in Supporting Information Figure S1 as an example. Low free-energy states (within 2 × kBT of the minimum) in
the four-dimensional phase-space deﬁned by CV1−CV4
correspond to highly populated BMS-986187 binding poses. To characterize these poses, we calculated interaction ﬁnger-
prints involving either the orthosteric or allosteric ligand and the δ-opioid receptor. We then clustered these poses based on ﬁngerprint similarity and estimated the relative free-energy of the diﬀerent states (see Methods section for details). This
analysis revealed seven compact clusters characterized by

Predicted Lowest Free-Energy Binding Modes of BMS-986187 at the δ-Opioid Receptor. The results of the enhanced simulations reported herein suggest that the allosteric modulator BMS-986187 adopts multiple metastable binding states during the binding process. The two most stable binding states of BMS-986187 (red and blue sticks in Figure 2) occupy the same binding pocket within the δ-opioid receptor and have virtually indistinguishable free energy (i.e., there is just

a 0.03 kcal/mol diﬀerence between them, which is smaller than the estimation error). Notably, there is no appreciable similarity between these predicted poses from simulations and the topranked docking conformations obtained using Glide XP version 6.9. As shown in Figure 2, representative structures of these two most stable BMS-986187 states share common interactions of the 2-methyl-benzyl group with the receptor but show diﬀerent orientations of the fused tricyclic moiety within a binding pocket of the δ-opioid receptor surrounded by TM1, TM2, and TM7 helices, with some involvement of TM6. Figure 3 and Table S1 show the details and probabilities of the BMS-986187receptor and the SNC-80-receptor interactions for these representative, stable binding poses. In both states 1 and 2 (red and blue sticks, respectively, in Figure 2), which are representative conformations of clusters 1 and 2 of the ligand− receptor interaction ﬁngerprints, the allosteric ligand (see Figure 3a) forms direct polar, water-mediated polar, hydrophobic, and/or aromatic interactions with human δ-opioid receptor residues I52(1.35), Y56(1.39), L102(2.57), Y109(2.64), E112(2.67), V297(7.32), H301(7.36), I304(7.39), and Y308(7.43) (numbers in parentheses refer to two-digit numbers as per the Ballesteros−Weinstein generic numbering scheme26). The diﬀerences between these two poses (illustrated in separate panels in Figure S3) are mainly hydrophobic interactions between BMS-986187 and residues L46(1.29), L48(1.31), and L110(2.65) in conformations of cluster 1 but not cluster 2, and hydrophobic interactions between BMS-986187 and residues W284(6.58) and L300(7.35), and water-mediated interactions between BMS986187 and residues Q105(2.60) and K108(2.63) in conformations of cluster 2, but not cluster 1. Note that the orientation of the Y109(2.64) side chain in state 1 is similar to that of the naltrindole-bound δ-opioid receptor crystal structure, but the Y109(2.64) side chain (shown in Figure 2a as red and blue transparent sticks for states 1 and 2,

respectively) must rotate up and away from the center of the helical bundle for BMS-986187 to adopt the conformation of state 2.
Notably, during the whole simulation of BMS-986187 binding to the δ-opioid receptor, the orthosteric ligand SNC80 maintains a stable orientation between helices TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7 in the orthosteric binding pocket. A comparison of the interactions that the orthosteric ligand SNC-80 forms in either state 1 or state 2, is provided through the wheel plots of Figure 3b while a full list of the interactions that have a 20% probability for each pose is reported in Table S1. Speciﬁcally, the receptor residues involved in interaction with SNC-80 in both states are D128(3.32), Y129(3.33), M132(3.36), K214(5.39), V217(5.42), W274(6.48), I277(6.51), H278(6.52), F280(6.54), V281(6.55), W284(6.58), and L300(7.35), while the hydrophobic interactions between SNC-80 and I304(7.39) and Y308(7.43) are present in state 2 only.
Less stable binding modes of BMS-986187, with relative free energies higher than kBT, and thus signiﬁcantly less populated at room temperature, included four additional binding states. These states, labeled states 3, 4, 5, and 7 in Figure S4, have free energies of 0.97, 0.98, 1.20, and 4.12 kcal/mol, respectively, relative to state 1. An additional state is observed in which the allosteric ligand is trapped in a location between the membrane and the receptor (state 6 in violet in Figure S4 has a relative free-energy of 3.62 kcal/mol relative to state 1). A comprehensive list of all the interactions established by both the allosteric and orthosteric ligands in each of these states is provided in Table S1.
Experimental Testing of the Predicted Binding Modes of BMS-986187 at the δ-Opioid Receptor. The contribution of several δ-opioid receptor residues to the aﬃnity of the allosteric ligand BMS-986187 and its ability to modulate the binding and/or the eﬃcacy of the orthosteric agonist SNC-80 were probed experimentally via functional assays conducted at the WT and selected mutants of the human δ-opioid receptor. Speciﬁcally, the following mutants were generated and tested in an attempt to identify the molecular determinants responsible for BMS-986187 binding and/or modulatory action, as well as ways to discriminate between the two identiﬁed lowest-energy states of BMS-986187: Y56(1.39)A, Q105(2.60)A, K108(2.63)A, K108(2.63)N (as in μ-opioid receptor; a valine

or an aspartic acid in κ-opioid receptor and nociceptin receptor,
respectively), Y109(2.64)A, Y109(2.64)I (as in the nociceptin receptor), W284(6.58)K (as in μ-opioid receptor; a glutamic acid or a glutamine in κ-opioid receptor and nociceptin receptor, respectively), L300(7.35)W (as in μ-opioid receptor; a tyrosine in κ-opioid receptor), H301(7.36)R (as in nociceptin receptor), and H301(7.36)Y (as in κ-opioid receptor). Among
them, W284(6.58)K and L300(7.35)W mutations had previously been shown to aﬀect signiﬁcantly the binding of SNC-80 to the δ-opioid receptor.27,28
First, cell surface expression levels of all δ-opioid receptor
mutants were determined by anti-HA ELISA (see Figure S5); any signiﬁcant variations relative to the expression of the WT were factored into the ﬁnal parameter estimates of the signaling eﬃcacy for both the orthosteric and allosteric ligands (see
below).
Using ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/2) assays as a measure of δ-opioid receptor activity, concentration−response
curves to the orthosteric agonist SNC-80 were constructed in
the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of the
PAM BMS-986187, at the WT and the aforementioned mutant δ-opioid receptors (Figure S6). The potency (EC50) and maximum response to SNC-80 (Emax) at the WT and mutant
receptors are reported in Table S2. Analysis of the interaction
between SNC-80 and BMS-986187 was performed using an operational model of allosterism and agonism.29 Brieﬂy, this
model is obtained by combining a simple allosteric ternary
complex model with the operational model of agonism. As
such, it allows the description of the ability of both the
orthosteric and the allosteric ligands to exhibit agonism (incorporating the intrinsic eﬃcacy of each ligand, the total density of receptors, and the eﬃciency of the coupling of the
ligand stimulus to the assay response), as well as capturing allosteric eﬀects of BMS-986187 on both binding aﬃnity and eﬃcacy of SNC-80 (see Methods section for details).
This analysis yielded estimates of three key parameters: (i) the functional aﬃnity of the allosteric modulator BMS-986187 for the unoccupied δ-opioid receptor (pKB, Table 1), (ii) an overall cooperativity value, αβ, which incorporates modulatory eﬀects on both orthosteric agonist aﬃnity (α) and eﬃcacy (β)
(Table 1), and (iii) the ability of each ligand to directly activate the receptor in its own right (τA for SNC-80 and τB for BMS986187; Table S2 and Table S3). In addition, we performed
whole cell radioligand competition binding experiments to allow us to discriminate, where possible, the modulatory eﬀect
of BMS-986187 solely on binding cooperativity at the WT and mutant receptors (i.e α). These experiments were performed using [3H]diprenorphine and increasing concentrations of
SNC-80 in the absence or presence of increasing concen-
trations of the PAM BMS-986187 (Figure S7). The control SNC-80 competition curves were ﬁtted to a one-site competitive binding model to derive aﬃnity estimates (pKi) for the orthosteric agonist (Table S2), whereas the entire data set in the presence of an allosteric modulator was ﬁtted to an allosteric ternary complex model29 to derive estimates of the cooperativity between the PAM and the radioligand (α′; see
Table S3) as well as the cooperativity between the PAM and SNC-80 (α). The radioligand interaction studies revealed that BMS-986187 displays negative cooperativity with [3H]diprenorphine (0 < α′ < 1, Table S3) and neutral binding cooperativity (α ∼ 1; see Table 1) with SNC-80 at the WT
receptor. This result extends from our initial functional
characterization of BMS-986187 and reveals that this allosteric

modulator is mainly an eﬃcacy modulator of orthosteric
agonists. A similar behavior of the PAM was observed at the
Q105(2.60)A, Y109(2.64)A, and K108(2.63)A/N mutants,
while it showed positive binding cooperativity with SNC-80 at
Y109(2.64)I and H301(7.36)R/Y (Table 1, Figure S7). For the
Y56(1.39)A, W284(6.58)K, and L300(7.35)W mutants, no modulation of SNC-80 or [3H]diprenorphine was observed,
with the competition binding curves in the presence of PAM
overlaying with the curve observed in the absence of PAM
(Figure S7). Therefore, by combining our data from both
functional and radioligand binding experiments, we were able
to validate the predicted allosteric binding pocket at opioid receptors by relating mutations to changes in the aﬃnity of BMS-986187 and its allosteric eﬀects upon both orthosteric ligand aﬃnity and eﬃcacy. Figure 4 represents a graphical
illustration of the mutation-induced changes of the estimated
allosteric parameters of BMS-986187. At the WT receptor, BMS-986187 exhibited an aﬃnity of
∼0.6 μM and positive allosteric modulation with a functional cooperativity factor of β ∼ 12 (Table 1). Five of the 10 tested mutants, speciﬁcally Q105(2.60)A, Y109(2.64)I, W284(6.58)K, L300(7.35)W, and H301(7.36)Y, display a signiﬁcant reduction of the estimated BMS-986187 binding aﬃnity (KB) with respect to the WT receptor (see Table 1, Figure 4), suggesting the involvement of the corresponding wild-type δ-opioid
receptor residues in a direct or water-mediated interaction with the allosteric ligand. Two of these ﬁve residues
(W284(6.58) and L300(7.35)) are involved in interactions
with SNC-80 in the two states (see Table S1), and the pronounced eﬀect of their mutations on aﬃnity and eﬃcacy of
SNC-80 (see Table S2) is in line with the hypothesis of a direct eﬀect on the binding of the orthosteric ligand as well as previously published experimental data.27,28
Mutation of the Y109(2.64) residue to isoleucine did not only aﬀect BMS-986187 binding aﬃnity but it also resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in both its binding and functional cooperativity (α and β values in Table 1, respectively).
Interestingly, the L300(7.35)W mutation also displayed a signiﬁcant increase in the functional cooperativity of BMS986187 (βL300W ∼ 140 vs βWT ∼ 12), despite negligible eﬀects in the binding interaction experiments (αL300W ∼ 1). Finally, two mutations that had no eﬀect on BMS-986187 binding were found to aﬀect the binding cooperativity (H301(7.36)R) or
functional cooperativity (K108(2.63)N) between the modu-
lator and the orthosteric agonist.
Collectively, our data support BMS-986187 state 2 (blue
sticks in Figure 2) as the most substantiated state, as it is the only one where all the δ opioid-receptor residues that are inferred to contribute to BMS-986187 binding aﬃnity (e.g.,
Q105(2.60), Y109(2.64), W284(6.58), L300(7.35), and
H301(7.36)) have a high probability to be involved in
interaction with the allosteric ligand (see Table S1). In
particular, residues Q105(2.60), W284(6.58), and L300(7.35)
are found to form interactions with BMS-986187 in state 2 only. In spite of these diﬀerences, our computational predictions and experimental validation are currently insuﬃcient to discriminate unambiguously between the ligand’s states
1 and 2, and the current assumption is that they would be
equally populated at room temperature. Nonetheless, both identiﬁed states and experimental data support the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of an opioid receptor allosteric pocket in

Bars represent the diﬀerence in pKB (top panel), binding cooperativity (log α, middle panel), and eﬃcacy cooperativity (log β, bottom panel) of BMS-986167 relative to WT as derived from functional and binding interaction experiments with SNC-80 (Table 1). Data represent the mean ± SE of three experiments performed in duplicate. Statistical signiﬁcance levels from Dunnet’s test p values are indicated as stars (respectively p < 0.05, 0.01, 0.001).
TM2, and TM7, does not coincide with that seen in the crystal structure of the peptide-bound δ-opioid receptor,30 where the DIPP-NH2 tetra-peptide extends toward the receptor’s TM3 and extracellular loop (EL) 2. Although this peptide binding region does not overlap with states 1 or 2, it does so with the less stable state 3 identiﬁed in our simulations (see Figure S8).

■ CONCLUSION

Articles

We have presented here results from computational predictions and experimental validation that provide the ﬁrst atomic-level

insight into the modulation of opioid receptor binding and/or signaling by allosteric modulators. Speciﬁc binding sites and conformational states were identiﬁed for BMS-986187, a recently discovered positive allosteric modulator of the δ-

opioid receptor, based on inferences from free-energy calculations. This information led to the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc molecular determinants that are responsible for binding

of the allosteric modulator to the receptor and/or its ability to modulate the binding aﬃnity and/or eﬃcacy of the orthosteric agonist SCN-80. Speciﬁcally, mutations of residues

Q105(2.60), K108(2.63), Y109(2.64), W284(6.58), L300(7.35), and H301(7.36) are shown to have an eﬀect on either the allosteric modulator binding aﬃnity, or cooperativity,

or both. While Q105(2.60)A, W284(6.58)K, and H301(7.36)Y are shown to only aﬀect the binding aﬃnity of the allosteric ligand, Y109(2.64)I and L300(7.35)W appear to aﬀect both the allosteric binding aﬃnity and its cooperativity. In contrast,

mutants such as H301(7.36)R and K108(2.63)N are found to only aﬀect allosteric cooperativity. The results presented here represent the initial step in the identiﬁcation of the binding

sites of allosteric modulators at the opioid receptor family. Future work will assess whether increased PAM aﬃnity or

cooperativity can be achieved through alternative mutations

within these sites. For instance, the replacement of Y109(2.64) with a positively charged amino acid may increase PAM aﬃnity

and/or cooperativity based on the results of our simulations.

Together, these data will inform future rational design and drug discovery eﬀorts toward novel allosteric modulators of the δ-

opioid receptor.
■ METHODS

System Setup and Equilibration. The ultrahigh resolution crystal structure of the δ-opioid receptor (PDB ID: 4N6H6) without the ﬂexible N-terminal amino acid residues (G36SPGA40) was used as a starting conformation. With the exception of crystallographic water
molecules, all other non-protein atoms, as well as the cytochrome b562 RIL insert, were removed. The δ-selective agonist SNC-80 (4-[(R)-
[(2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethylpiperazin-1-yl](3-methoxyphenyl)-
methyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide) was docked into the ligand-free receptor using the Schrödinger Suite 2014-1 and the strategy we previously reported in the literature.31 Brieﬂy, the ligand was prepared using LigPrep version 2.932 at physiological pH while the Protein
Preparation Wizard tool was used to add hydrogen atoms and assign bond orders. Flexible ligand docking of SNC-80 to the δ-receptor was performed using extra-precision Glide XP version 6.2.33
The complex formed by SNC-80 and the δ-opioid receptor was
embedded in a pre-equilibrated patch of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 10% cholesterol, further
solvated with water and NaCl at 150 mM. Additional chloride ions
were added to neutralize the system. The entire simulation box measured 83 × 83 × 110 Å3 and consisted of the δ-receptor, ∼20 cholesterol molecules, ∼200 POPC molecules, ∼15 000 water molecules, ∼35 sodium ions, and ∼50 chloride ions, totaling ∼77 600 atoms. This system was simulated using the TIP3P water model and the Charmm36 force ﬁeld for the protein, lipids, and ions.
Ligand parameters were obtained from the CHARMM General Force Field, validated according to the published guidelines,34 and are
available upon request.
All MD simulations reported herein (restrained, unrestrained, and
metadynamics simulations) were performed using the Gromacs 4.6 simulation package35 in the NPT ensemble at 300 K and 1 bar, with a Nose−Hoover thermostat,36 Parrinello−Rahman pressure coupling,37
and a 2 fs time step. All bonds were constrained using the LINCS

algorithm,38 and short-range, nonbonded interactions were cut oﬀ at a
10 Å distance. The SNC-80-bound δ-receptor in the membrane mimetic environ-
ment was equilibrated for 6 ns with decreasing positional restraints ﬁrst set on all heavy atoms and then on Cα atoms only, followed by a
50 ns unrestrained equilibration run. The pose of SNC-80 remained
stable during the equilibration run as judged by a heavy atom root-
mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.9 Å between the initial docking
pose and the equilibrated one. An initial pose of BMS-986187 (3,3,6,6-
tetramethyl-9-(4-((2-methylbenzyl)oxy)phenyl)-3,4,5,6,7,9-hexahydro-1H-xanthene-1,8(2H)-dione) inside the δ-receptor was obtained by docking the ligand into the equilibrated SNC-80-bound δ-receptor
using the same procedure used to dock SNC-80. This system was equilibrated for 6 ns with decreasing positional restraints set ﬁrst on all heavy atoms and then on Cα atoms only. To obtain additional, diﬀerent starting structures of BMS-986187 for the multiple-walker
metadynamics procedure, both inside the receptor and in the bulk
solvent, a 40 ns metadynamics run was carried out using PLUMED version 1.339 and the GROMACS version 4.6 package as well as one
CV describing the distance between the centers of mass of the BMS986187 heavy atoms and the transmembrane helical bundle of the δ-
receptor. A deposition rate of 10 ps, a bias factor of 10, a Gaussian hill
height of 0.8 kJ/mol, and a Gaussian width of 0.125 Å were used in
these metadynamics simulations. Lower and upper limits of 8 and 37
Å, respectively, on the aforementioned CV were imposed using steep, harmonic restraints with an elastic constant of 4000 kJ/nm2. It must be noted that starting positions of the diﬀerent walkers could have been
provided by other methods (e.g., automated docking algorithms). The
use of a short metadynamics run to generate initial conformations, has,
however, some technical advantages. First and foremost, it provides a validation of the ability of the chosen CVs to eﬀectively enhance the sampling of diﬀerent ligand conformations. Moreover, it generates
solvated and equilibrated starting systems, whereas independently
docked ligands would have to undergo additional preparation steps
before any MD-based simulation could be performed. Multiple Walker Metadynamics. Metadynamics22 enhances the
sampling of selected CVs by applying to the system’s dynamics a
history-dependent, periodically updated bias that discourages the
system from revisiting conformations that have already been sampled. In its well-tempered version,40 the bias contributions are scaled so that
the CV can overcome free-energy barriers of controlled height,
allowing assessment of the convergence more directly. To improve the sampling eﬃciency, multiple independent trajectories (i.e., “walkers”) that contribute to the same bias can be simulated in parallel.41 The
multiple-walker well-tempered metadynamics protocol employed in
this study involved 15 walkers and resulted in a total simulation time of ∼3.6 μs. Initial height of the Gaussian bias contributions of 0.8 kJ/
mol, a deposition rate of 5 ps, and a bias factor of 15 were used for
these simulations. The sampling was biased along two CVs: CV1
represented the distance between the centers of mass of the BMS986187 heavy atoms and the TM helical bundle of the δ-receptor, and
CV2 corresponded to the total number of polar and hydrophobic contacts formed at any time between BMS-986187 and the δ receptor. More speciﬁcally, this was deﬁned as

∑ ∑ CV2

Rec,polar

∑ ∑ +

where rij is the distance between the center-of-mass (COM) of groups i and j, and r0 was set to 5.0 Å. The receptor polar group comprises all the side-chain heavy atoms of charged and polar residues in the
binding funnel; the receptor hydrophobic group comprises all the side-
chain heavy atoms of hydrophobic residues in the binding funnel; ligand polar groups comprise each of the ligand’s four oxygen atoms
(see Figure S9); the ligand hydrophobic groups comprise heavy atoms in the methyl substituents on the fused tricyclic ring (deﬁned as the

COM of atoms C20−C21 for one group, and COM of C22−C23 for
the other, see Figure S9), as well each of the of two six-membered rings (deﬁned as the COM of atoms C2 and C5 for one ring, and
COM of C29 and C31 for the other, see Figure S9). Gaussian widths
of 0.125 Å and 0.15 were selected for CV1 and CV2, respectively,
based on inspection of the initial dynamics of the system. Lower and
upper limits of 8 and 47 Å, respectively, for the values of CV1 were
enforced using steep harmonic potentials with an elastic constant of 4000 kJ/nm2. To avoid the ligand sampling of the membrane region, additional harmonic restraint (elastic constant of 4000 kJ/nm2) was
enforced on the XY component of CV1, with an upper limit of 32 Å. Clustering Based on Interaction Fingerprints. Because of the
applied bias, the simulation does not sample the Boltzmann ensemble
and the trajectory must therefore be reweighted before further analysis.
To this end, the unbiasing technique described in ref 25 was used to calculate the free-energy of microstates deﬁned by the values of four
CVs optimally describing the binding pose of the ligand in the allosteric pocket. Speciﬁcally, in addition to the two CVs described above (CV1 and CV2), CV3 was deﬁned as the Z component of the
vector linking the center of mass of the BMS-986187 tricyclic moiety (carbons C7−C19 in Figure S9) with the center of mass of the orthosubstituted benzyl ring (carbons C25−30 in Figure S9), and CV4 was deﬁned as the XY component of CV1. The two additional CVs were
introduced to discriminate poses with similar values of CV1 and CV2, but diﬀerent orientations and positions in the helix bundle.
Microstates were deﬁned by dividing the range of each CV into 75 bins. Microstates with free-energy below 5 kJ/mol (∼2 kBT) were considered for further analysis, and the binding pose in each microstate s was described by the probability δi(s) of any speciﬁc contact i being formed in the microstate itself. Any interaction
between the ligands and the receptor, or between SNC-80 and BMS986187 ligands, was considered and classiﬁed either as direct contact (further speciﬁed as hydrophobic interaction; H-bond with the ligand as a donor, H-bond with the ligand as acceptor; aromatic π-cation,
edge-to-face or face-to-face), or a water-mediated interaction (i.e., one
water molecule simultaneously forming H-bonds with one ligand and
the protein, or with both ligands, simultaneously). Direct interactions with the receptor were further classiﬁed based on whether the backbone or the side chain of a speciﬁc residue was involved in the
interaction. Microstates were clustered into macrostates using the dissimilarity between ﬁngerprints deﬁned as

d(s, s′) = || δi(s) − δi(s′)||

(2)

and a Ward agglomerative algorithm. The total number of clusters, which needs to be speciﬁed by the user, was determined so that the average Tanimoto coeﬃcient (that ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the
highest similarity) between clusters is less than 0.5. The free-energy of each cluster α was calculated as

∫ Fα(t) = −kBT log ds exp(−F(s, t)/kBT) + kBT log Z α

(3)

where the integration is extended to all the microstates s comprising cluster α, kBT is the thermal energy, Z is the partition function, and t is the simulation time.
Convergence of the free-energy estimates was assessed by plotting the diﬀerence of the free-energy between 75% and 100% of the simulation and checking that the diﬀerence was less than 1 kJ/mol in
absolute value in the region of the minima.
After extracting medoid structures for each cluster, the probability of any speciﬁc contact being formed in each macrostate was obtained
as a weighted average of the microstate probabilities, that is

Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. All mutations were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing (AGRF, Melbourne, Australia).
Mutant 3xHA-hDOR pEF5/FRT/V5-DEST constructs were trans-
fected into FlpIn CHO cells (Life Technologies, Melbourne, Australia)
and selected using hygromycin B (Roche, Sydney, Australia) for stable expression. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) with 5% v/v FBS and 700 μg/ mL hygromycin B in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
Whole Cell Radioligand Binding. Cells were seeded at 50 000
per well in a 96-well Isoplate (PerkinElmer, Melbourne, Australia),
allowed to adhere for 6 h, and then serum starved overnight. Plates were washed once with ice-cold assay buﬀer (146 mM NaCl, 10 mM
D-glucose, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 1.5 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were incubated with increasing
concentrations of SNC-80 (in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of allosteric modulator) for 4 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.3 nM [3H]-diprenorphine (PerkinElmer, speciﬁc activity 36.1 Ci/ mmol). Nonspeciﬁc binding was determined by the coaddition of 100 μM naloxone. After washing in cold saline, cells were solubilized in
Optiphase scintillant, and radioactivity was measured in a MicroBeta
counter (PerkinElmer). ELISA. Cells were seeded at 125 000 per well in a 48-well cell
culture plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Plates were washed with Tris-buﬀered saline (TBS; 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), ﬁxed with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde for 30 min at RT, and incubated with blocking buﬀer (1% w/v skim milk powder in 100 mM NaHCO3, pH 8.6) for 4 h at RT. Surface Human inﬂuenza hemagglutinin (HA)-
tagged receptors were detected using the HA-7 mouse anti-HA
antibody (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney, Australia), followed by
HRP-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (1:2000, Sigma-Aldrich). After
washing with TBS, the peroxidase substrate SIGMAFAST OPD was
added, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 M HCl.
The colored reaction product was detected at 490 nm in a multilabel
plate reader (EnVision, PerkinElmer). The absorbance values for
stably expressing cells were normalized to those of untransfected cells. ERK1/2 Phosphorylation. Cells were seeded into transparent 96-
well plates at 50 000 per well, allowed to adhere for 6 h, and then
serum starved overnight. Previous studies have shown that maximal stimulation of DOR by SNC-80 is achieved after 5 min.13 Thus, cells were stimulated with ligands for 5 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For interaction studies with BMS-986187, increasing concentrations of
SNC-80 and allosteric ligand were added simultaneously. The reaction
was terminated by removal of media and ligands, and the samples were
processed using the AlphaScreen SureFire p-ERK1/2 kit (PerkinElmer) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The ﬂuorescence signal was measured using a Fusion-α plate reader (PerkinElmer). Data were
normalized to the maximal response elicited by 10% v/v FBS at the
same time point. Data Analysis. All data were analyzed using Prism 6.0f (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA). Competition binding curves between [3H]diprenorphine and an unlabeled ligand were ﬁtted to a one-site binding model.42 Binding interaction studies with allosteric ligands were ﬁtted to the following allosteric ternary complex model, eq 5:43

SNC-80 concentration response curves were analyzed using a threeparameter logistic equation as previously described.44

All aﬃnity, potency, and cooperativity values were estimated as logarithms,45 and statistical comparisons between values were by oneway analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison post hoc test to determine signiﬁcant diﬀerences between mutant receptors and the WT 3xHA-hDOR. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
