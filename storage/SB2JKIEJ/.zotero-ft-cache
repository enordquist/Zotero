The structural basis underlying the gating of large conductance Ca2؉-activated K؉ (BK) channels remains elusive. We found that substitution of Leu-312 in the S6 transmembrane segment of mSlo1 BK channels with hydrophilic amino acids of smaller side-chain volume favored the open state. The sensitivities of channels to calcium and voltage were modified by some mutations and completely abolished by others. Interpretation of the results in terms of an allosteric model suggests that the calcium-insensitive mutants greatly destabilize the closed relative to the open conformation and may also disrupt the allosteric coupling between Ca2؉ or voltage sensors and the gate. Some Phe-315 mutations also favor the open state, suggesting that Leu-312 and Phe-315 may interact in the closed state, forming a major energy barrier that the channel has to overcome to open. Homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulations further support that the side chain of Leu-312 can couple strongly with the aromatic ring of Phe-315 in neighboring subunits (L-F coupling) to maintain the channel closed. Additionally, singlechannel recordings indicate that the calcium-insensitive mutants, whose kinetics can be approximately characterized by a two-state closed-open (C-O) model, exhibit nearly 100% open probability under physiological conditions without alterations in single-channel conductance. These findings provide a basis for understanding the structure and gating of the BK channel pore.
High conductance, “big” Kϩ (BK)4 channels encoded by the Slo1 gene are widely expressed in many tissues and respond to both membrane depolarization and submembrane Ca2ϩ concentration ([Ca2ϩ]i) (1– 4). Because BK channels have apparently evolved from voltage-dependent Kϩ (KV) channels, they share many features in common with KV channels such as a similar Kϩ selectivity filter and conserved ion conduction pore

(5). On the other hand, detailed studies indicate that there are significant differences in the permeation and gating properties of KV and BK channels. First, BK channels have the largest single-channel conductance among Kϩ channels under similar recording conditions (6), partly because of two negatively charged rings at the entrance to the intracellular vestibule of BK channels that are absent from many KV channels (7). Second, the mouth of the BK pore on the cytoplasmic side appears to be larger than other Kϩ channels because the on-rates for channel block by quaternary ammonium (QA) ions are limited only by diffusion (8), whereas the on-rates for QA block of other Kϩ channels are substantially slower. Additionally, it has been proposed that the pore-lining S6 segment of BK channels may not act as a permeation gate (8) as in Shaker KV channels (9). Therefore, the BK channel may have an unusual pore, and understanding the structural basis of the above differences could provide important insight into the permeation and gating properties of Kϩ channels.
Despite the differences between BK and KV channels, it is likely that the opening and closing of their pores involve similar conformational changes. Flexing of the inner S6 helix at or near a conserved glycine residue is thought to open the pore, whereas straightening closes it (10, 11). The inner helix of BK channels is potentially more flexible than that of KV channels because it contains a twin glycine motif (Gly-310 –Gly-311). Differences in permeation property, pore geometry, and gating could potentially be accounted for by differences in S6 flexibility as well as the specific side-chain properties and interactions that occur between pore-lining residues. In this study we focused on Leu-312 and Phe-315 because we inferred from sequence analogy with KcsA channels (12) and our previous studies of BK channels (13, 14) that they are two of the five pore-lining residues (the others being Leu-309, Val-319, and Ile-323), and they are near the putative gating hinge. Our results indicate that substitutions of Leu-312 or Phe-315 have profound effects on BK channel gating, consistent with the notion that these residues interact between different subunits to hold the channel closed. The interaction of these residues may also be important for coordinating conformational changes in different subunits to ensure the efficient and cooperative longrange coupling between channel subunits, which is probably a general property of allosterically regulated proteins. Moreover, a surprising loss of Ca2ϩ- and voltage sensitivity that accompanies mutations of Leu-312 or Phe-315 raises the possibility that these residues play a broader role in allosteric communication between sensors and gates.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Site-directed Mutagenesis—Full-length cDNA for mSlo1 (accession number NP_034740) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1Zeo (ϩ) (Invitrogen). Mutations were obtained by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To get the cRNA of mSlo1 and the mutants, cDNA of mSlo1 and mutants were subcloned into pXMX (a vector kindly provided by C. J. Lingle). All of the constructs were checked by sequencing. To prepare M7 GppGp-capped cRNA, the plasmids were linearized with Enzyme MluI and then in vitro transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science).
Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and grown in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. A day before transfection cells were transferred to 24-well plates. When 90% confluent, cells were transiently transected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Electrophysiological experiments were performed 1–2 days after transfection.
Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—After DNA was linearized with MluI, SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) was used to synthesize cRNA for oocyte injection. 3–24 h after harvest, stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were injected with 18 –36 nl of RNA (10 –20 ng/ml) using the Drummond Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA). After injection, oocytes were maintained in ND-96 solution at 18 °C. Currents were recorded 2–7 days after cRNA injection. ND-96 solution (pH 7.5) containing 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM Hϩ-HEPES was supplemented with 2.5 sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin (incubation only).
Electrophysiology—All currents were recorded in excised patch configuration at room temperature (22–25 °C). Pipette resistance was typically 2– 4 megaohms. Extracellular solution contained 160 mM MeSO3K, 10 mM Hϩ-HEPES, and 2 mM MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.0 with MeSO3H. High resistances seals were formed in a bath solution of ND-96. Intracellular solutions with different free Ca2ϩ were made by mixing 160 mM MeSO3K and 10 mM Hϩ-HEPES with Ca(MeS)2 and 5 mM HEDTA (for 10 ␮M) or 5 mM EGTA (for 0 ␮M). Free Ca2ϩ was estimated by the EGTAETC program (E. McCleskey, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR) with the pH adjusted to 7.0. The tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) or iberiotoxin (IbTX) solution was made by adding 20 mM TEA or 100 nM IbTX into the extracellular solution, and the lidocaine derivative QX-314 solution was made by adding 2 mM QX-314 into the intracellular solution. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
The Immunofluorescence Imaging of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with c-Myc-tagged channels and plated on poly-D-lysine-coated chambers. The next day cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. For cell permeabilization, 0.2% Triton X-100 was added for 5 min. After blocking for 1 h with 5% goat serum, cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-human c-Myc antibody (1:150) for 5 h, washed, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (HϩL) (1:100) for 1 h. All the experiments were performed at room temperature (about 25 °C). We took advantage of the high

numeric aperture objective (APO⅐100 OHR, NA ϭ 1.65, Olympus) to take high-resolution fluorescence images of the transfected HEK293 cells. Excitation light from a fiber optical coupled monochromator (Polychrome IV; TILL Photonics GmbH, Germany) was passed through a shutter that opened only during camera exposure. The wavelength selection and switch were controlled by the image acquisition software (TILL vision 4.0; Till Photonics GmbH). Images were acquired with a cooled CCD (PCO SensiCam) with a pixel size of 0.067 ␮m at the specimen plane. Images were viewed, processed, and analyzed in TILL Vision (TILL Photonics), Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems), and IMAGE J (National Institutes of Health). The exposure time was 2000 ms, and the percentage of fluorescent intensity was calculated from the target cells.
Data Analysis—Data were analyzed with IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), Clampfit (Axon Instruments, Foster city, CA), SigmaPlot (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL), and QuB software package (State University of New York at Buffalo). Unless stated otherwise, all data are plotted as the means Ϯ S.D. (n Ն 4), although error bars were often smaller than the symbol size; the V50-[Ca2ϩ]i curves of mSlo1 and its mutants were analyzed by a two-way analysis of variance test (factor A, [Ca2ϩ]i; factor B, mutation), and differences in their values were considered significant at a probability of Յ0.05. The single channels were recorded with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and PULSE and PULSEFIT software (HEKA Elektronic, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany), sampled at 20 kHz, and filtered to 10 kHz. Macropatch currents were filtered at 3 kHz. Single-channel currents were analyzed and simulated with QuB software from SUNY at Buffalo. Idealization was done using the segmentation k-means algorithm after digital low-pass filtering to 10 kHz. Kinetic modeling of the idealized intervals was done using the maximum interval likelihood method.
The G-V curves for activation were generated from steadystate or tail currents, converted to conductance, and then fitted by the single Boltzmann function with the form

G/Gmax ϭ ͑1 ϩ exp ͑͑V Ϫ V50͒/␬͒͒Ϫ1

where V50 is the voltage at which the conductance (G) is half the maximum conductance (Gmax), and ␬ is a factor affecting the steepness of activation.

Protein Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Simulation—All the MD simulations of membrane proteins in this study were carried out with the phospholipid bilayer solvated by water to provide the optimum environment. All of the wild type mSlo1, L312F, and L312I mutation models (only S5-P-S6) were constructed by homology modeling using modeler 9v2. The template was the crystal structure KCSA (PDB code 1BL8). A pre-equilibrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (POPC) bilayer with 274 lipid molecules was obtained from VMD 1.8.6, and the protein was embedded in the pre-equilibrated POPC lipid bilayer with the main axis along the z direction of bilayer POPC membrane. A cylindrical hole was made in the center of the bilayer by removing lipids whose P atoms fell within 2.0 Å of the above models. These whole systems were solvated (TIP3) and ionized in the presence of 160 mM KCl on both sides of the POPC membrane. A short MD simulation with a radially acting repulsive force was used to drive any remaining atoms out of the cylinder and into the bilayer. An initial minimization process was conducted for a 1-ns period to remove the bad contacts of intramolecular residues and between models and POPC molecules. The final production of MD simulations was performed for 2 ns to produce final equilibrated conformation. All of the simulations were using the Amber 8 suites (15) on a 66-CPU Dawning TC4000L cluster (Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The ff99 force field (Parm99) was applied throughout the energy minimization and MD simulations.
RESULTS
The pore domains of many Kϩ channels share identical amino acid sequences in the selectivity filter and a glycine residue in the inner helix (supplemental Fig. 1A) that may act as a gating hinge (10). Although this homology suggests that key structural elements of the permeation pathway are conserved, the pores of different Kϩ channels also contain unique features that may underlie differences in permeation and gating properties. For example, the inner helix of Shaker-family channels (e.g. Kv1.2) bends at a PVP sequence (supplemental Fig. 1A) that is lacking in other Kϩ channels, resulting in a differences in pore geometry and interaction among pore-lining residues (11, 16). Likewise, the BK channel contains, adjacent to the putative glycine hinge, an additional glycine (supplemental Fig. 1A) that is implicated in gating (10) and could potentially account for unique properties of the BK channel pore by conferring increased flexibility to the inner helix.
To help determine whether the BK channel pore structure deviates from that of other Kϩ channels near the putative gating hinge, we compared the arrangement of pore-lining residues in three Kϩ channels of known structure (supplemental Fig. 1, B–D). The crystal structures of KcsA, MthK, and KV1.2 suggest that two consecutive hydrophobic pore-lining residues after the putative glycine hinge, equivalent to Leu-312 and Phe-315 in the BK channel, may interact between adjacent subunits (Ile100/Phe-103 in KcsA; Ile-84/Phe-87 in MthK; Val-399/Ile-402 in KV1.2) because they come within an average contact distance of 4 Å (supplemental Fig. 1, B–D). The location of these resi-

dues, intracellular to the gating hinge and in different subunits, suggests their relative position and interaction could change during channel gating. For example, they may interact more strongly in the closed than the open conformation, as suggested by their closer apposition in KcsA (closed) versus MthK or Kv1.2 (open). Consistent with this possibility in BK channels, we found previously that that substitution of leucine at position 312 with alanine (L312A) markedly increases open probability, unlike mutation of an adjacent presumptive pore-lining residue (L309A) (14), suggesting Leu-312 could be involved in a statedependent interaction. In the present study we examined in more detail the roles of Leu-312 and its potential interaction partner Phe-315 in BK channel gating.
Leu-312 Mutations Enhance BK Channel Activation—Using site-directed mutagenesis, we probed the role of Leu-312 in BK channel gating. Representative current traces and their corresponding conductance-voltage (G-V) curves are plotted for wild type (WT) mSlo1 (Fig. 1A) and seven mutants (Fig. 1, B–H) at different [Ca]i, from 0 to 2 mM. With the exception of a hydrophobic substitution (L312F, Fig. 1B) that had a slight effect on steady-state activation compared with the WT, every mutation tested shifted G-V relations to more negative voltages in the presence or absence of Ca2ϩ, in some cases by hundreds of millivolts (Fig. 1, C–H). This marked enhancement of channel activation tended to increase as the hydrophobicity and/or size of the side chain at position 312 was reduced, consistent with the possibility that Leu-312 is involved in a hydrophobic interaction that normally stabilizes the closed conformation.
Leu-312 Mutations Alter Ca2ϩ and Voltage Sensitivity—Mutations of Leu-312 not only facilitated channel opening but also differentially altered the Ca2ϩ and voltage sensitivity of steadystate activation. Shifts in the G-V to more negative voltages were generally accompanied by a reduction in G-V slope (Fig. 1); that is, a decrease in apparent voltage sensitivity. Some mutants in which G-Vs were shifted relative to the WT in 0 Ca2ϩ exhibited large additional shifts in response to Ca2ϩ, like the WT (L312I and L312W, Fig. 1, C–D). Surprisingly, however, mutations that produced the largest G-V shifts in 0 Ca2ϩ (L312C, L312V, L312S, L312Q) also abolished Ca2ϩ sensitivity such that G-Vs in different Ca2ϩ concentrations superimpose (Fig. 1, E–H).
To quantify the effects of Leu-312 mutation, the half-activation voltage (V50) and the change in V50 relative to 0 Ca2ϩ (⌬V50 ϭ V50([Ca2ϩ]) Ϫ V50(0 Ca2ϩ)) for each mutant were plotted as functions of Ca2ϩ concentration (Fig. 2). L312I and L312W both shifted V50 by approximately Ϫ100 mV relative to the WT in 0 Ca2ϩ (Fig. 2A) and exhibited Ca2ϩ-dependent changes in V50 over a similar concentration range as the WT (Fig. 2B). However, the maximal ⌬V50 values for these two mutants were different and suggest that L312I reduces Ca2ϩ-sensitivity. In the case of L312W, the magnitude of ⌬V50 was clearly greater than the WT at all [Ca2ϩ], albeit difficult to quantify accurately for Ca2ϩ concentrations Ն10 ␮M where V50 was shifted below the experimental voltage range (Fig. 1D). This enhanced response to Ca2ϩ probably reflects the reduced G-V slope of L312W. A reciprocal relationship between apparent charge (G-V slope) and ⌬V50 is expected based on the energetic additivity of Ca2ϩ- and voltage-dependent BK channel activation

(17). Therefore, an increased ⌬V50 of L312W does not necessarily indicate a change in the energetic efficacy of Ca2ϩ binding on channel opening. By contrast, L312I exhibited a significantly smaller ⌬V50 than the WT (p Ͻ 0.000003) despite a reduced G-V slope, implying a decrease in the efficacy of Ca2ϩ. Similarly, the lack of Ca2ϩ sensitivity exhibited by L312C, L312V, L312S, and L312Q (Fig. 2B) is remarkable because the G-Vs of these mutants are approximately half as steep as the WT (␬ Ͼ 51 mV/e-fold), which should accentuate any residual effect of Ca2ϩ on V50 in these mutants.
Effects of the Leu-312 Mutations on Activation and Deactivation Kinetics—Currents evoked with some of the less hydrophobic substitutions (L312C, L312V, L312S, L312Q) exhibited nearly instantaneous activation and deactivation (Fig. 1, E–H), likely reflecting that channels are open, even at the Ϫ180 mV pre-pulse voltage. To identify the property of these leak-like currents, two Kϩ channel blockers, QX-314 and TEA, were used for L312S and L312V (supplemental Fig. 2). Application of intracellular 2 mM QX-314 to inside-out patches blocked these currents almost completely in a reversible manner (supplemental Fig. 2A). Similarly, extracellular 20 mM TEA reversibly inhibited L312S and L312V currents in outside-out patches to a similar extent as the WT (supplemental Fig. 2B). Additionally, a selective inhibitor of BK channels, 100 nM iberiotoxin, was extracellularly applied to L312Q and blocked the currents almost completely (supplemental Fig. 3). Thus, we conclude that currents were indeed carried by mutant BK channels that are open at negative voltages.
The time constants of activation (␶a) and deactivation (␶d) for Ca2ϩinsensitive mutants L312C, L312V, L312S, and L312Q were much faster than the bandwidth of our recordings (100 kHz) and could not be determined (Fig. 1; supplemental Fig. 2). However, we were able to

possibility that this S6 residue participates in interactions that

Phe-315 mutations (F315A, F315G,

F315I, F315L, F315T) do not give

rise to measurable currents under

physiological conditions (e.g. F315I

(21)). To determine why this is the

case, we examined both the current

and surface expression of Myc-

tagged WT and F315A mutant

channels (see “Experimental Proce-

dures”). Surprisingly, F315A was

expressed in the plasma membrane

at a level equivalent to the WT

(FF315A/FWT ϭ 1.03, n ϭ 5), although it expressed no detectable

macroscopic current in excised

patches (Fig. 5A1), unlike the WT

(Fig. 1A). Only brief single channel

openings were observed for F315A

at 200 mV (Fig. 5A2). Thus, we infer

that the function rather than the

expression of F315A is impaired.

Fortunately, we discovered one

effects of individual mutations are as large as L312Q and F315Q. Therefore, we also tested for coupling of Leu-312 and Phe-315 by swapping the side chains at these positions. Consistent with the hypothesis that interaction between Leu-312 and Phe-315 holds channels closed, the double mutation L312F/F315L did not facilitate opening. Indeed the G-V curves (supplemental Fig. 4) were shifted to more positive voltages than the WT (V50 ϭ 184 Ϯ 4 mV, V50 ϭ 165 Ϯ 2 mV, V50 ϭ 98 Ϯ 1 mV, V50 ϭ 56 Ϯ 4 mV in the presence of 4, 10, 300, and 2000 ␮M Ca2ϩ), suggesting that the interaction is strengthened. Swapping residues is not necessarily expected to maintain a constant interaction because geometric constraints are also important. An observation supporting that the effect of L312F/F315L reflects interaction between these positions is that F315L, like most single mutations of F315, failed to express functional channels. Thus, the L312F mutation appears to partially rescue the function or expression of F315L despite the fact that L312F by itself has little or no effect on steady-state activation (Figs. 1, A and B, and 2).
Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Leu-312/Phe-315 Interaction (L-F Coupling)—To further examine whether Leu-312 interacted with Phe-315 directly, we turned to molecular dynamics simulation. Starting from an initial conformation of mSlo1 at the closed state, derived from the crystal structure of KcsA channel, we found that two residues of mSlo1, i.e. Leu-312 and Phe-315, could constitute a tight

The single-channel currents of L312S (A) were obtained from inside-out patches at voltages as indicated in the presence of 0 [Ca2ϩ]i. All the single-channel currents were filtered at 10 kHz. The dashed line labeled with a letter c or o represents the closed or open level, respectively. Amplitude histograms of currents and dwell-time distributions are shown for L312S (A). Both the open and closed time constants were best fitted to a biexponential function with the software QuB. Time constants with their relative weights are plotted for L312S (B). The open circles are for the slow closed/open time constants, the filled circles are for the fast closed/open time constants, the open triangles are for the weight of the slow closed/open time constants, and the filled triangles are for the weight of the fast closed/open time constants. C, the single-channel current-voltage (I-V) curves are plotted for mSlo1 alone, L312S, L312Q, L312V, and F315Q as indicated. Levels of single-channel currents were measured by eye.
FIGURE 8. The effects of volume and hydrophobicity on V50. The three-dimensional plots among V50, [Ca2ϩ]i, and volume (A) or hydrophobicity (B) are plotted for each mutant. The values of volume (Å3)/hydrophobicity (arbitrary units) are: 89/Ϫ0.55 for serine, 108.5/0.17 for cysteine, 140/0.91 for valine, 143.8/Ϫ0.91 for glutamine, 166.7/1.25 for isoleucine, 166.7/1.22 for leucine, 189.9/1.92 for phenylalanine, and 227.8/0.5 for tryptophan (26, 27).

substituted amino acid (26, 27). Again, V50 goes up and down with increased hydrophobicity or volume of the substituted amino acid, suggesting that neither parameter alone can account for the G-V shift. Indeed, the GV curves of L312I are shifted by Ϫ50 to Ϫ80 mV relative to the WT at all the Ca2ϩ concentrations even though Leu and Ile have the same hydropathy index and volume. Therefore, we conclude that the specific structural conformation, as in L-F coupling, is also critical to channel gating.
How Can Intersubunit Coupling Structure Keep the BK Channel Pore Closed?—Among the Leu-312 mutations, only L312F can also maintain the G-V curves similar to that of WT mSlo1 probably because of the strong ␲-␲ interaction between two aromatic rings. Although isoleucine lacks one methyl at the end of its side chain compared with leucine side chain, its hydrophobicity is similar to that of leucine. However, such a tiny difference makes Ile-312 unable to form a tight interaction with Phe315 and leads to significant changes in gating. Just because of limitations in the length, symmetry, and hydrophobicity of side chains, Leu-312 mutations such as cysteine, glutamine, serine, and valine residues could seriously disrupt the intersubunit coupling structure and lead to an ostensible “leak” current. In addition, the aromatic ring of the amino acid Phe-315 is equally essential to keep the regular structure and function of BK channels. Such importance was demonstrated by the glutamine substitution F315Q, which also led to a “permanently-open,” Ca2ϩ-insensitive channel. Therefore, the L-F structure of mSlo1 provides a model for us to gain an insight into the intersubunit coupling function in BK-type channels.
How Do Leu-312 Mutations Eliminate Ca2ϩ Sensitivity?—In terms of the allosteric model of BK channel gating, it is impossible to account for a complete lack of Ca2ϩ sensitivity, as observed for L312C, L312V, L312S, L312Q, without reducing

the allosteric factor C to unity or increasing the Ca2ϩ dissociation constants (KC, KO) far above the experimental range (2 mM). Thus, these mutations may disrupt interactions between Ca2ϩ sensors and the gate. Likewise, a decoupling of voltage sensors from the gating could cause the apparent two-state behavior in single-channel kinetics of L312S. However, an interesting alternative possibility is that, by disrupting interaction of Leu-312 with Phe-315, mutations such as L312S cause the pore gate to be permanently opened, and the residual flickering closings observed at negative voltages represent a property of the selectivity filter. In this way the channel could become Ca2ϩ-insensitive without requiring that Ca2ϩ sensors become decoupled from the pore gate. Rather, the influence of Ca2ϩ and voltage sensors may be reduced because the open probability of the pore gate is saturated.
