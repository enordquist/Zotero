ABSTRACT We have developed an all-atom free-energy force ﬁeld (PFF01) for protein tertiary structure prediction. PFF01 is based on physical interactions and was parameterized using experimental structures of a family of proteins believed to span a wide variety of possible folds. It contains empirical, although sequence-independent terms for hydrogen bonding. Its solventaccessible surface area solvent model was ﬁrst ﬁt to transfer energies of small peptides. The parameters of the solvent model were then further optimized to stabilize the native structure of a single protein, the autonomously folding villin headpiece, against competing low-energy decoys. Here we validate the force ﬁeld for ﬁve nonhomologous helical proteins with 20–60 amino acids. For each protein, decoys with 2–3 A˚ backbone root mean-square deviation and correct experimental Cb–Cb distance constraints emerge as those with the lowest energy.

INTRODUCTION
Ab initio protein tertiary structure prediction (PSP) remains among the most important outstanding problems of biophysical chemistry (Baker and Sali, 2001; Moult et al., 2001; Schonbrunn et al., 2002). The many complementary proposals for PSP span a wide range of representations (Go and Scheraga, 1976; Nemethy et al., 1992; Ulrich et al., 1997; Zhou and Karplus, 1999; Simons et al., 1997, 1999; Pillardy et al., 2001; Liwo et al., 2002; Nanias et al., 2003) of the protein conformation, ranging from coarse-grained models to atomic resolution. The choice of representation often correlates with the methodology employed in structure prediction, ranging from empirical potentials for coarsegrained models (Go and Scheraga, 1976; Ulrich et al., 1997; Nanias et al., 2003) to complex atom-based potentials that directly approximate the physical interactions in the system (Duan and Kollman, 1998; Snow et al., 2002). The latter offer insights into the mechanism of protein structure formation and promise better transferability (Vasquez et al., 1994), but their use incurs large computational costs that has conﬁned all-atom protein structure prediction to small peptides (Snow et al., 2002; Simmerling et al., 2002; Schug et al., 2003) and proteins (Hansmann, 2004; Herges and Wenzel, 2004; Schug et al., 2004). Recent evaluations of different approaches to PSP found that empirical, homology-based methods outperform the ab initio methods (Lattman, 2001; Bonneau et al., 2001), but that there is still much room for improvement in the quality of the predictions of all methods.
It has been one of the central paradigms of protein folding that proteins in their native conformation are in thermodynamic equilibrium with their environment (Anﬁnsen, 1973). Exploiting this characteristic the structure of the protein can

be predicted by locating the global minimum of its freeenergy surface (Liwo et al., 2002; Schug et al., 2003; Onuchic et al., 1997) without recourse to the folding dynamics (Vila et al., 2004; Herges and Wenzel, 2004). This approach is potentially much more efﬁcient than the direct simulation of the folding process. Simulation by molecular dynamics elucidates the folding dynamics of the protein explicitly (Garcia and Onuchic, 2003) but strains presently available computational resources and will remain inapplicable to large proteins in the foreseeable future. For many questions regarding only the folded structure of the protein, PSP based on global optimization of a free-energy model may offer a viable alternative approach, provided that a suitable parameterization of the free energy of the protein in its environment exists and that the global optimum of this free-energy surface can be found with sufﬁcient accuracy (Li and Scheraga, 1987).
PSP by optimization requires an accurate, yet tractable model for the low-energy portion of the free-energy surface of the protein and efﬁcient optimization techniques which can reliably determine its global minimum. Despite a steady increase in available computational power, PSP remains one of the grand computational challenges, which constrains the choice of free-energy parameterizations. The free-energy model must describe the internal energy of the system and the entropy of both the molecule and the surrounding solvent. The major contribution to entropy differences among metastable conﬁgurations with long lifetimes and to the native conformation stems from changes in the free energy of the solvent and possibly the side chains. Changes in the solvent free energy may be approximated by simple implicit models based on the solvent-accessible surface area of the individual atoms (Eisenberg and McLachlan, 1986). Such terms also approximately account for the changes in the side-chain entropy upon burial and other nonbonded interactions with ﬁctitious solvent molecules.

A Force Field for Helical Proteins

3101

Here we investigate a strategy for all-atom protein structure prediction (Schug et al., 2003; Herges and Wenzel, 2004) in a minimal thermodynamic approach for a number of helical proteins. We report the rational development of an all-atom free-energy force ﬁeld for proteins (PFF01), which is primarily based on physical interactions with important empirical, though sequence-independent, corrections. This force ﬁeld was rationally optimized to stabilize the native conformations of the autonomously folding headpiece of the villin protein (PDB code 1VII), which was previously investigated in all-atom simulations using the AMBER (Duan and Kollman, 1998) and ECEPP/2 (Hansmann, 2002) force ﬁelds. We already demonstrated the reproducible and predictive folding of two proteins, the structurally conserved 40-amino-acid headpiece of the HIV accessory protein (1F4I) (Herges and Wenzel, 2004) and the 20-amino-acid Trp-cage protein (1L2Y) (Schug et al., 2003) with PFF01. Here we argue that PFF01 stabilizes the native conformations of three other proteins: the 53-amino-acid headpiece of protein A (Snow et al., 2002; Gouda et al., 1992) (Residues: 1–53) folds into a three-helix bundle and has been investigated using empirical and all-atom potentials (Zhou and Karplus, 1999; Shea et al., 1999; Vila et al., 2004). The engrailed homeodomain (1ENH) from Drosophila melanogaster (Clarke et al., 1994) is a prototypical a-helical protein that was recently investigated with respect to its folding stability and pathway in both simulation and protein-engineering experiments (Mayor et al., 2003). The bacterial ribosomal protein L20 (1GYZ) is a recently investigated 60-amino-acid protein (Raibaud et al., 2002), one of the smallest to fold into a stable four-helix bundle. We ﬁnd for each of the proteins that a near-native conformation emerges as lowest in energy when compared to independently generated low-energy decoys. PFF01 thus emerges as a promising free-energy force ﬁeld to explore techniques for all-atom protein structure prediction for a family of helical proteins. The decoys that were generated in this study may be used to validate force ﬁelds other than PFF01 for protein structure prediction.

METHODS

Free-energy model

Due to the complexity of protein interactions, force-ﬁeld design must balance the quality of the representation and the computational demands of its evaluation (Vajda et al., 1997). PFF01 represents all atoms individually (with the exception of hydrogen in CHn groups). During the folding process we consider only variations of the dihedral angles fuig of the backbone and the side chains, while keeping all other angles and bond-lengths ﬁxed. The energy is parameterized as

using established, physically motivated contributions with an emphasis on the simplicity of their numerical evaluation. Here rij denotes the distance between atoms i and j, qi the partial charge on atom i. Ai designates the surface of atom i that is exposed to a ﬁctitious solvent. The latter is calculated as the area of a sphere with radius Ri (from the potential type associated with the atom) that is accessible to ﬁctitious solvent molecules with a radius of 1.4 A˚ .
The atoms of the peptide are classiﬁed into potential-types according to their chemical characteristics as described in Table 1 (Avbelj and Moult, 1995a). The partial charges qi and screening constants Dij were taken from an adapted version (J. Moult, 1999, Electrostatic parameters for proteins; private communication) of an established electrostatic parameterization for proteinps ﬃﬃﬃ(ﬃﬃAﬃﬃﬃvﬃﬃbelj and Moult, 1995b). The Lennard-Jones radii (Rij ¼ RiiRjj) were derived in a potential-of-mean-force approach by ﬁtting the experimentally observed short-range (2–5 A˚ ) radial distributions of a set of 138 proteins that are believed to span a wide range of possible folds (Abagyan and Totrov, 1994). The ﬁnal set of radii (see Table 2) reduced the number of clashes in native conformations by 99% in comparison to a Lennard-Jones parameterization taken from the OPLS force ﬁeld (Jorgensen and McDonald, 1998) using a uniform value of VLJ ¼ 10 cal/mol.
A model for main-chain hydrogen bonding, which governs secondary structure formation, must incorporate both electrostatic effects originating from the dipole-dipole interactions, as well as the alignment of the hydrogen mediating the bond with respect to the donor and acceptor groups (Sippl et al., 1984). To model the latter we have developed a corrective term,

where r˜ij is the distance between H and O of the amino and carboxyl groups, nij is the NHO angle, and d the angle between the CO and NH dipoles. The distributions of these parameters for the main-chain hydrogen bonds extracted from experimental protein structures are shown in Fig. 1. The radial dependence is modeled according to R(r) ¼ s2.4, 0.075(r), where sX;WðxÞ ¼ 12ð1 ÿ tanhðxÿWXÞÞ: Fig. 1 c indicates an additional correlation between the angles n and d, which is included in the angle-dependent term as

This parameterization permits a continuous variation from a pure dipoledipole model (X ¼ 0) to the pure PMF model (X ¼ 1) and represents short helix fragments best with the choice X ¼ 0.25 and V0 ¼ 2.12 cal/mol A˚ . To determine optimal values for these parameters we optimized short helical fragments with several choices of the parameters and chose the values that stabilized structures closest to the experimental conformations. Solvation effects are described in a solvent-accessible surface area model that was ﬁtted to the enthalpies of solvation of the Gly-X-Gly family of peptides (Eisenberg and McLachlan, 1986; Fauchere and Pliska, 1983) (see column sIi in Table 2, all si ¼ 1).
Optimization method
Monte Carlo with minimization has been used to locate the global minima of many complex potential energy surfaces (Li and Scheraga, 1987; Doyle and Wales, 1996; Wales and Doyle, 1997). The minimization step simpliﬁes the potential energy surface (PES), by mapping each conformation to a nearby local minimum. The increase of efﬁciency of Monte Carlo with minimization in comparison to the Monte Carlo method (Metropolis et al., 1953) on the original potential energy surface strongly depends on the average energy gain in the minimization procedure.

conﬁguration replaces the starting conﬁguration according to a threshold

annealing simulations, changes in the dihedral angles are generated

randomly for both side-chain and main-chain dihedral angles. Global moves

for the main-chain dihedral angles are additionally generated from a library

(Avbelj and Moult, 1995a).

Free-energy surface topology
The topology of the low-energy part of the free-energy surface was analyzed in a decoy tree (Brooks et al., 2001; Becker and Karplus, 1997) that groups conformations in a given energy range into families. As a distance measure, we used backbone root mean-square deviation (BRMSD). The tree was constructed from all decoys (local minima that differ by at least 1 A˚ BRMSD from all other decoys) encountered in the simulations for a sequence of equidistant energies E0; E1 . . . ; starting with the energy of the best conformation. A decoy with energy below En that has ,3 A˚ BRMSD to the decoy of just one family at the next lower energy level En–1 is included into that family. If a decoy is associated with more than one family, the corresponding families are united. If it belongs to no existing family a new family containing just this decoy is created. For each family we draw a vertical line in the energy window between En–1 and En and merge the lines for the energy En where the families are united. This analysis results in an inverted tree-like structure that illustrates the energetic order and degree of

structural similarity of conformations via their family association. For a force ﬁeld that stabilizes the native structure, the native family is represented by the branch of the tree that extends the furthest downward. In force ﬁelds that stabilize non-native structures, perturbations in the parameters can be used to rebalance the lower portion of the tree.

RESULTS
Force-ﬁeld optimization
Using the modiﬁed basin hopping technique we generated ;10,000 decoys for 1VII starting from both the NMR and stretched conformations, which resulted in many different conformations with energies below that of native decoys (Herges et al., 2004). We thus reﬁtted the solvation parameters against improved data for the free energies of solvation (Sharp et al., 1991) using Sharke-Rupley (Sharke and Rupley, 1973) side-chain surfaces (sOi in Table 2). We reoptimized all low energy decoys of the previous simulations, which reduced the number (but did not eliminate the existence) of non-native decoys with energies below the NMR structure. We grouped these conformations into a decoy tree (Herges and Wenzel, 2004) and identiﬁed the set of most important unique competing structures to the native conformation.
The resulting free-energy landscape is illustrated in Fig. 2. All low energy decoys correspond to three-helix structures with nearly identical secondary content as the NMR structure. The decoy closest to the NMR structure (labeled N) has a backbone RMS deviation (BRMSD) of only 3.6 A˚ from the latter, but is not the global optimum of the PES. The global optimum is the three-helix structure labeled M in the ﬁgure, which has a BRMSD of 7.6 A˚ to the NMR decoy. The three helices in this structure have a different tertiary alignment than the NMR structure, with the direction of the last helix pointing in the opposite direction.
In a free-energy optimization approach, this failure to locate the correct global optimum points to a deﬁciency of the force ﬁeld. A similar result was recently obtained for the

same protein with the ECEPP/2 force ﬁeld, where a competing two-helix structure emerged as the lowest energy decoy (Lin et al., 2003). The villin headpiece also failed to fold in an earlier landmark MD simulation (Duan and Kollman, 1998), but it is unclear whether limitations in the folding time or deﬁciencies in the force ﬁeld were responsible.
Provided that the enumeration of metastable low energy structures of the free-energy surface in Fig. 2 is complete, small variations of force-ﬁeld parameters will shift the energies of the decoys with respect to one another, but not introduce new branches in the tree. One may therefore attempt to rationally optimize the force ﬁeld (Ulrich et al., 1997) to correctly fold the villin headpiece by computing the ‘‘gradient’’ of the energy differences between the terminal low-energy decoys with respect to the force-ﬁeld parameters to stabilize the NMR structure against all other conformations. Once the force-ﬁeld parameters have been modiﬁed, all low-energy decoys must be relaxed in the new force ﬁeld and the same procedure is repeated until either the NMR structure emerges as the global minimum of the PES or several competing structures emerge with the same energy but gradients of opposite sign.

We thus optimized the force ﬁeld to stabilize the NMR structure, concentrating on the parameters most difﬁcult to obtain from ﬁrst principles. The solvation model attempts to capture a whole host of complicated effects, including ion solvation, the hydrophobic effect, and side-chain entropy, in a very simple functional form. The translation of its experimental basis, the Gly-X-Gly transfer enthalpies from water to either vapor or octanol, into atomic solvation parameters depends strongly on the choice of the underlying peptide conformations. For these reasons, the free energies of solvation per unit area are the least-known parameters in the model. We therefore introduced amino-acid speciﬁc prefactors si into the solvation term to stabilize the NMR decoys against the competing low-energy structures following the strategy outlined above. In each iteration of this process all low-energy conformations of the decoy set, which ultimately included in excess of 76,000 structures grouped in to 14,000 decoy families, were relaxed. Using sPHE ¼ 1.2, sMET ¼ 0.9, sLEU ¼ 0.8, sTRP ¼ 0.6, and all other as si ¼ 1, we ultimately arrived at a force ﬁeld that stabilized an NMR decoy with 3.5 A˚ BRMSD against all competing structures (see Figs. 3 and 4).

Force-ﬁeld validation
Using PFF01, we previously reproducibly and predictably folded two proteins, the 20-amino-acid Trp-cage protein (Neidigh et al., 2002; Simmerling et al., 2002; Schug et al., 2003) and the 40-amino-acid headpiece of the HIV accessory protein (PDB code 1F4I) (Herges and Wenzel, 2004). 1F4I is a three-helix protein with no homology to 1VII and folded

The resulting free-energy surface is illustrated by the decoy tree shown in Fig. 3. The variation of the solvation parameters lead to a ﬂattening of the free-energy surface, which now has seven almost-isoenergetic non-native terminal branches. The decoys associated with the terminal branches of the tree are shown in Fig. 4. There are now ﬁve 3-helix and two 2-helix structures at the bottom of their respective branches of the tree. The secondary structure, with the lowest energy conformations along with their BRMSDs and energies, are listed in Table 3. One notes a distinct propensity for the formation of helices in those regions where the NMR structure forms helices 1 and 3. The central helix occurs less often and leads to misfolded decoys reminiscent of the two-helix structures found in Lin et al. (2003). The energy spectrum shows a gap of 1 kcal/mol between the NMR decoy and the next competing structure, and becomes nearly continuous with increasing energy. An

Only structures which differ by at least 1 A˚ BRMSD from all other structures were included in the list. For each structure the free energy, its BRMSD from the native conformation and its secondary structure content, as computed by CSSP, is shown. The secondary structure content of the native conformation is shown on top for comparison. The labels refer to the decoys associated with the terminal branches of the decoy tree in Fig. 4.

reproducibly in 6 of 20 independent simulations. Competing low-energy conformers had similar secondary structure, but differed in the relative orientation of the helices. Trp-cage has a helix-turn-coil structure with signiﬁcantly less helical content and exhibits two-stage folding on a 4-ms timescale. The tertiary structure of the protein was predicted correctly in 8 of 25 stochastic tunneling simulations (Wenzel and Hamacher, 1999; Schug et al., 2003); an analysis of the misfolded structures suggests that the formation of both helix segments is required to sterically permit the formation of the Trp-cage that stabilizes the tertiary structure of the native conformations. These data suggested that PFF01 may correctly predict the structure of a larger protein family.
We therefore investigated the transferability of the force ﬁeld to three other helical proteins by extended decoy generation starting both from the NMR and from randomized structures. We ﬁrst investigated Staphylococcus aureus protein A (PDB code 1BDD), where we selected the conserved helical section spanning 53 amino acids. Protein A was recently investigated with knowledge-based potentials (Zhou and Karplus, 1999), replica-exchange molecular dynamics (Garcia and Onuchic, 2003), and all-atom models (Vila et al., 2004). Fig. 5 illustrates the distribution of energy versus BRMSD for the random/NMR decoys in black/blue for the best of 48,000 generated decoys. The overlap in energy/BRMSD between the two datasets suggests that the random simulations covered a substantial fraction of the lowenergy free-energy landscape of the protein. The conforma-

tions lowest in energy were NMR decoys that deviated ;2 A˚ in BRMSD from the NMR structure, which deﬁnes the resolution of the force ﬁeld. The best folded structure (diamond in Fig. 5) was ,1 kcal/mol higher in energy than

Decoys obtained from randomized starting conditions are represented by solid symbols; decoys obtained starting from the NMR structure are represented by open symbols. The best estimates for the global optimum of the free-energy surface have only 2 A˚ BRMSD from the NMR structure. The diamond (see arrow) designates the best freely ‘‘folded’’ decoy for protein A, indicating that the efﬁciency of the optimization method, not the force ﬁeld, is the limiting factor in folding larger proteins.

investigated so far. Its best NMR decoy deviates only 1.6 A˚ BRMSD from the NMR conformation, thus approaching experimental resolution. As for the other proteins, we found no structures lower in energy than the NMR structure; the best freely folded decoys approached the NMR structure to within 5 A˚ BRMSD and were 2 kcal/mol higher in energy.

the best NMR decoy, which illustrates the required energy resolution of the optimization method for this protein. Stochastic optimization method cannot resolve the global optimum of the free-energy surface with absolute certainty; one must thus rely on repeated simulations to obtain reliable results for the relative energies of near-native and non-native decoys. Fig. 5 demonstrates the good overlap between the folded structure and the unrelaxed NMR conformation. The top section of Table 4 lists the energies of the best freely folded conformations and their deviation from the relaxed/ unrelaxed NMR structures, respectively. Notably, all lowenergy structures are very similar in their secondary structure content; almost all are three-helix structures. The lowest nonnative decoys have a BRMSD of .8 A˚ but differ ,2 kcal/ mol in energy, which illustrates the demands on the resolution of the optimization method. As an alternate measure of structural similarity we have compared the Cb–Cb distances of the native and the decoy structure (Fig. 7). We ﬁnd that 65% (80%) of the Cb–Cb distances of the decoy agree to within 1.5 (2.25) A˚ to the corresponding distances in the native structure. For the misfolded decoy, these values drop to 35% (44%) respectively, despite the fact that both conformations have nearly identical secondary structure.
Motivated by a recent combined experimental and computational effort to elucidate its folding dynamics we investigated 1ENH, a 52-amino-acid, three-helix protein. As for 1BDD, NMR decoys were lowest in energy, which stabilizes the native structure to within 2.3 A˚ BRMSD. Freely folded decoys approached these conformations to 2.9 A˚ (third entry from the bottom of the second section of Table 4), but failed to reach sufﬁciently low energy to predictably fold the protein. Among the non-native decoys two important families at ;6 and 8.5 A˚ BRMSD emerged, which had very similar secondary structure. In our validation study, we also investigated the bacterial ribosomal protein (PDB code 1GYZ) as an example of a four-helix protein. With 60 amino acids, this was the largest protein we have

DISCUSSION
Following the thermodynamic hypothesis (Anﬁnsen, 1973), which stipulates that a protein is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, its native structure can be predicted as the global optimum of a suitable free-energy force ﬁeld. Here we have described the rational parameterization of a free-energy force ﬁeld, PFF01, for all-atom protein structure prediction.
Our all-atom representation of the protein permits the parameterization of the free-energy landscape on the basis of physical interactions that are well understood for smaller systems. Parameterizations based on physical interactions promise transferability, in particular to nonphysiological environments, and opportunities for rational development of the methodology in comparison to purely knowledge-based potentials. Our results suggest that a force ﬁeld based on physical interactions in proteins beneﬁts from the inclusion of heuristic corrections for complex interactions, e.g., screening effects of the implicit solvent and hydrogen bonding. The use of physical interactions in all-atom representations incurs a large computational cost when compared to more coarse-grained, or homology-based models. The elimination of explicit solvent degrees of freedom is a prerequisite for the applicability of the optimization approach. This work demonstrates that the entropic contributions arising from the contact with the solvent can be approximated by simple, computationally efﬁcient models for realistic systems.
We ﬁnd that PFF01 stabilizes the near-native conformation of several nonhomologous helical proteins against large independently generated decoy sets. One cannot overemphasize the importance of the interplay of optimization methods and force-ﬁeld validation. Rational force-ﬁeld development mandates the ability to generate decoys that fully explore competing low-energy conformations to the native state. The success of different optimization strategies depends strongly on the structure of the potential energy surface. As a result the development of efﬁcient optimization techniques for all-atom protein structure prediction depends on the availability of a force ﬁeld that stabilizes native conformations of proteins with appreciable hydrophobic cores. For helical proteins the bottleneck in ab initio all-atom structure prediction now lies in the development of optimization strategies that signiﬁcantly increase the system size that can be treated with present day computational resources. Force-ﬁeld validation for larger proteins, for which low-energy decoys are difﬁcult to generate

FIGURE 7 Distance map comparing the Cb–Cb distances of the native structure with that of the best decoy (left) and the second-best decoy (right) of 1BDD. A pixel in row i and column j of the ﬁgure indicates the difference in the Cb–Cb distance of the native and the measured structure. Solid and shaded squares indicate that the Cb–Cb distances of the native and the other structure differ by ,1.5 (2.25) A˚ , respectively. Open squares indicate larger deviations.
at the all-atom level, may thus employ existing sets of independently generated decoys (Nanias et al., 2003).
Our results indicate that for helical proteins the bottleneck toward the treatment of larger systems is the efﬁciency of the optimization method, rather than the quality of the force ﬁeld. The availability of PFF01 provides a framework for the development of new optimization strategies for larger molecules.
We hope that the rational strategy of all-atom force-ﬁeld optimization pursued in this project offers a valuable contribution to protein structure prediction in general. Even if the available computational resources remain insufﬁcient in the foreseeable future to fold large proteins, all-atom force ﬁelds may be used to discriminate and reﬁne among conformations generated on the basis of other techniques, in particular with coarse-grained, or knowledge-based potentials (Nanias et al., 2003).
