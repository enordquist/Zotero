Intriguingly, the time course of extinction varied in our study, depending on whether the agent was predator- or arearelated. Spider populations on islands with predators never increased above initial (introduction) sizes. In contrast, among predator-free islands, spiders on small islands frequently showed rapid population growth initially, even sometimes outstripping growth on large islands (22). Nonetheless, all those populations eventually became extinct, in contrast to some on large islands which have now persisted for 12 years since the initial introduction. Given possible
variation in both natural and human-in-
duced immigration rates, such differences allow insight into the temporal dynamics of
species preservation.

8. In the second introduction, individuals were released at three closely adjacent sites in groups of five, one of
which sites was the same as in the first introduction.
9. To assay survival, we first identified each resident female on the five islands still having them by tagging her web and noting her body size. After 4 days, when censusing for survival of introduced spiders, we did not include individuals in or near tagged webs that were the same size as the appropriate residents.
10. Introductions and yearly censuses were done in May or very late April, 1982 through 1987. Census methods were as described (4, 5).
11. P values are from contrasts (df = 1, 12) in repeatedmeasures analysis of variance (ANOVA), one-tailed tests. Frequencies were arcsine-square root transformed before analysis. Sequential Bonferroni tests (16) at a = 0.05 were used to adjust for multiple comparisons; all P values given in the paper are raw (that is, uncorrected for multiple comparisons). Because propagule size and certain other conditions (12) were different for the two phases, separate analyses of survival were also done (contrast P = 0.003, 0.215 for the first and second hypothesis, respectively, for Phase 1; P = 0.016, >0.5, respectively, for Phase 2); the first hypothesis in each phase is significant with a sequential Bonferroni test. Nonetheless, in repeated measures, neither the phase (P 0.507) nor phase-treatment (P = 0.548) source of variation was significant, causing rejection of hypotheses of survival differences associated with the two phases. All analyses in this paper were
done with SAS software.
12. Although other explanations are possible, weak evidence exists that spiders apparently remaining from the first introduction had a positive effect: Islands with a large number (20 to 35) of already-established

spiders had greater survivorship than did the other islands without lizards (mean survival frequencies 0.93 versus 0.70; equal variances t = 1.92, twotailed test, P = 0.091). 13. T. W.

Mauchly's Sphericity Test is not significant (P = 0.137), allowing acceptance of sphericity, so we report unadjusted P values [as recommended in R. J. Freund, R. C. ULittell, P. C. Spector, SAS system for Linear Models (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, 1986); our design, in which time is the repeated factor, follows the example in this source (see chapter 6)]. The Huynh-Feldt (H-F) Epsilon is very high (0.961), and the H-F adjusted probabilities are very close to those we report. Multivariate repeated-measures evaluations (Wilks') are not significant [in the order given in text, P = 0.230 (df = 4, 9),P = 0.376 (df = 8,18), P = 0.158 (df = 4,9) and P = 0.600 (df = 4,9)], but for our design the multivariate procedure has statistical power below that recommended, and assuming sphericity allows one to use the univariate results [J. Stevens, Applied Multivariate Statistics for the Social Sciences (Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ, ed. 2, 1992)]. Unequal variances of the treatments implies that these ANOVAs should be interpreted cautiously. With the
use of the means of the five census times, separate F-tests lead to the conclusion that variances of the
two large-island types are unequal, whereas those of the two no-lizard types are not. The appropriate separate t tests give P = 0.025 and P = 0.071, respec-

tively, for the two contrasts. 18. However, the interaction between time and the con-

Demonstration of Positionally Disordered Water Within a Protein Hydrophobic Cavity by NMR
James A. Ernst, Robert T. Clubb, Huan-Xiang Zhou, Angela M. Gronenborn,* G. Marius Clore*
The presence and location of water of hydration (that is, bound water) in the solution structure of human interleukin-1 p (hlL-1P) was investigated with water-selective twodimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It is shown here that in addition to water at the surface of the protein and ordered internal water molecules involved in bridging hydrogen bonds, positionally disordered water is present within a large, naturally occurring hydrophobic cavity located at the center of the molecule. These water molecules of hydration have residency times in the range of 1 to 2 nanoseconds to 100 to 200 microseconds and can be readily detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Thus, large hydrophobic cavities in proteins may not be truly empty, as analysis of crystal structures appears to show, but may contain mobile water molecules that are crystallographically invisible but detectable by NMR.

WVater of hydration (that is, bound water)
has long been known to play an important structural and functional role in proteins (1). In particular, buried water molecules may stabilize protein structure by acting as bridges between protein hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, whereas surface water molecules located at the active site participate in catalysis and ligand recognition.

Experimentally, bound water can be detected either in the crystal state by x-ray and neutron diffraction or in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Only positionally ordered water molecules can be detected in crystal structures, as the observed electron density
represents a linear superposition of all the
atomic positions during the course of the experiment (which typically lasts many
hours). Thus, the detection of a water molecule at a given location in the crystal
structure, although independent of its residency time, requires that the potential of
mean force at this point has a well-defined

local minimum such that a water molecule
always returns to the same position, thereby giving rise to observable electron density (2). If this is not the case, the resulting electron density will be smeared and, as a result, undetectable. In this light, it is not
surprising that water molecules observed in
crystal structures are almost invariably hydrogen-bonded either directly or indirectly by means of a hydrogen-bonded water network to polar backbone or side chain groups of the protein (1,3). The detection of water molecules by NMR, on the other hand, does not require uniform ordering but is dependent only on the spatial proximity of
water protons to protons of the protein and the lifetime of the bound water (4, 5).
Although the interiors of proteins are generally well packed (6), the packing is not always perfect, which results in the presence of cavities (7). In addition, cavities have been generated artificially by replacement of larger side chains with smaller ones (8, 9). Although water molecules have been observed crystallographically in polar cavities, there is only one example of ordered water molecules in a small hydrophobic cavity (10). Indeed, all the hydrophobic cavities generated in T4 lysozyme ranging
in volume from 34 to 215 A3 appear to be
empty in the corresponding crystal structures (8). Likewise, analysis of the crystal
structures of a series of cavity-generating
mutants in ribonuclease A showed that cav-
ities with an apolar character are empty (9). These observations seem to be supported by recent measurements of solubility and vapor pressure, which suggest that it is unlikely that single water molecules enter small, nonpolar cavities in proteins (11). Here, we present an NMR analysis of bound water in

human interleukin-lp3 (hIL-113), a l3 sheet protein with a p3-trefoil fold (12) whose structure has been solved by both crystallography (13) and NMR (14).
Through-space interactions between aliphatic protons of '3C-labeled hIL-113 and
bound water were detected with the use of
two-dimensional (2D) '2C-filtered HOnuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE)-
'H-13C and HO20-rotating frame Over-
hauser enhancement (ROE)-'H-'3C het-
eronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra recorded at several mixing
times and temperatures (15). These experiments use low-power 1H pulses (70 to 100 Hz) to selectively invert the water reso-
nance and are very sensitive because the
slowly relaxing water is never saturated (16,
17). Each experiment consists of two inter-
leaved data sets in which the 'H water
magnetization lies either parallel (+z) or antiparallel (-z) to the magnetization of
the protein 'H resonances, which are
aligned along the +z direction before the
NOE and ROE mixing times. The differ-
ence between the two data sets provides a
protein-water NOE or ROE difference spec-
trum that contains cross-peaks arising solely
from interactions between protein and wa-
ter protons (16, 17). An example of two
regions of the 60-ms mixing time of the H20-NOE-'H-13C HSQC difference spec-
trum recorded at 35°C is shown in Fig. 1. Cross-peaks in these spectra may arise
from either a direct through-space interac-
tion between '3C-attached protein protons
and water protons separated by <5 A or by an indirect pathway involving an NOE or
ROE between '3C-attached protons and ex-
changeable protons of the protein (such as a hydroxyl group of Ser, Thr, and Tyr, the

E-NH3 group of Lys, or the guanidino group of Arg) followed by chemical exchange with water (4, 5). Over 200 cross-peaks could be
detected, 95 of which could be attributed to
a direct NOE or ROE interaction with bound water because the relevant protein protons were more than 5 A from any ex-
changeable groups. The locations of these protons abstracted to the directly bonded carbon atoms and superimposed on the backbone of hIL-113 are shown in Fig. 2. All
the observed NOEs are negative in sign,
indicating that the residence times of the
bound water molecules have to be greater
than -500 ps. Moreover, once the residence
time exceeds the rotational correlation time
(in this case, -8 ns) by a factor of >3, the NOE intensities will be independent of res-
idence time.
Analysis of the three independently
solved x-ray structures of hIL- 1B (13) re-
veals the presence of 26 conserved water
molecules, defined as water molecules
common to all three structures whose oxygen atoms have an average atomic root
mean square displacement of 1 A or less. Of these, 19 were potentially identifiable by NMR (that is, they are less than 5 A away from nonexchangeable protein pro-
tons that themselves are further than 5 A
away from potentially exchangeable protons), and 10 were actually observed (magenta in Fig. 2). These 10 water molecules are all involved in bridging backbone hydrogen bonds, and 7 of them were previously detected in 3D '5N-edited ROE spectra (5, 14).
Most interactions with bound water in
our experiments involved methyl groups. This is a result of their favorable spectral properties, namely narrow lines and high

The volume and surface area of the cavity, calculated with a probe radius of 1.4 A with the use of the program GRASP (30), are 125
and 137 A2, respectively. [This procedure when applied to the coordinates of T4 lysozyme and its cavity-generating mutants yields values for the cavity volumes and surface areas that are very similar to those cited in (8).] The coordinates are taken from (14), and the location of the crystallographically conserved water molecules from (13).

Fig. 2). It should also be noted that, just as in the case of the GATA-1-DNA complex (17) and human thioredoxin (18), all surface-exposed methyl groups are hydrated. The fact that most of these are not associated with water in the crystal structures simply reflects the fact that the hydration water is positionally disordered. For example, this may be due to rapid independent rotation of a water pentagon around a rotating methyl group (17). This result lends credence to the concept of hydrophobic hydration (19).
Examination of the hIL-11 structure revealed the presence of a large intemal hydrophobic cavity that, on the basis of the

NMR data, must be filled with water. It was
located at the center of the molecule
bounded by the six-stranded 1P barrel in the
front (strands 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12) and the remaining six strands at the rear (strands 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, and 11). The volume of the cavity varied from 75 to 95 A3 in the three
crystal structures (13) to 125 A3 in the
NMR structure (14). Thus, it can potentially accommodate two to four water mole-
cules if one assumes that the density of water within the cavity is the same as that of the bulk solvent (20). The residues pointing toward the cavity were entirely hydrophobic, and there were no potential backbone hydrogen bond donors or accep-
tors that could interact with water. NOEs to water were observed from the methyl pro-
tons of Leu'0, Leu'8, Leu26, Leu60, Leu69,
Leu80, Ile'22, and Val132; from the P-meth-
ylene protons of Leulo and Leu'8; from the y-methine protons of Leu'0, Leu'8, and Leu60; and from the 13-methine and y-methylene protons of Ile'22 (Fig. 3). In
addition to these residues, the aromatic
rings of Phe42, Phe112, and Phe'46 lined the
cavity. There were no NOEs observed between these three aromatic residues and water. This was a result of the rapid relaxation of aromatic protons in concert with strong coupling of aromatic carbons, which results in a large decrease in sensitivity relative to that of the methyl groups.
The internal cavity appeared to be emp-
ty in all three crystal structures of hIL-11.
This cannot be attributed to low occupancy of water molecules within the cavity. Under such circumstances, the water would not be observable either by crystallography or by NMR. For example, an occupancy of 10% would reduce the NOE intensities by a factor of 10. Because the intensities of the observed NOEs to water within the cavity are among the highest observed and are of an intensity comparable to that involving structural waters that are detectable by crystallography at high occupancy (Fig. 1), a situation in which the cavity would be empty in a major (-90%) species, but filled in a minor (-10%) one (perhaps an open form that permitted rapid exchange with solvent) is unlikely. Consequently, the bound water within the hydrophobic cavity observed by NMR is in all likelihood positionally disordered and present at high occupancy (near unity). Such positional disorder, coupled with the presence of several water molecules within the cavity, would not attenuate the NOE cross-peaks (4, 5) but would make them invisible crystallographically (2). It is perhaps worth noting that if only a single water molecule were present in the cavity, positional disorder would result in some attenuation of the
cross-peaks owing to (r-6)-116 averaging
(where r is distance).

The central cavity can communicate to
the exterior via two small channels. One is
located at the opening of the 13 barrel (front of Fig. 3A) and has dimensions of 1.9 A by 0.4 A in cross section; the other is located at the back of the P13 barrel (front of Fig. 3B) and has dimensions of 1.7 A by 1.6 A in cross section. Although both channels are too narrow to permit the penetration of water molecules, one would expect them to open transiently during fluctuations that are known to occur, as evidenced by rapid aromatic ring flipping. As the NOEs are
observed at the resonance of bulk water,
one can conclude that the water molecules
in the cavity are in fast exchange with
solvent water on the time scale of the
chemical shift. This, together with the observation of sizable negative NOEs (Fig. 1),
indicates that these water molecules are
long-lived, with a residency time ranging from a lower limit of 1 to 2 ns to an upper
limit of 100 to 200 pzs.
Can it be energetically favorable for water to occupy a cavity that is surrounded by nonpolar residues? Upon transferring a small molecule with a large dipole [IJx - 0.4 eA for water (21)] from the solvent to the cavity, the most significant change in free energy probably arises from less favorable electrostatic interactions with the nonpolar envi-
ronment. To estimate this increase in free
energy for a water molecule, we modeled the water molecule as a spherical region (with
radius a and dielectric constant ew) that
carries a dipole pU at its center and is embedded in the surrounding medium (with di-
electric constant em). In such a model, the electrostatic interaction energy of the dipole with the surrounding medium is (22)
-332(£, - £w)wJ/(2£, + £ew)e£,a3 (1) Taking ew to be 2 (22) and a to be 1.4 A,
this formula gives values of -4.7 and -2.0
kcal mol-~', respectively, for the electrostat-
ic interaction energy of the dipole of the water molecule with the bulk solvent (em = 78.5) and with the nonpolar environment of the cavity [assuming Em = 4 for the protein (23)]. Thus, it costs about 2.7 kcal
mol-~' to transfer a water molecule from the
solvent to the cavity. The water molecule, however, may be
stabilized by favorable interactions with the charges of the protein. To see if such stabi-
lization occurs, we calculated the electro-
static potential generated by the protein charges in the cavity. In this calculation, the protein is modeled as a low dielectric region embedded in a high dielectric solvent (23, 24) (Fig. 3). The electrostatic potential at the two ends of the cavity is opposite in sign and thus indeed stabilizes the dipole of a water molecule. The potential, however, would have been negative in the entire cavity if the high dielectric sol-
1816

vent had not been taken into consideration.

Thus, the sign reversal at one end of the

cavity arises from polarization charges on

the dielectric boundary between the protein

and the solvent. The electrostatic field E in

m4akncaylrmeogilo-n1s

oef-1thAe~-c1.aviTthyisis

between 2 lowers the

and free

energy of a water molecule (ELi) by 1 to 2
kcal mol-1 and offsets a substantial portion

of the cost of transferring the molecule from

the solvent to the cavity. (It should be

noted that sign reversal of the electrostatic

potential per se is not a requirement for

stabilization of a dipole, as all that is needed

is a gradient of the potential.)

Several other factors may further stabi-

lize the water within the hydrophobic cav-

ity. First, a water molecule may form weak

hydrogen bonds with the aromatic rings (25) of Phe42, Phe112, and Phe146, which

line the cavity. Although these hydrogen

bonds are electrostatic in nature, their con-

tribution to the stabilization of water within

the cavity may be underestimated in the

electrostatic calculation presented above.

Second, the interaction energy of a water

molecule with the surrounding medium

may be decomposed into electrostatic and

nonelectrostatic components. Our calcula-

tion shows that the electrostatic compo-

nent (arising from the dipole of the water

molecule) may somewhat favor the solvent.

The dominant portion of the nonelectro-

static component is the entropic contribu-

tion arising from the rearrangement of mol-

ecules around the solute (that is, the water

molecule under consideration, which may

be modeled as a spherical region without

the dipole when dealing with nonelectro-

static effects). The difference in entropic

contribution between the solvent and the

nonpolar environment of the cavity is just

the effect of hydrophobic interactions and

can be estimated from the free energies of

transferring nonpolar groups from water to

organic solvents. When the surface area of a

water molecule (-35 A2) is multiplied by

the proportionality constant between trans-

fer free energy and surface area [0.025 kcal mol-' A- (26)], we find that the nonelec-

trostatic component favors the cavity by ---0.9 kcal mol1-. Third, if more than one

water molecule occupies the cavity, hydro-

gen bonding between these molecules will

be strengthened in the low dielectric cav-

ity (27). This will compensate for any loss of entropy that is a result of the confine-

ment within the cavity. Such loss of entropy should be small, as suggested by the

fact that the cavity water is positionally

disordered. Finally, occupation of a poten-

tial vacuum at the center of the protein

increases the entropy of the protein-sol-

vent system.
In the light of these arguments, it there-

fore seems likely that the presence of posi-

tionally disordered water within an internal, moderately sized hydrophobic cavity is energetically more favorable than its absence. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the central hydrophobic cavity is con-
served in all other members of the 13-trefoil
class of proteins (12), for which complete coordinates have been deposited in the
Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. These in-
clude mouse IL-13, basic and acidic fibroblast growth factor, and the Kunitz inhibitor from Erythrina cafra (28). In the case of mouse IL-i3 the size of the cavity is the same as that of hIL-l1B, whereas for the other three proteins it is approximately half that size. This observation suggests that the central hydrophobic cavity is a common feature of the p3-trefoil class of proteins,
which arises as a result of the limited nature of the available amino acid side chains to fill
the space generated by the fold. Just as in the crystal structures of hIL-113, the cavity appears empty in the crystal structures of these four proteins, indicating that any water present is positionally disordered. As the stabilizing forces discussed above are not unique to hIL-113, we suspect that the occurrence of positionally disordered water in large hydrophobic cavities is a common phenomenon and that some of the crystallographically empty hydrophobic cavities generated in a variety of mutants ofT4 lysozyme (8) and ribonuclease A (9) may also be filled with positionally disordered water.

15. All NMR experiments were carried out on a 1.7 mM sample of uniformly labeled (>95%) 13C-15N hlL-1 13, at pH 5.4 in 150 mM sodium acetate-cl3 buffer dissolved in 90% HO20-10% D2O. The sample of hlL-1 P was expressed, labeled, and purified as described (13). The spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance self-shielded z gradient probe. The 2D HO20 NOE-ROE-1H-13C HSQC experiments were carried out exactly as described in (17) with the use of the water flip-back technique to avoid saturating the water (16). The NOE spectra were recorded with mixing
times of 60,100, and 200 ms at 35°C and 60 ms at

20°C, whereas the ROE spectra were recorded at
mixing times of 30 ms at both 20° and 35°C. In addition, a control H20-NOE-1H-13C HSQC spectrum with a mixing time of 100 ms was recorded with weak presaturation of the water resonance followed by a 200-ms delay before the first selective 1H pulse (17) [S. Grzesieketal.,J. Am. Chem. Sec. 116,1581 (1994)]. In this control spectrum, all interactions with

water were attenuated (about 20-fold), whereas
NOEs to protons attached to 12C, which resonate in the vicinity of the water resonance, were essentially unaffected. All the cross-peaks observed in the H20NOE1-H-13C HSQC difference spectra were sup-

pressed in the control difference spectrum, which indicates that they arise solely from interactions with water (either direct or indirect by means of an exchangeable proton). By recording NOE spectra at several mixing times, as well as ROE spectra, we

could ascertain that the cross-peaks attributable to NOEs with water were not the result of spin-diffusion. The spectra were processed with NmrPipe [F. Delaglio et al., in Proceedings of the 35th Experimental Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Conference (Asilomar, CA, abstract WP108, 1994), p. 262] and were displayed and analyzed with the programs CAPP and PIPP [D. S. Garrett, R. Powers, A. M. Gronenborn, G. M. Clore, J. Magn. Reson. 95, 214 (1991)]. The spectral assignments were taken from G. M. Clore, A. Bax, P. C. Driscoll, P. T. Wingfield, and A. M.

where ES and Em are the dielectric constants of the

water molecule and surrounding medium, respectively, and a is the radius of a water molecule. The electrostatic interaction energy of the dipole with the

thus chose s, = 2. The change in the interaction free

energy of a water molecule with surrounding water

molecules from the vapor phase to the liquid phase has been estimated from the vapor pressure and density of water and is found to be -6.3 kcal mol-1 at 25°C [A. Ben-Naim and Y. Marcus, J. Chem. Phys. 81, 2016 (1984)]. This is very close to the value
(-7.1 kcal mol-1) predicted by our simple model for
the change in electrostatic interaction energy. The

model gives +2.4 and -4.7 kcal mol-~1, respectively, for the electrostatic interaction energy in the vapor
phase (Sm = 1) and in the liquid phase (em = 78.5). A small (that is, <1 kcal mol-~1) nonelectrostatic component that disfavors the liquid phase would further improve the agreement between the model prediction and the estimate from experimental data. 23.

DNA Topoisomerase and Recombinase Activities
in Nae I Restriction Endonuclease
Kiwon Jo and Michael D. Topal*
Nae I endonuclease must bind to two DNA sequences for cleavage. Examination of the amino acid sequence of Nae I uncovered similarity to the active site of human DNA ligase I, except for leucine 43 in Nae instead of the lysine essential for ligase activity. Changing leucine 43 to lysine 43 (L43K) changed Nae I activity: Nae I-L43K relaxed supercoiled DNA to yield DNA topoisomers and recombined DNA to give dimeric molecules. Interruption of the reactions of Nae I and Nae I-L43K with DNA demonstrated transient protein-DNA covalent complexes. These findings imply coupled endonuclease and ligase domains and link Nae endonuclease to the topoisomerase and recombinase protein families.

Topoisomerases, recombinases, and endo-
nucleases share the ability to cleave DNA but do not have sequence homology. Topoisomerases catalyze DNA relaxation by cleavage, strand passage, and reunion; recombinases catalyze DNA rearrangements by concerted cleavage and exchange of DNA ends; and endonucleases catalyze cleavage of single- and double-stranded DNA. These enzymes are ubiquitous and essential for replication, transcription, recombination, and repair of DNA (I). Although there has been speculation on their evolution, no relation among these enzymes
has been found. Endonucleases include as a
special class the restriction enzymes, which in bacteria protect against foreign DNA. The restriction enzymes, along with the site-specific recombinases, offer examples of sequence-specific DNA cleavage. Topoisomerases generally demonstrate sequence preferences but are not sequence-specific.
The placing of restriction enzymes in a separate category from the topoisomerases and recombinases has been called into question by recent discoveries with the type lie

restriction enzymes. It is now clear that the type lie enzymes require the recognition of a second DNA (effector) sequence to cleave DNA; moreover, there is homology between the type lie enzyme Eco RII and the integrase family of proteins (2). These findings indicate complexities in the type lie enzymes beyond that needed for restriction. The type lie enzymes include Nae I (3), Nar I, Bsp MI, Hpa II, Sac II (4), Eco
RII (5), Atu BI, Cfr 91, Sau BMKI, Eco 571,
and Ksp 6321 (6), which represent a wide variety of bacterial species.
Nae I is a prototypical type lie enzyme, a 70-kD dimeric protein (7) with two DNA binding sites, as indicated by its sigmoidal dependence of cleavage velocity on the concentration of recognition sequence (8). The two DNA binding sites of Nae I are nonidentical: one site prefers to bind to GCCGGC with AT-rich flanking sequences, whereas the other prefers to bind to GCCGGC with GC-rich flanking sequences (8). Whether the binding differences preexist or are induced upon occupation of one DNA binding site is unclear. Because Nae I must bind two DNA recognition sequences, a DNA substrate with a single Nae I recognition sequence can resist cleavage (3). This resistance can be overcome by the introduction of another DNA recogni-
