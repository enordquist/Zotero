We perform systematic molecular dynamics simulations of water conﬁned between two nanoscale plates at T = 300 K. We investigate the effect of pressure ͑−0.15 GPaഛ P ഛ 0.2 GPa͒ and plate separation ͑0.4 nmഛ d ഛ 1.6 nm͒ on the phase behavior of water when the plates are either hydrophobic or hydrophilic. When water is conﬁned between hydrophobic plates, capillary evaporation occurs between the plates at low enough P. The threshold value of d at which this transition occurs decreases with P ͑e.g., 1.6 nm at P Ϸ −0.05 GPa, 0.5 nm at P Ϸ 0.1 GPa͒, until, at high P, no capillary evaporation occurs. For d Ϸ 0.6 nm and P ജ 0.1 GPa, the system crystallizes into a bilayer ice. A P-d phase diagram showing the vapor, liquid, and bilayer ice phases is proposed. When water is conﬁned by hydrophilic ͑hydroxylated silica͒ plates, it remains in the liquid phase at all P and d studied. Interestingly, we observe for this case that even at the P at which bulk water cavitates, the conﬁned water remains in the liquid state. We also study systematically the state of hydration at different P for both kinds of plates. For the range of conditions studied here, we ﬁnd that in the presence of hydrophobic plates the effect of P is to enhance water structure and to push water molecules toward the plates. The average orientation of water molecules next to the hydrophobic plates does not change upon pressurization. In contrast, in the presence of hydrophilic plates, water structure is insensitive to P. Hence, our results suggest that upon pressurization, hydrophobic plates behave as “soft” surfaces ͑in the sense of accommodating pressure-dependent changes in water structure͒ while hydrophilic walls behave as “hard” surfaces.

I. INTRODUCTION
Conﬁning geometries that contain thin water ﬁlms are common in biology, geology, and engineering. Examples include ion channels ͓1–6͔, mesoscopic surfactant assemblies ͓7,8͔, mineral inclusions ͓9͔, zeolites ͓10͔, and microﬂuidic technologies ͓11͔. Understanding the changes in water structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics due to interactions with conﬁning surfaces is therefore of interest in a wide variety of scientiﬁc problems and technical applications, such as the inhibition of corrosion ͓12͔, heterogeneous catalysis, the design of superhydrophobic surfaces ͓13͔, the ascent of sap in plants ͓9͔, the function of biological membranes ͓14͔, and the development of “lab on a chip” technologies ͓15͔.
The behavior of water near hydrophobic surfaces has attracted considerable attention, on account of the intrinsic scientiﬁc interest of the thermodynamic problem ͑e.g., ͓16–26͔͒, as well as its relevance to water permeation through membrane channels ͓2–6,27͔ and carbon nanotubes ͓28,29͔, micelle formation ͓20,30͔, and the amphiphaticity of membrane proteins ͓14,31,32͔. Hydrophobic interactions are also important in phase transfer catalysis ͓33͔, chemical selfassembly of macroscopic objects ͓34͔, and capillary evaporation ͓35–37͔.
More than 30 years ago, Stillinger ͓23͔ argued that when a nonpolar solute is sufﬁciently large, the water-solute interface resembles that between water and its own vapor. Lum et al. ͓21͔ proposed a theoretical approach to describe the crossover between the solvation of small and large hydrophobic objects. Bulk thermodynamics and entropic contribu-

tions to the free energy of solvation are dominant in the former case. Interfacial thermodynamics and enthalpic contributions to solvation free energy play a key role in the latter case. The crossover length scale between these two regimes, Ϸ1 nm at ambient conditions, is a sensitive function of pressure and the presence of cosolutes ͓38͔. From a microscopic point of view, this length scale is related to the different manner in which water molecules arrange around solutes of different sizes. In the presence of small hydrophobic solutes, water molecules rearrange in such a way that the solutes can be accommodated into water’s hydrogen-bond ͑HB͒ network. Thus, small hydrophobic solutes are caged in clathratelike structures ͓39–41͔ with HB vectors ͑deﬁned as the four tetrahedral vectors pointing outward from the oxygen atom of each water molecule along the two oxygen-hydrogen bond donor and the two “lone pair electrons” acceptor directions͒ avoiding pointing toward the nonpolar solute. As the solute size increases ͑to Ϸ1 nm at ambient conditions͒ ͓42–45͔, such clathratelike structure cannot be maintained: HB’s break, inducing a restructuring of the HB network. In this case, the hydration structure shows an orientational inversion with respect to the clathratelike structure, with HB’s pointing toward the solute ͓42,43,46–48͔.
When two hydrophobic surfaces approach each other, a conﬁned water ﬁlm can be thermodynamically destabilized with respect to the vapor at small enough separations ͓21,24,35,36,49͔. A plausible interpretation of the experimentally observed long-ranged attractions between hydrophobic surfaces ͑e.g., 10– 100 nm͒ ͓50–53͔ involves dewetting of the interplate region. As shown by Bérard et al. ͓54͔,

such dewetting is not particular to water, but arises as a general consequence of weak ﬂuid-wall interactions relative to ﬂuid-ﬂuid interactions ͓24͔. The generality of conﬁnementinduced drying notwithstanding, interest in this phenomenon has focused predominantly on the case in which the conﬁned ﬂuid is water and the conﬁning surfaces are hydrophobic. Several computational studies of this situation exist ͑e.g., ͓36,44,55–61͔͒.
Kauzmann’s inﬂuential review ͓62͔ ﬁrst pointed out the importance of hydrophobic interactions in protein folding. It is generally accepted that the formation of a core of hydrophobic residues from which water is partially excluded is a dominant force in the folding of globular proteins ͓62–71͔. However, the surface of a protein is a geometrically, chemically, and electrically heterogeneous object, and the distribution, structure, and dynamics of water near such a surface is expected to be quite different from that found near idealized surfaces, such as perfectly hydrophobic walls. In fact, computer simulations have clearly shown a range of water behavior in response to surface heterogeneity. Cheng and Rossky ͓72͔ studied the hydration of the polypeptide melittin. They found that clathratelike structures dominate near convex surface patches, while near ﬂat regions the hydration shell ﬂuctuates between clathratelike and less ordered ͑inverted͒ structures. The collapse of a two-domain BphC enzyme showed no dewetting in the interdomain region when the units were brought together down to a distance of 0.4 nm ͓73͔. A dewetting transition was observed only when electrostatic interactions were turned off ͓73͔. In contrast, dewetting has been observed in the collapse of the melittin tetramer ͓74͔; however, even single mutations were shown to prevent drying.
The above protein folding examples illustrate the importance of understanding water behavior near complex, heterogeneous surfaces. Materials science and engineering applications involving chemically nanopatterned substrates ͑e.g., ͓75͔͒ likewise will require an understanding of water structure near heterogeneous interfaces. Molecular simulations should prove extremely powerful in addressing this problem, because they allow exquisitely sensitive control of surface geometry and chemistry. Questions such as the manner in which the characteristic length of hydrophobic patches and the pattern of their distribution on a hydrophilic surface affect conﬁned water structure and dynamics or the effect of surface chemistry in promoting or preventing bulk cavitation following dewetting of a conﬁned region are ideally suited for computational scrutiny. The recent work of Koishi et al. ͓59͔ is an excellent example of the valuable insights that can be obtained by molecular simulations regarding water behavior near complex surfaces.
This paper is the ﬁrst report of an ongoing computational investigation aimed at understanding the inﬂuence of surface heterogeneity and bulk thermodynamic conditions ͑pressure, temperature͒ on the structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics of conﬁned water. Here we establish the “base case” conditions by comparing water structure and phase behavior at 300 K when conﬁned by purely hydrophobic and purely hydrophilic nanoscale surfaces ͑0.4 nmഛ d ഛ 1.6 nm͒. Li et al. ͓58͔ have recently studied hydration and dewetting near hydrophilic and hydrophobic plates ͑but with different

chemistry than the ones we consider here͒ at a single pressure. An important aspect of the present work is that we perform such a comparison over a broad range of pressures ͑−0.15 GPaഛ P ഛ 0.2 GPa͒. In subsequent papers we will report results on water conﬁned between heterogeneous plates with engineered “patchiness.”
Our computational study should be placed in the context of a considerable body of experimental work aimed at studying systematically the properties of water conﬁned by hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The forces between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solution have been measured with the surface force apparatus ͑e.g., ͓50–53,76͔͒. Such studies revealed the existence of long-range attractions between hydrophobic surfaces, over distances of the order of 100 nm, and investigated the origin of this phenomenon. Bridging cavities and microbubbles were linked in several ͓50,52,53͔, but not all ͓51͔ of these studies, to the longranged attraction. Zhang et al. ͓77͔ investigated the response to shear stresses of water conﬁned between adjoining surfaces, one hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic ͑Janus surface͒. They found that the competing effects of these surfaces gave rise to unusually noisy responses to shear. Jensen et al. ͓55͔ used x-ray reﬂectivity to study the contact region between water and an extended parafﬁn surface. They found that drying was conﬁned to a very narrow ͑Ϸ1.5 nm͒ region. Ruan et al. ͓78͔ investigated the structure and dynamics of water near a hydrophilic surface using ultrafast electron crystallography. They observed coexistence between ordered surface water ͑up to 1 nm thick͒ and crystalline islands. Reference to particular aspects of the studies summarized above will be made throughout this paper, stressing, whenever possible, the relationship between experimental observations and our calculations.
This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the simulation details. The results for hydrophobic plates are presented in Sec. III; calculations on water conﬁned by hydrophilic plates are reported in Sec. IV. We summarize our main conclusions in Sec. V.
II. SIMULATION DETAILS
We perform molecular dynamics ͑MD͒ simulations in the N-P-T ensemble. The system is composed of N = 3375 water molecules in which are inmersed two identical ﬁnite threedimensional nanoscale plates. The temperature is ﬁxed at T = 300 K by using a Berendsen thermostat ͓79͔. The pressure ranges from P = −0.15 GPa to P = 0.2 GPa and is controlled by coupling the system volume to an external bath at P ͑analogous to the Berendsen thermostat ͓79͔͒.
We simulate a cubic sample using periodic boundary conditions along the three directions. Water molecules are modeled with the extended simple-point-charge ͑SPC/E͒ pair potential ͓80͔. The plates are introduced symmetrically about the center of the box such that they are parallel to the x-y plane and equidistant from the z = 0 plane. The plate dimensions ͑3.215ϫ 3.217ϫ 0.866 nm3͒ are smaller than the box size ͑which varies with P but always exceeds 4.85 nm under the conditions investigated here͒. Figures 1͑a͒ and 1͑b͒ show a fully hydroxylated silica plate ͑one of the two kinds of

We consider two kinds of plates: hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Their common underlying structure corresponds to four layers of SiO2 ͓see Fig. 1͑b͔͒ reproducing the ͑1.1.1͒ octahedral face of cristobalite ͓81,82͔ ͓see Fig. 1͑a͔͒. The unit cell of SiO2 is idealized as a perfect tetrahedron with O-O and Si-O distances of 0.247 nm and 0.151 nm, respec-
tively. The hydrophobic plates consist of the above-described
structure; however, the “Si” and “O” atoms interact with wa-
ter molecule O atoms exclusively via a Lennard-Jones potential ͑⑀ and ␴ parameters are given in Table I͒. Each hydrophobic plate is composed of 674 atoms.
The hydrophilic plates correspond to fully hydroxylated
silica and are obtained by attaching a hydrogen atom to each surface oxygen atom on the four plate surfaces ͓see Figs. 1͑d͒ and 1͑e͔͒. The O-H distance is chosen to be the same as

in the SPC/E model—i.e., 0.1 nm. The Si and O atoms are located in ﬁxed positions ͑as in the hydrophobic plates͒ but the H atoms on the surface are able to move with ﬁxed bond lengths and bond angles; each H atom can reorient in a circle. Such circular motion occurs in a plane parallel to the plate at a distance 0.033 nm away from the O-atom plane of

the Si-O-H groups. The resulting Si-O-H angle is 109.27° ͓see Fig. 1͑e͔͒. Each hydrophilic plate is composed of 778 atoms. Only the polar Si-O-H groups at the surface carry partial electric charge ͑charge values are given in Table I͒. Electrostatic interactions are treated using the Ewald sum method with a cutoff distance of 0.79 nm and parameters mmax = 53 ͑for the number of vectors in the reciprocal-space sum͒ and ␣ = 0.4 nm−1 ͑for the width of the screening-charge Gaussian distribution͒ ͓83,84͔.
The vibrations of the Si and O atoms have not been taken into account in this work. A computational study of water in single-wall carbon nanotubes indicates that ﬂexibility can affect a channel’s apparent hydrophobicity ͓29͔. On the other hand, a molecular dynamics study of water droplets on graphite revealed a negligible effect of substrate vibrations on the contact angle ͓85͔. The lattice constant for the cristobalite structure used in this work is 0.494 nm. Invoking a Lindemann-type estimate, the amplitude of individual atomic vibrations should be considerably smaller than the melting threshold ͑10% of the lattice constant͒—i.e., 0.05 nm in our case. This upper bound on the magnitude of substrate atomic vibrations is an order of magnitude smaller than the closest interplate separation considered in our work. Thus, while the effect of crystal vibrations on the structure and dynamics of conﬁned water deserves careful attention and will be explored in future studies, we believe that the present rigid wall base case is a reasonable starting point for our investigations.
The pressure is calculated using the virial expression, taking into account the fact that some atoms in the plates are ﬁxed and others can move ͓84,86͔. We also use the link cell and neighbor list methods to calculate the pair interactions ͓87͔.
We perform simulations for different time intervals depending on the kind of plates and their separation. Simulation times are indicated in Table II. One of the reasons we chose these simulation times is that when there is no capillary evaporation or crystallization, we ﬁnd that quantities such us total energy and volume are constant for t Ͼ 50 ps. Thus, the ﬁrst 50 ps of the simulation are discarded and the rest of the simulation is used for data acquisition. Moreover, the correlation time ͑obtained from the intermediate scattering function͒ in bulk water simulations using the SPC/E model at T = 300 K and ␳ = 1.0 g / cm3 is approximately 3 ps ͓88͔. Thus, our simulations appear long enough to avoid effects of the equilibration process on our calculations.

FIG. 2. ͑Color online͒ Phase behavior of conﬁned water as a function of pressure and separation between nanoscale hydrophobic plates. The temperature is ﬁxed at T = 300 K. Solid circles indicate liquid-state points. Open squares indicate vapor-state points at which capillary evaporation occurs ͑i.e., we observe no water molecule between plates͒. For d Ϸ 0.6 nm, a bilayer crystal is formed as indicated by red ϫ symbols. At d = 0.6 nm and P = 0.05 GPa, ﬂuctuations between liquid and vapor states are observed for at least 1 ns. Solid lines suggest a schematic phase diagram based on the simulation results. In the ﬁgure, the dashed red line corresponds to the assumption that the crystal region is not connected with the liquid-vapor transition line—i.e., that there is no “triple point” between the liquid, the vapor, and the bilayer crystal. The black dotted line is the extrapolation of the liquid-vapor transition line into the d ഛ 0.4 nm region, where no liquid can be simulated due to the small distance between plates.

III. RESULTS: HYDROPHOBIC PLATES

A. Capillary evaporation: Effect of pressure

In this section, we describe the effects of pressure P and plate-plate separation d on the phase behavior of water con-
ﬁned between hydrophobic plates at T = 300 K. To consis-
tently deﬁne d, we use the distance between the planes containing the hydrogen ͑H͒ atoms on the inner surfaces of two hydrophilic plates. In the case of hydrophobic plates, where no hydrogen atoms are present, the same planes ͑where the H atoms would hypothetically be located͒ are used to deﬁne d. As previously noted, the plane containing the H atoms is
located at a distance 0.033 nm from the plane containing the
oxygen atoms of the silanol groups.
Figure 2 summarizes the results of our MD simulations for d ജ 0.5 nm. Two observations are most relevant from Fig. 2: ͑i͒ the threshold separation distance dth required for capillary evaporation decreases with increasing P, and ͑ii͒ for d Ϸ 0.6 nm a bilayer crystal is obtained at high P. Simulations for d ഛ 0.4 nm at P = 0.2 GPa and 0 GPa show that molecules are trapped interstitially between the plate atoms.
The water molecules remain in a plane and are not able to
diffuse due to the lack of space between plates.
The decrease in dth with increasing P can be understood as follows. Equating the grand potential of the conﬁned liq-
uid and the conﬁned vapor, for sufﬁciently large surfaces ͓35,50͔,

from Eq. ͑2͒ that dth decreases with increasing P, as manifest in Fig. 2. For an incompressible liquid, P − P* = ␳l͑␮l − ␮v͒, and, therefore ͓21,35͔,

where ␮l and ␮v denote the chemical potentials of the liquid at P and of the vapor ͑and liquid͒ at P*. In the above derivation we have assumed that the plate characteristic size ϷA1/2 is large enough so that one can neglect the ﬁnite lateral size of the conﬁned region ͑i.e., dth / A1/2 Ӷ 1͒ ͓35͔.
A sequence of snapshots showing a typical dewetting process is given in Fig. 3. We observe that the density rapidly becomes rariﬁed on a time scale of Ϸ10 ps, and then the solvent retreats on a somewhat longer time scale ͑Ϸ100 ps͒.
The capillary evaporation observed in our simulations does not show signs of the intermittent wetting and dewetting that is seen in hydrophobic cylindrical pores ͑e.g., ͓2͔͒ and is characteristic of systems very close to the critical separation for the transition. At P = 0 GPa and d ഛ 0.6 nm, the vapor cavity is limited to the area of the plates; i.e., the water surrounding the plates remains in the liquid state ͓Fig. 3͑d͔͒. However, at the lower pressure P = −0.05 GPa and d ഛ 1.2 nm, the bubble originally formed between the plates expands to the bulk liquid, inducing cavitation of the whole system. In other words, a heterogeneous nucleation event occurs induced by the plates. For P ഛ −0.1 GPa and d ഛ 1.6 nm, we observe a simultaneous cavitation inside and outside of the conﬁned space, indicating that, for the present water model, the liquid phase is unstable for P ഛ −0.1 GPa. We note that when capillary evaporation occurs, no water molecule is observed between the plates. Thus, practically speaking, what we call “vapor phase” is here a vacuum.
Observations consistent with this picture have been reported in measurements of the force between hydrophobically coated mica surfaces immersed in water ͓53͔. Speciﬁcally, vapor cavities formed spontaneously when mica surfaces coated with a double-chain cationic ﬂuorocarbon surfactant approached distances between 1 and 4 nm ͓53͔. However, cavities only formed after separation from contact when the mica surfaces were coated with a double-chain cationic hydrocarbon surfactant ͓53͔. Both the separation at which cavities formed and the magnitude of the force between the hydrophobic surfaces were found to be very sensitive to the speciﬁc substance used to coat the mica surface ͓52,53͔. The range and strength of the perturbation of the water density by our hydrophobic surfaces is consistent with the observed weak dewetting and measured interfacial widths at an extended parafﬁn surface ͓55͔.
Our results on capillary evaporation are in agreement with previous grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo simulations

of water using the SPC model ͓89͔. That work shows that capillary evaporation between smooth planar hydrophobic walls occurs at walls separations D Ϸ 1.27 nm and D Ϸ 0.9 nm at P = 0 GPa and P Ϸ 0.1 GPa, respectively. These distances correspond, in our case, roughly to d Ϸ 0.79 nm and d Ϸ 0.42 nm ͑see Fig. 2͒.
The presence of a crystal at high P has not been discussed so far in the context of capillary evaporation. However, there is considerable evidence from MD simulations showing that conﬁned water may crystallize at high P ͑see, e.g., ͓90͔͒. Koga et al. found crystallization in MD simulations of the four-point transferable intermolecular potential ͑TIP4P͒ at T Ϸ 230– 300 K and P = 0.5– 1.0 GPa ͓91–93͔.

To conﬁrm that conﬁned water crystallizes at high P and d Ϸ 0.6 nm, we calculate the mean-square displacement ͑MSD͒ parallel to the plates at P = 0.2 GPa for different values of d. Figure 5͑a͒ shows the MSD for a 400-ps simulation averaging over molecules ͑we do not average over starting times͒. For d = 0.4 nm, we ﬁnd that ͑MSD͒ Ϸ0, consistent with the earlier observation that molecules are trapped be-
tween the plate atoms. For d = 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 nm the MSD
increases monotonically with time and, for a ﬁxed time, with
d. However, the MSD for d = 0.6 nm shows a fast increase for t Շ 50 ps and then approaches an asymptotic value of Ϸ0.2 nm. Snapshots of the system during the ﬁrst 50 ps show that the molecules in the conﬁned space reorganize to form the crystal. For 50 psՇ t Շ 300 ps, the resulting ice shows defects that disappear with time. The transformation is almost over for t Ϸ 300 ps. In the absence of crystallization, one would expect the MSD at long times for d = 0.6 nm to
fall between that corresponding to d = 0.5 nm and d
= 0.8 nm. Instead, the MSD curve for d = 0.6 nm shows a
plateau, as for d = 0.4 nm, after about 250 ps, consistent with
the view that the system crystallizes.
The crystallization of conﬁned water is also conﬁrmed by
structural properties such as the radial distribution function ͑RDF͒ parallel to the plates, gxy͑r͒, and the probability density function to ﬁnd a molecule located at z between the plates, Pn͑z͒. Figure 5͑b͒ shows gxy͑r͒ for the ice ͑d = 0.6 nm͒ and for a bilayer liquid ͑d = 0.8 nm͒. The oscillations in gxy͑r͒ for d = 0.6 nm are a clear sign of crystallization. Such oscillations are not present in the liquid phase. We note that the slow decay of gxy͑r͒ for large r is due to the ﬁnite size of the plates. This ﬁnite-size effect can be removed by taking the ratio of gxy͑r͒ for the crystal to that of the liquid ͑see inset͒. The persistence of oscillations is then clear. Figure 5͑c͒ shows the Pn͑z͒ for the ice ͑d = 0.6 nm͒ and for a

Such substrate-templated crystallization of interfacial water has been observed on hydrophilic surfaces ͓78͔. Figure 6͑a͒ is a schematic diagram showing both hexagons formed by the water oxygen atoms and the atoms at the plate surface. The atoms at the plate surface are arranged in tetrahedra pointing either into or out of the page of the ﬁgure. These two kinds of tetrahedra alternate, forming rings composed of six tetrahedra ͓see also Fig. 1͑a͔͒. Two rules determine the structure of a given hexagon of the ice layers: ͑i͒ a water oxygen atom is located on top of each tetrahedron pointing into the page of the ﬁgure, and ͑ii͒ a water oxygen atom is located on top of the center of the hexagonal rings formed by the tetrahedra at the plate surface. As a result, the ice layers are formed by perfect hexagons with an OO distance of 0.29 nm. Interestingly, this is the same distance separating the two ice layers ͓see Fig. 5͑c͔͒. Thus, the OO distances between nearest and next-nearest neighbors are 0.29 nm and
ͱ3 ϫ 0.29 nm= 0.49 nm, respectively. These values are in
agreement with the location of the ﬁrst two maxima of gxy͑r͒ ͓see Fig. 5͑b͔͒ which are located at Ϸ0.29 nm and Ϸ0.51 nm, respectively.
The bilayer ice is fully hydrogen bonded, and each mol-
ecule has four HB’s, as in ordinary ice. HB’s occur either
between molecules in the same ice layer or between both layers ͑i.e., there are no HB pointing toward the plates͒. The two water layers are linked by HB’s where a molecule of one
layer shares one of its H atoms with the nearest oxygen atom of the other layer ͓see Figs. 6͑b͒ and 6͑c͔͒. We note that the HOH angle in the SPC/E model is 109.47°—i.e., the tetra-
hedral angle. However, in the bilayer ice structure, the OOO angles ͑formed between three nearest neighbors͒ are either 90° or 120°. Therefore, in general, the OO directions ͑between nearest neighbors͒ differ slightly from the OH directions of a given water molecule.
In Refs. ͓101,102͔, it was found that TIP4P water within carbon nanotubes can crystallize, forming a tube of square,
pentagonal, or hexagonal ice, depending on the nanotube ra-
dius. The structure of the carbon nanotube hexagonal ice
seems to be the same as that found in the present work. Interestingly, the same requirements ͓that the conﬁnement geometry allows ͑i͒ next-nearest oxygen atoms to be located roughly at the bulk O-O distance ͑Ϸ0.28 nm͒ ͓102͔ and ͑ii͒ water molecules to have four hydrogen bonds͔ are necessary for ice formation in our case and in the carbon nanotubes.
Simulations of water between crystalline inﬁnite walls using the TIP5P model ͓90,103,104͔ and between smooth inﬁnite walls using the TIP5P ͓105͔ and TIP4P models ͓92͔ also show the formation of crystals at T = 300 K. Both monolayer and trilayer ices have been reported ͓104,105͔. As indicated in Fig. 2, our simulations at P = 0.2 GPa show no sign of
monolayer ice at small d nor of crystallization to other solids at larger d ͑corresponding to n-layer crystals, n ജ 3͒. Small variations in d ͑Շ0.1 nm͒ were found to have a profound
effect on the appearance and disappearance of conﬁned ices ͓92,103,104͔. In Fig. 2, the values of d simulated at a given P are separated by ⌬d ജ 0.1 nm. Thus, it is possible ͑but unlikely͒ that these ices can be found for conﬁned SPC/E at T Ϸ 300 K when using a smaller ⌬d.

Circles correspond to the values of ␳͑P͒ for bulk water taken from Ref. ͓88͔. For conﬁned water, we show two estimates of ␳͑P͒ corresponding to different deﬁnitions of the conﬁned volume. Squares and triangles correspond to ␳͑P͒ calculations when using the “effective” and “formal” deﬁnition of volume, respectively ͑see Sec. III B for details͒.

Figure 2 also shows a schematic conﬁned phase diagram superimposed on the simulation data points. The bilayer crystal and liquid phases are indicated, together with an estimate of the dewetting transition line. At T = 300 K, we ﬁnd that the dewetting transition line extends down to d = 0.5 nm, suggesting that it merges with the region ͑deﬁned by d Շ 0.4 nm͒ for which molecules get trapped between the plate atoms. It is interesting to consider whether for a higher T the dewetting transition line might end in a critical point. The relationship between the dewetting locus and water’s ordinary vapor-liquid critical point will be investigated in future studies at higher temperatures. It is also possible that the bilayer crystal region in Fig. 2 expands down to the dewetting transition line ͑see red dotted line in the ﬁgure͒. In this case, there would be a triple point where the vapor phase coexists with the liquid and crystal phases. Our simulation at P = 0.05 GPa and d = 0.6 nm does not show the presence of a crystalline structure. Instead, we observe a competition between a disordered ͑liquid͒ structure and bubble formation. At 600 ps a bubble occupies 25% of the conﬁned space, and at 1 ns we ﬁnd that 90% of the conﬁned space is dewetted. With the size of the plate area that we simulate, it is not possible to observe simultaneously the vapor, liquid, and crystal phases ͓only approximately ﬁve hexagons per side can be clearly observed in Fig. 4͑a͔͒. A precise investigation of the existence ͑or lack thereof͒ of a triple point requires larger plate surface areas than we have used in this work.
B. Water structure: Effect of pressure
To study the effects of pressure on the structure of water we ﬁx d = 1.6 nm. This separation is large enough so that water properties in the middle region between the plates are essentially those of bulk water ͓46͔.
Figure 7 shows the average water density between the plates at each pressure, ␳͑P͒. For comparison, we show also the density of bulk water reported in ͓88͔. We deﬁne ␳͑P͒ = ͗n͑t͒͘ ϫ mH2O / Vconf where mH2O is the mass of a water

molecule and ͗n͑t͒͘ is the average number of molecules in
the conﬁned space between the walls. When dealing with conﬁned systems, deﬁning the accessible volume for the conﬁned liquid is not unique. We estimate Vconf in two ways: by the formal dimensions of the conﬁned space, based on the deﬁned d—i.e., Vconf = 1.6ϫ 3.217ϫ 3.215 nm3—and by an effective available volume Vconf = def f ϫ 3.217ϫ 3.215 nm3 where deff is an effective plate-plate distance. If Pn͑z͒ is the probability density to ﬁnd an O atom in a slab parallel to the plates located at z (͐Pn͑z͒dz = 1), then deff is deﬁned such that Pn͑±deff / 2͒ = 0.5 ͓see Fig. 8͑a͔͒. The ﬁrst approach to the calculation of Vconf underestimates ␳͑P͒ because the formal conﬁned volume extends practically to the plate surface ͑i.e., the plane where the H atoms would be located͒ and thus includes space not accessible in practice to water molecules. The second ͑effective͒ deﬁnition of Vconf overestimates ␳͑P͒ because it leaves out from the calculation a portion of volume that is in fact accessible to water molecules.
␳͑P͒ in the conﬁned space is always smaller than the bulk density for P Շ 0.06 GPa, independently of the method used

to calculate Vconf. For P Ͼ 0.06 GPa the two estimates of Vconf produce drastically different results. One expects that at high P the water density in the conﬁned space approaches
that of the bulk water. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the
formal deﬁnition of Vconf, using the d value deﬁned a priori, leads to a more reasonable high-P trend. For all cases, one ﬁnds that the slope of ␳͑P͒ is always greater than that of bulk
water, indicating greater compressibility between the plates. To conﬁrm this, we interpolate ␳͑P͒ in Fig. 7 with a second-
order polynomial and calculate the corresponding derivative
with respect to P. The resulting values for the compressibility, ␬T, at P = 0 GPa and T = 300 K, are ␬T ϳ 0.47 GPa−1 for bulk water and ␬T ϳ 1.47 GPa−1 ͑formal volume͒ and ␬T ϳ 1.70 GPa−1 ͑effective volume͒ for conﬁned water. The experimental value of the compressibility at these conditions is ␬T ϳ 0.45 GPa−1 ͓106͔, in good agreement with the simulations.
Figure 8͑a͒ shows the density proﬁle ␳slab͑z͒—i.e., the local density in a slab parallel to the plates, located at z. It
was calculated using 39 slabs of width 0.0411 nm, with an area equal to the plates area. ␳slab͑z͒ resembles the number density at normal T and P reported in Ref. ͓46͔. Figure 8͑a͒ indicates that the main effect of increasing P is to push water
molecules toward the plates. Accordingly, as P increases, ␳slab͑z͒ increases for z Ϸ 0 and the maxima at z ± 0.51 nm for P = −0.05 GPa shift to z ± 0.63 nm at P = 0.2 GPa. Moreover, the maxima and minima of ␳slab͑z͒ are more pronounced at P = 0.2 GPa than at P = −0.05 GPa, as molecules increasingly
sample “harder” plates at high P. We obtain the same con-
clusions when looking at the probability density function for
the H atoms.
To analyze the local packing and hydrogen bonding, we calculate the average coordination number CN͑z͒ and the order parameter q͑z͒ used to characterize the local tetrahedral order in water ͓107,108͔. Averages are taken over slabs of width 0.0411 nm centered at different z. We deﬁne CN͑z͒
as the number of neighbor oxygens within a distance ഛ0.32 nm ͑the ﬁrst minimum of the radial distribution function at ␳ = 0.984 g / cm3 and T = 284 K ͓109͔͒ from a central O atom. q͑z͒ is deﬁned as ͓107͔

where ␺jk is the angle formed by the lines joining the oxygen atom of a given molecule and those of nearest neighbors j and k ͑ഛ4͒. In this work, we also include the oxygen ͑O͒
atoms in the plates when considering the O nearest neighbors j and k.
Figure 8͑b͒ shows CN͑z͒ for different values of P. At all P, we ﬁnd that CN͑z͒ for z Ϸ 0 is close to 4 as is the case for bulk water. The slight increase of CN͑z͒ with P at z = 0 can
be due to the fact that we are using a ﬁxed cutoff of 0.32 nm to calculate the CN ͑while the ﬁrst minimum of the radial distribution function depends slightly on P͒. We observe that CN͑Z͒ decreases as one approaches the plates. However,
right next to the plates we ﬁnd sharp maxima. Moreover, such maxima increase with P as water molecules are

contact with the surfaces lose on average 1.5– 2 water neighbors.
Figure 8͑c͒ shows q͑z͒ for different values of P. At all P, we ﬁnd that q͑z͒ Ϸ 0.62 at z = 0, close to the value 0.60– 0.65 for bulk water at 0.85ഛ ␳ ഛ 1.15 g / cm3 and T = 300 K ͓107͔ ͑indicated in the ﬁgure͒. The peaks of CN͑z͒ next to the plates are accompanied by the rapid decrease of q͑z͒ approaching the interface. At the plates, q͑z͒ Ϸ 0.5, and this
value does not change with P; that is, the local tetrahedrality is not apparently affected by P for molecules in contact with the surfaces.
To study the orientational structure, we follow ͓46͔ and compute the distribution of angles ␪hb between the four HB vectors of water molecules and the inward pointing normal to the plates. Each molecule is associated with four HB vectors: these four vectors point tetrahedrally outwards from the oxygen Lennard-Jones site and such that two of them join the O site to the same molecule’s H atoms. The normalized distribution P͑␪hb͒ in the proximity of the plates is shown in Fig. 9 for different values of P. P͑␪hb͒ shows maxima at ␪hb = 70° and 180°, indicating a preferred orientation for a water molecule with one HB vector pointing toward the nearest plate. These results, and a P͑␪hb͒ calculated in slabs at different distances from the plates ͑not shown͒, are in agreement with the results obtained in Ref. ͓46͔ in constantvolume MD simulations. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that when P increases, despite changes in ␳slab͑z͒, P͑␪hb͒ barely changes, as is evident in Fig. 9. In particular, molecules next to the plates preserve their distinct orientational order under pressure. This is in agreement with the noted invariance of q͑z͒ Ϸ 0.5 next to the surfaces for all P.
The RDF for the water molecule O atom and the O atom at the surface of the plate, gOЈO͑r͒, is shown in Fig. 10. At all P, gOЈO͑r͒ has maxima at 0.32, 0.60, and 0.77 nm. For comparison, the ﬁrst maximum of the bulk water RDF at ␳ = 0.984 g / cm3 and T = 284.5 K ͓109͔ is at 0.28 nm. Thus, water oxygen atoms are located farther from plate surface

oxygen atoms than from other water-molecule oxygen atoms, as expected for hydrophobic surface atoms. The increase of P does not shift the location of the maxima and minima of gOЈO͑r͒, but changes their relative heights. As P increases, more molecules are found in the conﬁned space and, at the same time, more molecules shift from interstitial to coordination shells. Thus, the conﬁned liquid becomes more structured upon compression.
In summary, the effect of pressure on the structure of water conﬁned between hydrophobic plates is to enhance water structure, pushing the water molecules toward the plates. The orientation of water molecules next to the plates is not sensitive to compression, as indicated by Fig. 9.
IV. RESULTS: HYDROPHILIC PLATES
Over the range of conditions investigated here ͑T = 300 K, P = −0.05, 0.05, and 0.2 GPa, and in each case d = 0.6, 1.0, and 1.6 nm͒, we ﬁnd that the conﬁned water remains in the liquid state and shows no sign of capillary evaporation or crystallization. In agreement with the hydrophobic plate simulations, we ﬁnd that for P ഛ −0.1 GPa, the whole system cavitates; i.e., liquid water is unstable. Experimentally, this would manifest itself as a loss of cohesion and the appearance of a macroscopic vapor phase; computationally, it becomes impossible to maintain tensions in excess of 0.1 GPa and the system volume grows uncontrollably due to the appearance of the vapor phase. However, even in this case we ﬁnd no capillary evaporation between hydrophilic plates. In other words, liquid water ﬁlls the conﬁned space, and the hydrophilic plates induce wetting even when there is bulk cavitation around the plates.
Water structure: Effect of pressure
As previously done for the case of the hydrophobic plates, we chose a distance between plates of d = 1.6 nm. The average density in the conﬁned space between hydrophilic plates is shown in Fig. 11. As for the hydrophobic plates case, we deﬁne ␳͑P͒ = ͗n͑t͒͘ ϫ mH2O / Vconf and use both d = 1.6 nm and Pn͑±def f͒ = 0.5 to compute Vconf. In contrast to the hydrophobic case, both methods now lead to very similar ␳͑P͒ values. The underestimated ͑formal volume͒ and overestimated ͑effective volume͒ values of ␳͑P͒ are very close to each other

FIG. 11. ͑Color online͒ Density of water between hydrophilic plates compared to that of bulk water. Symbols and explanation are
the same as in Fig. 7.
and bracket those for bulk water. Interestingly, Fig. 11 shows that the slopes of ␳͑P͒ for conﬁned water ͑using both volume deﬁnitions͒ are almost the same as that of bulk water. This suggests that the compressibility of water conﬁned by hydrophilic plates is the same as that of bulk water. In fact, we calculate the compressibility as in Sec. III B for the case of water conﬁned by hydrophobic plates. We ﬁnd that, using either the formal volume or the effective volume, the compressibility of water conﬁned by hydrophilic plates is ␬T Ϸ 0.52 GPa−1, close to the value ␬T Ϸ 0.47 GPa−1 of bulk water.
Figure 12 shows ␳slab͑z͒, CN͑z͒, and q͑z͒ for water conﬁned between hydrophilic plates at different values of P. The three quantities are insensitive to P over the range of conditions investigated here. Thus, the strong attraction exerted by the walls on liquid water is not measurably perturbed by the additional forces associated with compression. The two maxima of ␳slab͑z͒ in Fig. 12͑a͒ clearly indicate the presence of two water layers next to the plates. We note that Fig. 12͑a͒ is very similar to Fig. 3 of Ref. ͓110͔ for the TIP4P water model. From Figs. 12͑b͒ and 12͑c͒, we ﬁnd that both CN͑z͒ and q͑z͒ in the presence of hydrophilic plates decrease to
zero very sharply at the plate surfaces. Moreover, a comparison of Figs. 8͑c͒ and 12͑c͒ shows that in the absence of the hydroxylated groups on the plates, the values of q͑z͒ start to
decrease at larger distances from the walls than in the case of hydrophilic plates. The resulting proﬁles in Figs. 12͑b͒ and 12͑c͒ are almost ﬂat for the region between the plates, meaning that the values of CN͑z͒ and q͑z͒ next to the plates barely
change with respect to their bulk water values at z = 0. These results suggest that water molecules far from the plates have similar local environment ͑in terms of tetrahedral order and number of nearest neighbors͒ as those next to the plates ͑when including the plate surface oxygen atoms͒. For the molecules next to the plates, the O-H atoms on the plate surface act as “virtual” water molecules, providing extra HB’s to the real water molecules. Again, the slight change in CN͑z͒ at z Ϸ 0 is probably due to the fact that we use a ﬁxed
cutoff when calculating the coordination number. Figure 13 shows P͑␪hb͒ corresponding to a slab next to
the plates of width 0.1 nm. P͑␪hb͒ is in agreement with the corresponding distribution computed in Ref. ͓110͔ for the TIP4P water model and is complementary to the distribution found in the case of hydrophobic plates ͑see Fig. 9͒. The

The RDF’s between the plate oxygen ͑OЈ͒ or hydrogen ͑HЈ͒ atoms and the water molecule oxygen atoms are shown in Fig. 14. These distributions do not change with P, conﬁrming the insensitivity of conﬁned water structure between hydrophilic plates to changes in external pressure. Figure 14 is in agreement with Figs. 11 and 12 of Ref. ͓110͔, which were obtained for the TIP4P water model.
V. SUMMARY
We have presented results from MD simulations of water conﬁned between nanoscale ͑hydrophobic or hydrophilic͒ plates at T = 300 K and for a range of values of pressure P ͑−0.15 GPaഛ P ഛ 0.2 GPa͒ and plate-plate separation d ͑0.4 nmഛ d ഛ 1.6 nm͒.
In the case of hydrophobic plates, a phase diagram in the P-d plane summarizing the MD results is presented, and three phases ͑liquid, vapor, and bilayer ice͒ are identiﬁed. At low P we ﬁnd capillary evaporation. The distance at which this drying occurs decreases with increasing P. Furthermore, the transition line in the P-d phase diagram separating the vapor and liquid phases is followed to small values of d, below which water molecules become individually trapped and immobilized by the surface atoms. It is possible that at higher T, this line ends in a critical point at high d ͑corresponding to the liquid-vapor critical point of bulk water͒.
The bilayer ice is composed of two layers of hexagons in registry along the surface normal. The resulting ice is similar to that found in Ref. ͓91͔. This ice is found at P ജ 0.1 GPa and d Ϸ 0.6 nm, but only in a narrow range of d. The region corresponding to ice in the P-d phase diagram might be connected with the vapor-liquid transition line for larger plates, corresponding to a triple point. However, the plates we simulate are small, and we cannot observe simultaneously the liquid, vapor, and crystal phases. Further investigation is required on this point. We also note that at T = 300 K and in the presence of nanoscale plates, we do not ﬁnd indications of a monolayer ice, like that observed in MD simulations using the TIP4P and TIP5P potentials and inﬁnite walls ͓103͔.
When simulating water conﬁned by hydrophilic ͑hydroxylated silica͒ plates, we ﬁnd that the conﬁned water remains in the liquid phase at all P and d studied. Moreover, even at P

where we observe cavitation in the bulk water, the conﬁned water is in the liquid phase. In other words, the hydrophilic plates induce wetting in the conﬁned space ͑a phenomenon reminiscent of capillary condensation͒. This result suggests that one way to stabilize liquid water under tension may be by hydrophilic conﬁnement. Experiments of water conﬁned between a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic surface ͑Janus interface͒ ͓77͔ suggest a similar physical picture, where the hydrophobic surface encourages water to dewet, while the hydrophilic surface constrains water to be present.
We also study the effect of P on the hydration of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic plates. We focus on the water molecule distribution, average coordination number, and local tetrahedral order parameter along the direction normal to the plates. In the case of hydrophobic plates, all of these quantities indicate that as P increases, water molecules are pushed toward the plates while the liquid becomes more structured. However, the water molecule orientation next to the plates shows no dependence on P. As previously reported in Ref. ͓46͔, molecules have on average one HB pointing to the plate. Strikingly, for the case of hydrophilic plates, we ﬁnd no change in the liquid structure with P in the range −0.1 GPa to 0.2 GPa.
The strong differences observed in the behavior of water conﬁned between hydrophilic and hydrophobic plates leads to the interesting question of what the thermodynamic and structural properties of water are when it is conﬁned between heterogeneous plates ͑e.g., hydrophobic plates that have been partially hydroxylated͒. Results addressing this question will be reported in a subsequent report.

͓86͔ In this work the values of P do not include corrections due to

the cutoff ͑rc = 0.79 nm͒ used when calculating the plate-water, plate-plate, and water-water Lennard-Jones interactions. For

the case of a Lennard-Jones ͑LJ͒ liquid, the correction to P is

given by ͓M. P. Allen and D. J. Tildesley, Computer Simula-

tion of Liquids ͑Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004͔͒

where NLJ is the number of particles. We can estimate ⌬P in

our simulations by using this equation with NLJ = 3375+ 1348

= 4723 ͑i.e., the number of oxygen atoms of the water mol-

ecules plus the number of atoms in the plates that have LJ

interactions͒ and the values of ⑀ and ␴ from the SPC/E model. This gives, ⌬P ͓GPa͔ Ϸ −821/ V2 ͓͑V͔ = nm3͒. Thus, depend-

ing on the volume of our simulations we get −0.063 GPa

Ͻ ⌬P Ͻ −0.047 GPa.

crystal defects occurring during the ice formation ͑approximately t Ͻ 300 ps͒, which causes some diffusing molecules be-
tween the two ice layers during the transient crystallization to
be included in the statistics. Furthermore, there are boundary
contributions due to the ﬁnite size of the plates. Thus, molecules at the boundaries of the plates ͑which do not belong to the crystal͒ might have been included in the statistics. ͓99͔ M.
