ABSTRACT: Integral membrane proteins are ubiquitous in biological cellular and subcellular membranes. Despite their signiﬁcance to cell function, isolation of membrane proteins from their hydrophobic lipid environment and further characterization remains a challenge. To obtain insights into membrane proteins, computational approaches such as docking or self-assembly simulations have been used; however, the promise of these approaches has been limited due to the computational cost. Here we present a new approach called Protein AssociatioN Energy Landscape (PANEL) that provides an extensive and converged data set for all possible conformations of membrane protein associations using a combination of stochastic sampling and equilibration simulations. The PANEL method samples the rotational space around both interacting proteins to obtain the comprehensive interaction energy landscape. We demonstrate the versatility of the PANEL method using two distinct applications: (a) dimerization of claudin-5 tight junction proteins in phospholipid bilayer membrane and (b) dimer and trimer formation of the Outer membrane protein F (OmpF) in the lipopolysaccharide-rich bacterial outer membrane. Both applications required only a fraction of simulation cost compared to self-assembly simulations. The method is robust as it can capture changes in protein−protein conformations caused by point mutations. Moreover, the method is versatile and independent of the molecular resolution (atomistic or coarse grain) or the choice of force ﬁeld employed to compute the pairinteraction energies. The PANEL method is implemented in easy-to-use scripts that are available for download for general use by the scientiﬁc community to characterize any pair of interacting integral membrane proteins.

1. INTRODUCTION
Integral membrane proteins represent a signiﬁcation proportion of the proteome, and they occupy 30−50% of the surface area of a typical mammalian cell membrane.1 They perform vital cellular functions such as signal transduction,2−7 particulate transport,8−14 enzymatic activity,15−17 and cell− cell adhesion,18−27 among others. The membrane proteins employ their hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments to weave through the lipids via single28−32 or multiple membranespanning α-helices33−35 or wrap their β-sheets into barrelshaped structures11,36−38 to stabilize themselves in the lipid bilayer. Additionally, membrane proteins associate with each other through speciﬁc18,39−44 and nonspeciﬁc45−51 interactions mediated by the biochemically complex lipid membrane components.52,53
The clinical signiﬁcance of protein−protein interactions in several disease pathologies has motivated the targeting of such protein contacts for drug design.54−57 However, when interacting proteins are embedded in cell membranes, deciphering their mechanisms of action at the molecular or atomistic levels, essential for rational drug design, has been impeded.58 Experimental isolation and the characterization of membrane proteins’ interactions is often untenable because

their highly hydrophobic nature makes them inherently insoluble.59 To address this challenge, computational methods have emerged to predict protein association using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations at both atomistic and coarse-grained resolutions.60,61
Several protein association studies using molecular dynamics (MD) have been reported, where the proteins are simulated in complex lipid bilayers and solvent environment to mimic the physiological conditions.62−65 A popular MD approach is to simulate large patches (tens of nanometers) of complex lipid bilayers with multiple proteins over extended periods of time (μs).61−69 The protein association behavior is observed by allowing the molecules in the system to self-assemble, most commonly at coarse-grained (CG) resolution using the MARTINI force ﬁeld for biomolecules.70−72 Some notable work using an MD approach includes the study of the dimerization of glycophorin-A (GpA),73 a small protein with single transmembrane (TM) helix; the dimerization of large proteins with multiple TM helix domains such as G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs);63,74 and the claudin family of

tight junction proteins in membrane environments of varying lipid compositions.75−77
Advances in parallel computing workﬂow have enabled
ensemble-based MD approaches that use multiple parallel
systems to retrieve large sets of data. For example, Sidekick
uses a coarse grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation setup to predict the probability of TM−helix insertion into lipid bilayer,78 which is important since the lipid environment signiﬁcantly impacts membrane protein association. Further, this method also quantiﬁes helix interactions based on the
frequency of the amino acid contact matrix obtained from the
ensemble data. Closely related to this approach is the ensemble-based helix−helix interactions approach put forth by Altwaijry et al. speciﬁcally for GPCR interactions,79 which quantiﬁes helix interactions using amino acid contact matrices
generated using distances between them. Another high
throughput method, Docking Assay for Transmembrane components (DAFT),80 focuses on generating multiple unbiased and noninteracting initial conﬁgurations with optimal
periodic boundary conditions and allowing them to self-
assemble over time. Despite rapid advances in ensemble-based investigations of
protein association, the quantiﬁcation of protein−protein association is often based on ﬁnal protein dimer populations,
their interaction distances, or contact mapping. However, such
populations are subject to high degrees of uncertainty as they
are based on the method used to determine convergence. These issues raise the following questionsis the selfassembled protein−protein population in an MD simulation
fully representative of protein association at equilibrium, and at
what time scale in the MD simulation does the population
converge? In this work, our goal was to generate an exhaustive set of protein−protein association conformations and energy proﬁle using a standard set of quantiﬁcation parameters to
overcome the shortcomings of the simulation process outlined
above.

To achieve this goal, we explored the rotational space around both interacting membrane proteins: Protein P1 (0− 360°) and Protein P2 (0−360°). The P1−P2 orientations were generated from multiple initial conﬁgurations with protein dimers within the van der Waals interaction radius. Further, we quantiﬁed the stability of each resulting protein−protein association using their nonbonded interaction energies to generate a potential energy proﬁle for all orientations regardless of their likelihood of formation. Because each orientation is independently and uniformly generated, the need for high energy to overcome barriers in the potential energy landscape is eliminated. The low potential energy conformations for membrane proteins are often unachievable through self-assembly MD simulations due to several factors such as lipid−protein interactions and the masking eﬀect of lipids around the proteins, slow diﬀusion of the proteins in the membrane milieu that tends to dominate in membrane with higher lipid complexity, lack of suﬃcient number of proteins, and adequate simulation length to capture signiﬁcant populations of thermodynamically preferred conformations over kinetically favored conformations. The method discussed in this work allowed us to achieve not only the low potential energy, stable conformations but also explore high potential energy conformations that lack favorable pairwise residue interactions. These attributes render the method, called Protein Association Energy Landscape (PANEL), robust and comprehensive in performing exhaustive sampling of the association space of any given set of proteins or transmembrane entities and make the method independent of the limitations of a speciﬁc force ﬁeld of choice.

The PANEL method captures the pair-interaction energies for an extensive set of transmembrane proteins’ conformations. The goal of the approach is to sample the rotational space around each interacting protein (Figure 1a) and obtain an

extensive data set of possible pair conformations using a
combination of stochastic sampling and equilibration simu-
lations. To accomplish this, we generated a set of initial or seed
geometries {Si:i = 1,...,N} each comprising of a pair of proteins (P1 and P2) randomly oriented in the rotational space (θ,θ′), where θ ∈ {0,360°} and θ′ ∈ {0,360°}. Further, the initial rotational space (θ,θ′) is divided in equal, nonoverlapping segments Ωi, where i = 1, ..., NΩ (Figure 1b). To achieve uniform stochastic distribution of the conformation space, we required the selection of N/NΩ random seed conﬁguration in each Ωi segment.
The proteins were placed within an interacting distance (ds) and embedded in the lipid membrane. Each seed geometry, Si, then underwent a short MD simulation without constraints to
yield a set of equilibrium conformations {Rj: j = 1,...,M}. All N seed conﬁgurations were run independently and in parallel to yield a set of N × M conﬁgurations {Rk; k = 1,...,N × M} (Figure 1c). The nonbonded interaction energy Ej was computed for each equilibrium conformation Rj. The θk and θk′ angles and the corresponding Ek are computed by summing over nonbonded interaction potential energy Vinjb between the P1 and P2 proteins.

The calculation is performed for {Rk; k = 1,...,N × M} conformations that yield the PANEL {θk,θk′,Ek} data set.
For analysis, the PANEL rotational space is binned into Nbin along each of the two θ and θ′ angles to generate a twodimensional (Nbin × Nbin) grid. For each grid, the contour plots for minimum energy and frequency were calculated

where ibin,jbin = 1, 2, ..., Nbin. PANEL Workﬂow. The PANEL workﬂow starts with
coarse graining the atomistic structure of the integral
membrane protein followed by system setup, production, results, and analysis (Figure 2). Each stage of the workﬂow has
been implemented in python scripts (see the Supporting Information), which streamline the information ﬂow from
input to the output. Setup. The coarse grained protein structure(s) were taken
as input to determine the ds value (Figure S1) for the dimer of interest by an in-house python code P_sep.py. Using ds and N as input parameters, seed conformation of proteins embedded
in membrane lipids were generated using P_setup.py script. The SN seed conﬁgurations were generated in a uniformly distributed fashion over the rotational space. The basic framework of the system setup is adapted from DAFT80 with modiﬁcations to include uniform sampling of the initial seed
geometries and inclusion of ds. Each of the N seed geometries was then allowed to undergo energy minimization and
equilibration, followed by production run for M ns. All N
jobs run independently and in parallel for maximum
productivity. Analysis. The trajectories obtained from production runs
were then processed to obtain the dimer angles and interaction
energies as a cascade of steps in the python script, P_analysis.py. Trajectories were ﬁrst treated to remove periodic boundaries to extract the dimer conﬁgurations. The processed
trajectories were then used to obtain the interaction energy between the proteins using GROMACS81−83 utility “gmx

energy”. Next, angles corresponding to each dimer conformation were computed according to rotation angle convention (Figure S2). The data set was ﬁltered to remove conformation frames of dimers that had their center-of-mass distances between them larger than ds. Only the proteins within the ds were used to generate the potential energy landscape.
Binning Data and Energy Landscape Generation. To generate the energy landscape plots, the nonbonded (LJ potential and Columbic) interaction energy of each protein pair (within the ds cutoﬀ) was recorded as a function of the rotational (θ, θ′) angles, and the ﬁnal data set was binned into Nbin and passed to the P_result.py script. The binning was done to divide the rotational space into Nbin number of equally spaced intervals along the x- and y-axes, which represent the degree of rotation of each interacting protein. In the present work, we used Nbin = 360, which resulted in 360 × 360 grid of protein dimer conformations. The entire data set of {θk,θk′,Ek} for {Rk; k = 1,..., N × M} conformations was pooled into the 360 × 360 binned grid. The binned data were sampled to compute (a) frequency, i.e., the number of times each grid point was sampled during the production run; (b) grid coverage to determine the total number of grid points visited; and (c) minimum energy of the conformations at the grid point. Analyzed data are presented as a two-dimensional frequency, grid coverage, and minimum energy contour plots or landscapes.
All in-house python codes written to perform steps from system setup to PANEL analysis utilized several python packages including the MDAnalysis package,84,85 which aided the import and processing of data from GROMACS81 trajectory ﬁles.
Convergence. Multiple PANEL runs were performed to demonstrate convergence for the user-deﬁned input parameters (Figures S3 and S4). To quantify the performance of the PANEL run, we computed the percent coverage of the sampling landscape, deﬁned as

A PANEL simulation with 100% coverage would imply that the entire rotational space (360° × 360°) was sampled at least once. The results of convergence tests (Figure S3) and the recommended input parameters are provided in the Supporting Information (S2).

3. METHODS
The homology-modeled protein structures for our two applications, claudin-5 dimerization and OmpF dimer and trimerization, were obtained using our previously discussed method.75,86 Proteins were CG mapped to the MARTINIv2.272,87 force ﬁeld using martinize.py, and the secondary structure was maintained using Elnedyn bonds with a side chain ﬁx.88 Seed geometries were embedded in the lipid bilayer using insane.py. Claudin-5 systems were simulated in the DOPC (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine) bilayer, and OmpF proteins were embedded in the asymmetric E. coli outer membrane constituted by lipopolysaccharide lipids (LIPO) in the upper leaﬂet and DPPE (dipalmitoylphosphatidylethnaolamine) in the lower leaﬂet. The CG force ﬁeld parameters for LIPO were reported in our earlier work.89 All MD simulations were performed using the GROMACS 2018 package.81 Each system (Table S1) was energy minimized followed by isothermal−isochoric (NVT) and isothermal−isobaric (NPT) simulation steps for 75 ns with position restraints on the protein backbone. Temperature was maintained at 300 K for claudin-5 simulations and at 340 K for OmpF simulations using the v-rescale90 thermostat with τt = 1 ps; a semi-isotropic pressure of 1 bar was maintained using Berendsen barostat91 with a τp = 5 ps during the simulations. For the production MD run, a v-rescale thermostat and a Parrinello−Rahman barostat92 were used with τt = 1 ps and τp = 12 ps. All runs were performed with a 20 fs time step. The nonbonded van der Waals and Coulomb interaction cutoﬀs were set to 1.1 nm. Three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions were applied to each system. The interaction energies between the protein dimers were computed by deﬁning energy groups for each protein in the GROMACS input ﬁle. The point mutations of OmpF were performed using CHARMM-GUI.93,94
4. RESULTS
Two applications are presented to demonstrate the features of the PANEL method and its applicability to diﬀerent integral membrane proteins (Figure 3). The ﬁrst is the association of claudin-5 proteins, critical components of tight junctions at the blood-brain barrier interface.95 The second is the barrel-shaped OmpF that exists as a symmetric trimer in the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane.96,97 The trimer formation illustrates a two-step application of the PANEL method.
Application I: PANEL for Blood-Brain Barrier Tight Junction Forming Claudin-5 Protein Dimer. Claudin-5, a member of the claudin family of tight junction proteins, is a quintessential protein. It establishes the size- and chargeselective barrier at the intercellular space between adjoining endothelial cells that regulates the transport of molecules at the blood-brain barrier interface. This relatively small protein (23 kDa) is composed of 216 amino acids that form four transmembrane domains (TM1-4), two extracellular loops (ECL1 and ECL2), a cytosolic loop (Cyto), and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains (Figure 3a). In previous work, we

have shown that multiple claudin-5 proteins embedded in a membrane interact to form speciﬁc dimeric interfaces, which then self-assemble to form contiguous tight junction strands.75
Here we revisit claudin-5 pair interactions using PANEL primarily to achieve a comprehensive sampling of the pairinteraction energies in the rotational space. In addition to interaction energies, we computed the number of times each grid in the rotational space was visited to produce a frequency landscape. The percent coverage of the rotational space was computed to ensure complete sampling.
Energy Landscape. The PANEL plot for claudin-5 dimer was generated using ∼1.2 million data points (N = 3000 and M = 400). The resulting contour plot (Figure 4a) shows a rugged interaction energy landscape as a function of the rotational coordinates (θ, θ′). The energy values range from −1512.4 kJ mol−1 at (93°, 106°), which is the lowest energy structure to higher energy values up to 0 kJ mol−1. The interaction energy for any conformation is the result of multiple pair interactions between the amino acid residues of the two proteins; this means that a small change in the rotational angle of the proteins can expose new interacting surfaces and residues, to cause a sharp change in the interaction energy. Thus, based on the type of residue−residue contact lost, sharp changes in the PANEL energy landscape are possible. Despite the ruggedness, prominent low energy wells between (100°, 100°) and (120°, 120°) are observed in the claudin-5 energy landscape, which denotes stable and preferred conformations. In contrast, the regions with relatively high energies depict less stable dimer conformations that are energetically less preferred.
The distribution of 1.2 million data points used for generating the energy landscape is shown in the grid coverage plot (Figure 4b). Although the seed geometries (N = 3000) were generated from a uniform distribution, the ﬁnal grid coverage after the MD simulations (M = 400) shows a nonuniform grid coverage. Further, the grid frequency or the number of times each grid was visited was computed as a function of the rotational angles (Figure 4c). Interestingly, the grid frequency mimics the energy landscape; i.e., the visiting frequency is high for grid points that have low energy or preferred conformations, and the visiting frequency is low for grid points associated with high energy and less preferred dimers. Thus, we infer that the interaction energy landscape is in agreement with the grid frequencies.
Grid coverage. The eﬃciency of sampling the rotational space for a pair of proteins was assessed by percent coverage as

data show that for a given value of N, an increase in M results
in incremental increase in coverage. For example, when N = 500, increasing M from 250 to 1500 (corresponds to 1.5 μs of
MD simulation) results in only 61% grid coverage; however, increasing N from 500 to 3000 shows high coverage in 92−
97% range for all values of M.
To illustrate this further, two sets of N and M were compared that have the same number (N × M = 1.5 × 106) of
data points: N = 1000, M = 1500 and N = 3000, M = 500
(Figure 5). In the case of lower N, the population landscape

shows a patchy coverage where MD trajectory was unable to sample the conformations (Figure 5a), whereas in the case of larger N, the MD trajectories are able to sample more conformations. Thus, from this analysis we conclude that sampling a larger set of seed geometries with shorter MD simulations is more eﬃcient in providing higher grid coverage of the rotational space.
Dimer Characterization. In our previous work, we identiﬁed four key claudin-5 dimer orientations (labeled as dimers A, B, C, and D) that were observed with high frequency

in the self-assembly simulations.75 Among these dimers, dimers B, C, and D are symmetric and lie on the symmetry axis (diagonal) of the rotational space, which implies that both the claudin proteins interact via identical domains; for example, to form dimer B, both claudin proteins interact via their TM3 domains, while to form dimer C, both proteins interact through their TM4 domains and the ECL2 loops. Similarly, in the case of dimer D, both the claudin proteins interact via their ECL1 loops. Dimer A, however, lies outside the symmetry axis and the proteins interact via diﬀerent domains; TM4 domain of one protein interacts with the TM1 domain of the other. As shown in our earlier work, symmetric dimers B, C, and D play a signiﬁcant role in the tight junction architecture; both dimers D and B form tight junction pores (Pores I and II).66 In contrast, dimer C functions as the nonpore forming conformation and is vital in the formation of the tight junction seal.
The claudin-5 association results from our self-assembly simulations provide insightful information on tight junction architecture and transport properties of small molecules across the pores; however, the results were often limited by the size of the system (70 × 70 nm2 membrane patch), length of the simulation time (∼10 μs), limited dimer population (15−20 dimers) per simulation, lack of energetics data, and the cost of the simulation (thousands of hours of wall-clock time). The PANEL method mitigates such limitations and provides the interaction energy surface as a function of the rotational space.
The locations of dimers A−D are mapped on the minimum energy contour plot (Figure 6). The dimer C region has low pair-interaction energies (−1512.4 to −1400 kJ mol−1) relative to dimers B and D (−800 to −200 kJ mol−1), which indicates higher stability for these nonpore forming conformations relative to the pore forming dimers. The oﬀ-diagonal regions of dimer A have few low energy conformations, which are less stable than dimer C.
The lowest energy dimer conformation that lies in the dimer C region at (93°, 106°) grid point was reverse mapped to an atomistic level to examine the pairwise residue−residue interactions (Table S2). The vast majority of amino acid residue pairs making signiﬁcant contributions to the stability of the dimer was observed to be from close interaction between TM4 and ECL2 on either of the proteins with additional contribution from TM3 and ECL1. The strongest interacting pair was found to be from the ECLs. Some major interactions include the aromatic residue pair H38−Y148 and the charged residue pair R145−Q159 in the ECL region (Figure S5).

minima. Selected conformations in the local minima were reverse mapped to atomistic resolution to identify the protein− protein contacts in terms of the secondary structure (Figure 7b). Conformations with contacts through the ECL1−ECL1 or Cyto−Cyto domains such as (0°,0°), (340°,340°), or (310°,310°) are less stable than those with some TM−TM contacts (50°,50°), (80°,80°), (110°,110°), (160°,160°), (190°,190°), (240°,240°), and (270°,270°). Notably, the

(110°,110°) conformation, which is a dimer C orientation, forms the largest number of symmetric contacts through ECL1, ECL2, TM3, and TM4 and has the lowest energy. Similar one-dimensional energy proﬁles were generated for other regions of the PANEL contour plot (Figure S6).
Application II: PANEL for the OmpF Dimer and Trimer. The second application demonstrates PANEL method’s versatility to a bacterial proteinOuter Membrane Protein F (OmpF), an integral membrane protein found in Escherichia coli. OmpF porin is a symmetric trimer formed by barrel-shaped monomers, which allow passive exchange of small hydrophilic molecules across the bacterial membrane through their water-ﬁlled channels.11,97,98 Earlier studies have reported that formation of the OmpF trimer occurs via a stepwise process of two monomers forming a dimer intermediate, which then combines with another monomer to form the symmetric trimer.99
The stability of the OmpF trimer is attributed to a set of amino acids (G19, G57, G59, R100, and G135) on the β-barrel surface (Figure 1). In our earlier work, we performed selfassembly simulations of OmpF monomers that formed stable dimers and a symmetric trimer through interaction between monomers via G19 and G135 residues.86 The prohibitively high computational cost of the self-assembly simulations prevented the evaluation of point mutations on dimer and trimer formation and stability. The PANEL method lends itself to such evaluation to better understand the role of key residue in trimer formation.
The PANEL plot for the OmpF dimer was generated using ∼1.5 million data points (N = 3000 and M = 500). The resulting contour plot (Figure 8a) shows a very distinct interaction energy landscape as a function of the rotational coordinates (θ, θ′); both OmpF monomers show preferred orientations around θ or θ′ = 300° or 15°. Thus, there are four

low energy regions below −1400 kJ/mol (∼15°, ∼15°), (∼15°, ∼300°), (∼300°, ∼15°), and (∼300°, ∼300°), as shown in Figure 8b. The reverse mapped structures for representative orientations from the four regions show the conformations involving symmetric G19−G19 or G135−135 interactions between the OmpF monomers or asymmetric G19−G135 interactions.
Interestingly, the lowest energy asymmetric dimer conﬁguration obtained from PANEL corresponds to the precursor for the symmetric trimer formation. The reverse mapped conformation (300°,15°) of the asymmetric dimer shows the signature interaction between G19−G135 residues, with exposed G135 and G19 residues, respectively, to accommodate a third OmpF protein and form a trimer. Symmetric dimers with G19−G19 or G135−G135 interactions are incapable of forming a symmetric trimer.
In addition to G19 and G135, the role of highly conserved glycine residues G57 and G59 and R100 in dimer formation was investigated. In an earlier work, Naveed et al. indicated that each glycine and arginine residue plays a distinct but variable role, and all of them contribute signiﬁcantly to the stability of the OmpF pair interactions. To test the sensitivity of the PANEL method to point mutations and to capture the loss of stability in an interaction, we mimicked the mutations performed in earlier experiments by progressively adding the mutations, starting with the G19W mutation, followed by G19W/G135W/R100L, and ﬁnally with all the key residues mutated as G19W/G135W/R100L/G57I/G59L (Figure S7). The reduced stability of G19W/G135W/R100L/G57I/G59L mutated OmpF is evident in the contour plots (Figure 9).
OmpF Trimer. The PANEL method for generating trimeric systems was designed to have a workﬂow similar to that described for the claudin dimeric system. Here, however, one of the monomers was replaced with a dimer, and the other remained unchanged as a monomer (Figure S2). The most stable dimer orientation (Figure 10a inset) was selected to generate the PANEL for the trimer. To enhance the sampling eﬃciency of the method, selection of the seed geometries was restricted to cyclic orientations where the monomer interacted

with both OmpF subunits of the dimer; noncyclic/linear trimeric seed conﬁgurations were eliminated.
The energy landscape of the OmpF trimer is presented as a polar plot (Figure 10a), where the circumferential angle corresponds to the rotation around the dimer, and the radial angle corresponds to the monomer. The blank spaces correspond to noncyclic conﬁgurations that were eliminated from sampling. Two low energy regions were observed around (∼360°, ∼90°) and (∼360°, ∼270°) showing the interaction of the monomer with OmpF dimer’s major and minor grooves, respectively. The lowest energy trimer was observed around the (∼360°, ∼90°) region on the plot in which the monomer interacts with the exposed G19 and G135 residues. The orientation of the monomer is such that its G19 interacts with

The observed trimer closely matches the OmpF crystal structure, validating the ability of PANEL to capture the energy landscape of the trimeric interactions successfully.
5. DISCUSSION The PANEL method is a robust, computationally inexpensive approach to obtain comprehensive and converged energy landscape data for the association of integral membrane proteins. The method beneﬁts from the proteins’ conﬁnement in the two-dimensional membrane plane as there are fewer degrees of freedom compared to soluble proteins. In both the claudin-5 and OmpF applications, minimal changes to input parameters were required to study a tetraspanning protein in the phospholipid bilayer and a β-barrel porin trimer embedded in a lipopolysaccharide rich bacterial outer membrane.
The PANEL method utilizes a fraction of the computational resources and wall-clock time to complete the simulations as compared to traditional self-assembly simulations (Table S3). The use of much smaller system sizes (10 × 10 nm2 membrane patches) compared to larger self-assembly simulation setups (50 × 50 nm2 membrane patches) and short simulation times (400−500 ns) eliminates the need for high-performance computing resources. Underlying simulation eﬃciency is the use of seed geometries for proteins within the interacting

distance; therefore, short MD simulations provide suﬃcient pairwise energy data for generating the landscape. Additionally, the algorithm supports a high level of parallelization, as each of the selected seed geometries (up to 3000) runs independently. The PANEL workﬂow and scripts are programmed to be userfriendly and easy to install for all future applications.
The PANEL method has several advantages over other computational methods currently in use to analyze membrane protein association. For example in our previous claudin work, the relative stability of the dimers was computed via umbrellasampling or metadynamics simulations that required pull simulations and breaking the dimers into monomers gradually or forming the dimers as a function of some collective variable; neither approach is straightforward for membrane proteins that are embedded in lipids. Similarly, in OmpF trimer selfassembly, the computational cost of the slowly diﬀusing OmpF monomers limited the scope of the work to the wild-type OmpF system. Due to the absence of convergence criteria in self-assembly simulations, it was impossible to prove that the OmpF trimer did not exist when critical glycine residues were mutated. The application of the PANEL method in the present work eliminated the prior limitations.
Comparison of PANEL and the DAFT Method. Developed by Wassenaar et al., the DAFT method80 utilizes a docking strategy plus self-assembly MD simulations to identify preferred protein binding orientations. The novelty of the DAFT method lies in how proteins are placed in unit cells and with optimal periodic boundary conditions that allow maximum decoupling between the protein and its periodic images. The method generates multiple unbiased initial orientations to allow the protein to interact with another protein in the system in any of its periodic images and move in a preferred orientation dictated by the pairwise interactions to form an associated product.
In terms of output, DAFT yields the ﬁnal population of dimers as a function of rotational space. The DAFT output of claudin-5 dimer population was computed using 3000 starting conformations followed by 500 ns of equilibration MD for each system (Figure 11a). The output enables the prediction of preferred dimer orientations based on the population density in a speciﬁc region. However, the DAFT approach (i) does not provide any information on the dimer orientations that are not part of the ﬁnal conformations (in Figure 11a); (ii) may be inﬂuenced by the stickiness of the MARTINI force ﬁeld, i.e., bound proteins are unable to dissociate, despite the eﬀorts to maximally decouple the protein via the periodic images; (iii) relies on slow diﬀusion of proteins to self-assemble, which may

keep dimers trapped in local minima, restricting the uniform sampling of the rotational space; and (iv) requires long simulation times for trimer formation.
On the other hand, the PANEL method builds on the strengths of the DAFT method to provide additional output data (Figure 11b). The key distinction of the PANEL approach is that (i) membrane proteins are placed within the interacting distance (with the van der Waal cutoﬀ) of each other; (ii) sampling of rotational space is done stochastically from a uniform distribution; (iii) interaction energies of the protein dimers are recorded over the equilibration MD run to generate a comprehensive energy landscape; (iv) it provides a fully sampled potential energy landscape as a function of rotational angles; and (v) it achieves convergence by maximizing the grid coverage of the energy landscape. Thus, the PANEL approach builds on the merits of the docking strategy, stochastic sampling, and equilibrium molecular simulations to study protein associations in membrane lipid environment.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We present the computationally aﬀordable, and user-friendly PANEL method for performing comprehensive sampling of association of transmembrane proteins. Unlike other ensemblebased methods of protein association, PANEL does not quantify membrane protein association based on ﬁnal protein dimer populations; and thereby circumvents the limitations associated with the convergence of equilibrium population. The PANEL method can provide a comprehensive set of data for any interacting membrane protein in a highly streamlined parallelized job setup which does not require high-performance supercomputers to generate results and can be achieved with a minimal number of parallel nodes. The method is versatile and independent of the limitations of a speciﬁc force ﬁeld as shown by two example applications of claudin-5 dimer formation and OmpF dimer and trimer formation. Both applications required only a fraction of the simulation cost compared to the selfassembly simulations. The PANEL method successfully captured the loss of stable OmpF dimers upon point mutations that were observed in prior experiments. The PANEL method is implemented in easy-to-use scripts that are available for download and use by the scientiﬁc community to characterize any pair of integral membrane proteins.
