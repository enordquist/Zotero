ABSTRACT: Recovery in K+ channels, that is, the transition from the inactivated nonconductive selectivity ﬁlter conformation toward the
conductive conformation, occurs on a time scale of the order of seconds, which is astonishingly long, given that the structural diﬀerences among the ﬁlter conformations are faint (<1 Å). Computational studies and
electrophysiological measurements suggested that buried water molecules bound behind the selectivity ﬁlter are at the origin of the slowness of recovery in K+ channels. Using a combination of solid-state NMR
spectroscopy (ssNMR) and long molecular dynamics simulations, we
sketch a high-resolution map of the spatial and temporal distribution of water behind the selectivity ﬁlter of a membrane-embedded K+ channel in two diﬀerent gating modes. Our study demonstrates that buried water molecules with long residence times are spread all along the rear of the inactivated ﬁlter, which explains the recovery kinetics. In contrast, the same region of the structure appears to be dewetted when the selectivity ﬁlter is in the
conductive state. Using proton-detected ssNMR on fully protonated channels, we demonstrate the presence of a pathway that allows for the interchange of buried and bulk water, as required for a functional inﬂuence of buried water on recovery and slow
inactivation. Furthermore, we provide direct experimental evidence for the presence of additional ordered water molecules that surround the ﬁlter and that are modulated by the channel’s gating mode.

■ INTRODUCTION
Potassium (K+) channels share a common pore architecture for catalyzing the diﬀusion of ions across membranes.1,2 Ion passage is controlled by two coupled gates.3−6 They are located
at either end of the channel pore and called the activation and
inactivation gates. The inactivation gate is also known as the selectivity ﬁlter. Activation gating is associated with relatively
large hinge-bending and rotational motions of the inner helix
bundle, dilating the pore by about one nanometer upon channel opening.7 In contrast, inactivation gating is accom-
panied by angstrom-scale local structural changes within the selectivity ﬁlter.8−12 Crystal structures of KcsA from Streptomyces lividans obtained at low (3 mM, PDB: 1K4D) and high (200 mM, PDB: 1K4C) K+ concentration [K+]13 are
commonly considered as representative for the closed-
inactivated and closed-conductive channel gating modes, respectively.8,14 According to these conformations, rearrangements within the selectivity ﬁlter upon inactivation are conﬁned to a partial ﬂip of the V76−G77 peptide plane, pinching the ﬁlter shut. The small structural diﬀerences between the conductive and inactivated selectivity ﬁlter, however, stand in
sharp contrast to the remarkably long time scale of seconds on
which recovery from slow inactivation, that is, transition from the inactivated toward the conductive ﬁlter state, occurs. Recent

molecular dynamics (MD) simulations15 showed that this apparent discrepancy could be explained by the dynamics of buried water molecules bound in the back of the inactivated selectivity ﬁlter, which lock the ﬁlter in the inactivated state. MD simulations further predicted that conversion to a dewetted conductive state could only occur upon release of the inactivating water to the bulk, which was indirectly corroborated by the measurement of an accelerated recovery rate at high osmotic stress.
In a broader sense, such buried water molecules can be considered as an inherent part of the channel structure. Nevertheless, many unanswered questions remain regarding the mechanism by which the water modulates the free energy landscape associated with the conformational space of the selectivity ﬁlter, and how the distinct water occupancies are correlated with diﬀerent ﬁlter conformations.16 Previously, we have demonstrated that solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) is a powerful technique to study the structural and dynamical properties of membrane-embedded KcsA variants before and after channel inactivation.6,9,12 Here, we combined ssNMR studies with long MD simulations to provide a high-

resolution spatial and temporal arrangement of buried water in the rear of the conductive and the inactivated ﬁlter of membrane-embedded KcsA, which corroborates that buried water is at the molecular origin of the slowness of recovery. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of high-resolution 1H detected ssNMR on a fully protonated membrane protein to dissect in atomic detail a pathway that allows the interchange of buried and bulk water, as it was suggested to be required for recovery and slow inactivation. Finally, we provide direct experimental evidence for the presence of other sources of

ordered water that surround the ﬁlter and that are modulated by the states of the activation and inactivation gates.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Spatial Distribution of Ordered Water around the
Selectivity Filter before and after Inactivation. In general, ssNMR experiments can report on water proximities by making use of the distinct 1H chemical shift of the water resonance and the fact that polarization transfer schemes such as crosspolarization (CP) or longitudinal mixing report, in the initial

experiments. The mean distances, estimated from MD simulations, are indicated. (b) Same as described in (a) for the closed-inactivated channel

rate regime, on local proton−proton proximities,19 and chemical exchange with bulk water can be neglected.20 For 1H→X transfer, we used short CP times that restrict
polarization transfer to the nearest neighbor (i.e., bonded) X nucleus.19 Thus, 15N edited experiments probe proximities around NH protons, whereas 13C edited experiments are
sensitive to water located close to aliphatic carbons. Note that all amino protons of the selectivity ﬁlter that we use as magnetization receptors in the 15N detected experiments point

directly toward the back of the ﬁlter, while aliphatic protons
may be oriented toward the pore and the lower channel cavity. First, we recorded 2D ssNMR 1H(1H)15N spectra of
membrane-embedded KcsA (see Experimental Section for a
detailed description of the ssNMR setup) before and after channel inactivation. Using 13C and 15N resonance assignments obtained previously,9,12,21 these data provided clear evidence
for higher water occupancy behind the inactivated selectivity ﬁlter (with an open activation gate) in comparison to the

conductive ﬁlter conformation (with a closed activation gate).
In the closed-conductive state (Figure 1a, red), only the upper part of the ﬁlter (G79N) showed an intense correlation with
the water resonance, while such correlations were weak or
entirely absent for residues of the middle and lower parts of the ﬁlter (T78N−T74N). In the open-inactivated state (Figure 1b,
blue), buried water is distributed along the entire rear of the ﬁlter (G79−T75), with the exception of the lowest part of the ﬁlter (T74N) that is right above a large water-ﬁlled cavity. The slightly diﬀerent 1H shifts of water in Figure 1b may indicate
the presence of several water molecules behind the inactivated ﬁlter. Taken together, these ssNMR ﬁndings for the conductive
and inactivated, membrane embedded channel state are hence
in excellent agreement with the spread and content of buried

water molecules in the low [K+] and high [K+] crystal structures,13 respectively (Figure 1c).
To characterize the distribution of buried water around aliphatic protons, we carried out a 3D 1H(1H)13C13C
experiment. For open-inactivated KcsA, this experiment (Figure 1d) revealed clear signals in the 13C−13C plane at the 1H water
resonance for residues Y78, V76, and T75, while T74 was absent. These ﬁndings are in line with our 1H(1H)15N data (Figure 1b) and conﬁrm that buried water is conﬁned to the upper and the middle passages behind the inactivated ﬁlter. Interestingly, 13C−13C cross-peaks of T75, that is located close
to the dewetted residue T74, were more intense than for V76. This is not inferable from the low [K+] crystal structure in
which buried water is closer to V76 than to T75. The apparent

closer proximity in the inactivated ﬁlter conformation of T75 to
ordered water in comparison to V76 observed by our ssNMR data could be conﬁrmed in a series of 2D 1H(1H)13C experiments with varying 1H−1H mixing time (Figure 1e−g).
These results suggest that cross-peak intensities correlate to diﬀerential exposure to ordered water and that they are not modulated by the 13C−13C PARIS spin diﬀusion step. The same set of 13C detected experiments performed on a sample in
the closed-conductive state showed an exposure to ordered water that increased toward the large water-ﬁlled cavity (T75 and T74). Notably, a few protons such as T74Hβ and T75Hβ of the selectivity ﬁlter that are monitored in our 13C detected experiments point toward the selectivity ﬁlter pore and the large water-ﬁlled cavity (vide infra).
These results suggested that the 13C detected experiments are, in addition to water behind the selectivity ﬁlter, sensitive to
the presence of other ordered water molecules. We therefore
calculated the nearest distances of water to the residues that we monitor in 13C detected experiments over long MD simulations for both conductive and inactivated ﬁlter conformations (Figure 2a,b). For the conductive ﬁlter, the simulations clearly showed (Figure 2a) that water behind the ﬁlter is too distant
(>8.0 Å) to transfer magnetization to T75 or T74, raising the question of what causes the high water access in 13C detected
experiments for these two residues. Ordered water within the conductive ﬁlter pore is unlikely, because water has to transverse the ﬁlter within nanoseconds to ensure fast ion ﬂux. We hypothesize that the increased water access stems from
ordered water in the closed large cavity forming a hydration complex to help K+ to overcome the high dielectric barrier of the bilayer and to position K+ optimally to the ﬁlter.13,22 Our
ssNMR data suggest that both T75 and T74 are in proximity of
such ordered cavity water, presumably stabilizing it with their
hydroxyl functions (Figure 2c). Because the inner helix is
supposed to stabilize ordered cavity water and moves outward upon channel opening, dilating the cavity,7 water order is presumably inﬂuenced by the mode of the activation gate and
therefore attenuated in the open cavity. Indeed, in the openinactivated state, residue T74 shows weak water access in 13C
detected experiments (Figure 1d,g). It is interesting to think about a functional role of the close proximity of the ﬁrst or
second ion-hydration layer to the entrance of the selectivity ﬁlter, bearing in mind that Na+ and K+ feature hydration shells in the cavity that are diﬀerent in shape and order and also bind there with diﬀerent aﬃnities.13,23
The computational analysis also conﬁrmed that water behind the inactivated ﬁlter is closer to V76Hα than to T75Hβ (Figure
2b), which means that buried water alone is unlikely to account for the high water access of T75Hβ. Remarkably, an ordered water molecule was also cocrystallized in the inactivated ﬁlter at the S3 position.13 Such water, as shown by simulations, is very close to T75Hβ (Figure 2b,d), often closer than 3.0 Å, and would account for its high water access in the 13C detected experiments. This water in the ﬁlter featured residence times
around the microsecond range in the simulations (Supporting
Information Figure S1), which will be longer at the temper-
atures used in our ssNMR experiments (283 K). Taken together, our 13C and 15N detected ssNMR data, in
reference to simulations, provide a high-resolution map of the spatial distribution of ordered water around the selectivity ﬁlter. Buried water is spread all along the inactivated ﬁlter’s rear with
the exception of T74, and our data suggest ordered water at the S3 position in the inactivated ﬁlter (Figure 2d). In the

conductive ﬁlter, only the upper, extracellular part (G79) is in direct contact to buried water, while the rest of the ﬁlter is
devoid of it. Moreover, with a closed activation gate, T75 and
T74 seem to be in close proximity to the ordered hydration
shell of cavity ions (Figure 2c). High-Resolution 1H ssNMR To Probe Water Dynamics
Behind the Selectivity Filter. As an alternative and more
direct means to probe the presence of buried water molecules, we resorted to high-resolution 1H ssNMR that can be obtained
by using very fast MAS rates (see, e.g., refs 24,25) and/or by perdeuteration.26,27 In the latter case, 1H ssNMR requires the
reprotonation of protein sites via exchange with H2O. For membrane proteins, this process is signiﬁcantly slower for
residues that are not solvent exposed and shielded by the lipid bilayer.28 This property provided us with a unique opportunity
to directly track residues that become protonated due to buried
water on the time scale of channel recovery from C-type
inactivation. To ensure the identiﬁcation of water-accessible and non-
accessible amino-protons (1HN), we ﬁrst acquired 1H detected 2D 15N−1H experiments at 60 kHz MAS with fully protonated
open-inactivated and closed-conductive KcsA. As compared to previous work on microcrystalline proteins,29,30 these experiments resulted in remarkably narrow 1HN line widths of 0.3−
0.5 ppm (Supporting Information Figure S2) for a membraneembedded ion channel. Spectrally well-separated 15N chemical shifts of ﬁlter residues T74, G77, and G79 allowed us to identify their 1HN both in indirectly and directly 1H detected spectra (Figure 3a−d). To our knowledge, these assignments present the ﬁrst 1H site-speciﬁc analysis of a fully protonated membrane protein by 1H detected biomolecular ssNMR. The resolution in our 15N−1H spectrum of fully protonated closed-
conductive KcsA opened the possibility to monitor structural
changes in reference to function in the canonical GYG motive of the K+ channel superfamily. Crystal structures13 showed G77NH to ﬂip upon inactivation, and G77HN indeed exhibited a stark ssNMR resonance shift (+Δ1.8 ppm) to low-ﬁeld in the inactivated ﬁlter conformation (Figure 3a,c). As revealed by a computational analysis, the chemical shift change of G77HN may reﬂect the rotation of G77NH away from the ﬁlter’s rear, where G77HN is less exposed to the shielding ring-current eﬀect of Y78 (Supporting Information Figure S3). Moreover, the shift of T74HN toward high-ﬁeld (−Δ0.5 ppm) upon opening of the activation gate is in line with a ﬂip of the F103
ring-plane, facing T74, which was shown to be critically
involved in the coupling of activation gate and selectivity ﬁlter.3,31 Note that such investigations of proton chemical shifts
are precluded when using perdeuterated samples, because T74HN and G77HN are not exposed to water in all ﬁlter states
(Figure 1a,b).
Next, we sought to characterize the water dynamics behind the ﬁlter by ssNMR, which is essential to convey a functional
importance to buried water. Simulations demonstrated the
necessity of an interchange from buried to bulk water to initiate
recovery and implied long residence times for buried water to
be at the molecular origin of recovery. We intended to study
water dynamics by exploiting the exchangeable character of amino protons. For this purpose, we acquired 2D 15N−1H
experiments on a membrane-embedded perdeuterated (2H,13C,15N) KcsA sample, which was washed in an acidic (pH 3.5) H20 buﬀer solution. We compared our data to results obtained on the fully protonated channel, which allowed straightforward identiﬁcation of 1HN of G77/G79 as water-

accessible and the 1HN of T74 as nonaccessible (Figure 3e). Importantly, protonation of G77 and G79 conﬁrmed the
presence of a pathway from bulk to buried water that is restricted to the upper part of the ﬁlter. An analysis of the 1H line width showed that the G77/G79 1HN signal exhibits a
much larger (0.22 ppm) line width than other resolved crosspeaks (0.10−0.13 ppm), suggesting that both G77/G79 aminodeuterons exchanged to 1H (Figure 3e). These results provide
direct experimental evidence that bulk water can occupy the cavity behind the selectivity ﬁlter, as it was shown to be
required for slow inactivation, and also suggest the possibility of
the reverse process, release of inactivating water to the bulk, as required for recovery. Importantly, the 1HN assignments also
hint at the nature of the water hydrogen-bonding network behind the inactivated selectivity ﬁlter.22 While we observe (Figure 3e) that the 1HN of G77/G79 are water-exposed, and according to simulations15 directly hydrogen bonded to buried water, we simultaneously observe sharp G77/G79 15N−1HN and 15N−1HH2O correlations (Figure 3b). Hence, these experiments suggest that buried water resides behind the ﬁlter
on the NMR time scale (and possibly beyond, which is in line with computational studies,15 in which buried water remained bound behind the inactivated ﬁlter during a 17 us MD
simulation).
■ CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates the presence of several ordered water molecules surrounding the selectivity ﬁlter of membraneembedded K+ channels and that these water molecules are
directly correlated with the channel gating cycle. By combining
ssNMR experiments and computational data, we could sketch a
high-resolution map of the spatial and temporal distribution of buried water behind the ﬁlter that clearly shows a plus of water with extended residence times behind the inactivated ﬁlter and
corroborates the notion that buried water governs recovery
kinetics. Moreover, we demonstrated the presence of a pathway
that allows for the interchange of buried water and bulk water, as required for recovery and slow inactivation, and we ﬁnd
spectroscopic evidence for conformational changes of the GYG
signature sequence that accompany inactivation. We want to
emphasize that many of these experimental results were only possible by 1H detection in fully protonated membrane
proteins, an approach that bears the capacity to monitor
protons of all protein sites irrespective of their access to water.
Such studies may have far-reaching advantages to investigate exchangeable protons of the inner core of membrane and ﬁbril
proteins, which have been shown to be exceptionally stable.28,32,33
In general, our study illustrates the correlation between selectivity ﬁlter conformational space and the exposure to
ordered water consistent with the notion of water acting as an
inherent part of the gating mechanism that steers the sampling of selectivity ﬁlter conformational space. Such processes may be
of general importance to the regulation of potassium channels,
for instance, by heterogeneous channel opening kinetics, referred to as modal gating.16,34 In this study, we discovered
additional ordered water molecules that are located in and below the ﬁlter that could potentially act as regulatory elements
of channel function. Moreover, ordered water molecules may enhance the coupling of the selectivity ﬁlter to the rest of the
channel, acting as mediators that transmit conformational
changes in the pore helix and turrets, which are both sensitive to the membrane environment, to the inactivation gate.12,35

We have demonstrated the great potential of solid-state
NMR to investigate buried water molecules as an intrinsic part
of ion channels in a native-like environment with the prospect of studies in native environments.36 Such studies are of general
relevance for membrane proteins, and sources of buried water
as structural or functional modulators have been reported for transporters,37 G protein coupled receptors,38 and enzymes of the respiratory chain,39 to name only a few examples. As it was shown by solution NMR,40,41 such buried water molecules may
be further exploited as potential probes of intrinsic protein
dynamics and the underlying energy landscape.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy. SSNMR experiments were
performed using NMR spectrometers (Bruker Biospin) at magnetic ﬁelds of 16.4 and 18.8 T with 52 and 60 kHz magic angle spinning
(MAS), respectively. The sample temperature was 283 K (52 kHz MAS) and 300 K (60 kHz MAS). We used 2D 1H(1H)15N/13C and 3D 1H(1H)13C13C experiments (Supporting Information Figure S4) to
probe buried water molecules, transferring magnetization from rigid protons to protein heteronuclei 13C or 15N by a short crosspolarization step (200 us for 13C, 600 us for 15N). The slightly longer 1H−15N contact time was chosen to compensate for local backbone dynamics of the selectivity ﬁlter.42 To facilitate transfer from buried water molecules to the protein, a short 1H−1H spin diﬀusion step (1.2 ms in 15N and 0−2 ms in 13C detected experiments) was added prior
to cross-polarization. Our experimental setup is close to those used to
relate membrane protein bulk water-accessibility to membrane protein conformation,20,43,44 with the diﬀerence that a T2 ﬁlter to suppress rigid sample components was omitted to avoid relaxation of possibly
buried and rigid water molecules. Our experimental setup is sensitive
to water that is immobilized on the time scale of microseconds and
beyond. Note that the application of very fast MAS in this study allows
the observation of ordered water molecules without the necessity of 1H homonuclear dipolar decoupling during the 1H evolution time. 13C−13C spin diﬀusion mixing at 52 kHz MAS was carried out using PARIS17,18 with the standard pulse length = 0.5τrot (N = 0.5) and 30 kHz recoupling amplitude over 200 ms. Heteronuclear high45 (pulse length 0.9τrot) and low power46 PISSARRO decoupling was applied during all heteronuclear and proton acquisition periods, respectively. The MISSISSPI solvent suppression scheme47 was used in 1H detected experiments. 13C and 15N resonance assignments were taken from refs
12,21. Sample Preparation. Expression, puriﬁcation, and reconstitution
in asolectin of protonated uniformly 13C, 15N labeled KcsA followed
earlier work (refs 12,48). The perdeuterated KcsA sample was
expressed for 12 h to an OD600 of 1.3 in a medium containing 100% D20, uniformly 2H, 13C labeled glucose, and 15NH4Cl. Uniformly 2H,13C,15N labeled KcsA was washed two times for 1.5 h in 0 mM K+/ 150 mM Na+/10 mM H20 citrate buﬀer. Puriﬁcation steps where done in neutral H20 buﬀers. As in refs 9,12, samples at pH 3.5 were prepared by washing proteoliposomes with 100 mM citrate buﬀer, yielding the same ionic strength as the phosphate buﬀer used for pH 7.5 samples.
All reconstitution was performed at a 100/1 lipid/protein molar ratio. Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Initial coordinates for the
Molecular Dynamics simulations of the both the conductive and the pinched selectivity ﬁlters were taken from the crystal structures 1K4C and 1K4D, respectively.13 Crystallographic water molecules for each of
the four subunits of the channel were included at the start of the
simulations. With the exception of Glu71, which was protonated, all
residues were assigned their standard protonation state at pH 7.0. The
channels were embedded in a bilayer of POPC lipids and solvated in
1.0 M KCl using the web service CHARMM-GUI (total number of
atoms, 45 898). All-atom simulations were run at a temperature of 310
K under constant NVT conditions using the CHARMM PARAM27 force ﬁeld. Simulations of the conductive ﬁlter were run for 510 ns, while simulations of the pinched selectivity ﬁlter were run for 17.7 μs.
