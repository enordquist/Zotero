Abstract: The Onsager-Samaras version of Wagner's theory of surface tension of solutions of 1:1 salts has been modified to include ion-induced dipole terms in the image potential. Effective solvated ionic polarizabilities are used, which are large and negative owing to local dielectric saturation around the ions. The modified theory agrees with the order of magnitude of the variation among various alkali halides (e.g., A o for 0.1 molar aqueous KI is about 70% of the corresponding value for KCI). Polarizabilities were estimated from Hasted's dielectric decrements.

Simple salts, when dissolved in a inolecular solvent, raise the surface tension, o, by small amounts (in contrast with
I surface-active agents, which may depress the surface tension substantially at very low concentrations). The magnitude of the increase depends upon the charge and size of the ions and on the nature of the solvent. The functional form of the dependence of Ao (= o - oo) on concentration is very uncertain, especially the approach to zero concentration. Most data (1) for aqueous solutions are at concentrations above 0.1 mol L-I. Other properties of strong electrolyte solutions, such as equivalent conductivity and the logarithm of the activity coefficient, which are explained by the Debye-Hiickel theory or theories based on it, are represented by equations having a leading term in the square root of c. It would not be surprising if surface tension was similar in this respect:
[I] A ~ = A ~ & + B c
The leading constants, corresponding to Ao, for the other properties depend only on charge type and on ETto a negative power. To see whether this was the case with surface tension I also, data for half a dozen alkali halides in five solvents were

Theories Published theories fall into three groups: (i) direct calculations (typified by those of Oka (3) and Ariyama (4)) of the work of separation at a surface originally in the interior of the solution to make two new surfaces; (ii) calculations of the depletion ("negative adsorption") of electrolyte in a surface layer, followed by use of the Gibbs adsorption equation (see below); (iii) calculations starting from a radial distribution for the ions, and proceeding by statistical-mechanical methods ( 5 , 6). The main theories in the second group are (a) those of Wagner (7) and Onsager and Samaras (8) ("WOS"), modified by later authors (9, lo), and (b) that of PCres Masi6 and co-workers ( I 1, 12).
Binary mixtures of nonelectrolytes exhibit surface tensions that are lower than the values calculated with an assumption of additivity on a molar basis, i.e., :

the surface tension of pure component i and xi is its mole fraction. The reason for this is that the surface tension, which is the same as the surface free energy, is reduced by an excess of the component with the lower surface free energy appearing in the surface layer. Gibbs showed how to relate the surface excess ("adsorption") of one component to the decrease in the surface tension, through the Gibbs Adsorption Equation (13), a form of which is eq. [4]:

The local concentration is plotted as a function of the distance from the surface. .r; the quantity -T. which is the depletion (negative adsorption) of the solute, is the area between the curve and the horizontal line at c = I mrnol L-.'. It is equivalent to total exclusion of solute from a surface layer about 0.8 nm thick. (Recalculated after Onsager and Sarnaras's Fig. 2 (S).)

Here a is as defined above, a2 is the activity of component 2, R is the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, and F2 is the surface excess of component 2. The definition of F2 is somewhat dependent on the placing of an arbitrary plane that marks the geometrical surface (the real surface being actually a somewhat diffuse region). Gibbs showed that for dilute binary solutions it is always possible to place this plane so that the surface excess is equal to the integral of the local excess of component 2 (the solute) from the arbitrary plane into the body of the solution, to infinity, eq. [5]:

where x is the distance from the surface into the solution, and c(x) and c(m) are the concentrations at x and oo ("bulk").
Where the solute is a strong electrolyte, each of the ions interacts with the surface, independently of the others in the limit of extreme dilution. By treating the surface as a plane that divides space into two regions, one the solvent, with electric permittivity E, and the other the gas or vapour, with a permittivity essentially equal to the permittivity of free space, E ~it ,may be shown (14) that an ion of charge ze will be subject to a repulsive force equal to that which would be
exerted by a charge of magnitude z e ( ~- E ~ ) / (+EEO)at the
place where the image of the ion would be were the surface a mirror, with the permittivity everywhere equal to E. This results in the ion having an x-dependent contribution to its potential energy, given by eq. [6],
where f = (E- E ~ ) / (+EE ~ )t,he ratio of the image charge to
the real charge. The extra factor 4 in the denominator arises because, in the integration of the force to obtain the potential energy, one must take account of the motion of the image as the ion is moved.
The dependence of concentration on distance from the surface is then obtained as c(x) = c(m)exp(-WlkT), where k is Boltzmann's constant. WOS show that this leads to F's being negative and infinite. At any finite concentration of electrolyte, however, the range of the Coulombic force of repulsion (the "image force") should be limited by the effect of the ionic atmosphere, being attenuated by the Debye-Huckel factor e x p ( - ~ r ) .The radial coordinate r causes intractable mathematical complications; it was replaced by Wagner by a new coordinate parallel to x , and by Onsager and Samaras by 2x (because the distance from the image to the real ion is 2x). The Debye-Huckel reciprocal length K is not constant in the region of the solution where the concentration is not uniform. Onsager and Samaras argue that the value corresponding to

the bulk concentration may be used without serious error. With these simplifications, they obtain a dependence of concentration on distance from the surface of the form shown in Fig. 1 (redrawn from part of Onsager and Samaras's Fig. 2). The area between the curve and the horizontal line at c(~ o,o) is the quantity -F. Treatment of the liquid as a continuous dielectric should break down within molecular distances from the geometrical surface. Fortunately this is just the region that is essentially salt free. Integration of the Gibbs equation then gives o(a) or a(c).
PCrez MasiA and co-workers ( 1 1, 12) begin by calculating the Born solvation energy of the ions, and then the loss of solvation due to truncation of the solvation sphere by the surface. They then proceed to calculate c(x) aid -F essentially as WOS, except that they explicitly calculate the effect of the difference in the solvation of the cation and anion. Any difference in the degree of repulsion from the surface creates an electrical double layer; this gives rise to an additional effect that they calculate through the Lippman-Helmholtz equation:
where E is the surface potential, and q is the surface charge density, defined by the middle term. The subscripts indicate that the derivatives are at constant temperature, pressure and composition. This additional effect (which would lead to a decrease in surface tension) is small when the ions have equal and opposite charges. It was neglected by WOS, and is neglected in this work.
All of these theories predict concentration dependence that is either linear for strong electrolytes or slightly concave towards the concentration axis. The curvature arises from two sources: (a) at higher concentrations from ion pairing (e.g.,

Oka (3b): he includes a factor a for the degree of dissociation) or from the activity coefficient (e.g., WOS) and (b) at low concentrations from a term proportional to -cln(c) (WOS and successors). Nichols and Pratt (15) show that in their application of the WOS approach to interfacial tension between two liquids the leading term may have the form either -cln(c) or el/', depending on the difference in the degree of repulsion from the surface between the anion and the cation, especially if the salt shows some solubility in both liquids. Unfortunately the effect is so small that these two forms of dependence on c are experimentally indistinguishable.
In reviewing these various theories from the point of view of an engineer seeking smoothed or estimated values, Horvath (16) concludes that for lower concentrations (below about 0.1 mol L-I), WOS best represents the data. (He prefers Schmutzer (5), Buff-Stillinger (6), or Molyneux (17) at higher concentrations, although their derivations are also for very dilute solutions.) The chief problem seems to be that WOS underestimate the effect of ionic size. Onsager and Samaras themselves also say that they slightly underestimate the magnitude of the main effect (8).
Calculations Onsager and Samaras, in calculating the "image" force, treat the ions as having no properties except charge and size, but, without elaborating, they mention the possibility of including polarizability. M.J. Sienko, in about 1953, suggested in conversation' that we should explore the addition of polarizability to see whether it might account for ionic size effects more realistically. The calculation seemed too difficult, and, except for a rough order-of-magnitude estimate, we were unable to pursue the problem at that time. The present paper is the belated fruit of Sienko's suggestion.
To allow for the size of the ions, WOS modify the potential energy of the ion by introducing the Debye-Huckel distance of closest approach, a, and arrive at the form (their eq. 19):

local field and the polarizability a. The force on the dipole is given by the product of the dipole moment and the derivative of the field:
and the potential energy W p due to this force is:
(The constant of integration is taken to be zero, the force and the potential energy both being zero at great distance.)
By itself, this term, which is attractive if a is positive, causes the potential energy of an ion at the surface to be large and negative, so the area l- again becomes infinite and positive. Since the effective polarizability of a solvated ion is always negative, however (see below), the area remains finite and negative. A term representing the (induced) dipoledipole potential was originally added. Since the range of the corresponding force is short, it serves only to reduce further the concentration very close to the surface, from which the solute is nearly totally excluded by the other forces. Its effect is therefore negligible.
'The final form of the potential function is now:
where 11 = ~ K =X ~ K ( ~ c '(/w~rixting KO for ~ / c l / ' ) , and

(where x is the distance from the surface, a and K are the Debye-Huckel distance of closest approach and ionicatmosphere parameter, E is the permittivity, z is the charge number, e is the elementary charge, and we have here restored the omitted f , the ratio of the image to the real charge:
(E - &"I/(&+&")I.
We now add a term, the sum of two identical terms, for the potential energy W p due to the force (i) between the image charge and the induced dipole at the real ion and (ii) between the image of the induced dipole and the real charge. To obtain this term, consider the local field, E, which is (in one dimension) the derivative of the potential due to the image:
The induced dipole moment, p, is equal to the product of the

Then the concentration as a function of distance from the surface:

followed by integration of the Gibbs equation, eq. [4], to obtain Ao(c). Corrections for the activity coefficient were made following Onsager and Samaras (8). They state that the effect of the added term linear in ionic strength to the extended Debye-Huckel equation makes little difference. By the use of Davies's approximation (18) to the extended Debye-Hiickel equation for aqueous solutions at 25°C:

where I is the ionic strength in mol/L, we found that it does indeed make a difference at concentrations above 0.1 mol L-I for 1:1 electrolytes; presumably it is even more important with ions of higher charge.
Polarizability We have not yet discussed the choice of the values for the polarizabilities of the solvated ions. Hasted, Ritson, and Collie (19) have considered this problem and have made (very difficult!) measurements of the effect of dissolved salts on the permittivity of water, in the limit of low frequency, expressing the results in the form:
The factor 6 is called the "dielectric decrement," for the effect of the ions is to strongly orient the solvent molecules in their vicinity, much reducing their freedom to respond to an applied field, and so decreasing E below the solvent value, E ~ T. he measurements were made at concentrations from 0.5 molar upwards and extrapolated to zero concentration. The authors make a somewhat arbitrary division of the observed values between cation and anion, and report for univalent ions: H+ -17, Li+ -1 1, Na+ -8, K+ -8, Rb+ -7, F- -5, C1-3, I- -7, and OH- -13 (all k0.5) L mol-1. The relative magnitudes accord more or less with expectation, those for the cations diminishing as the radius increases, a trend that seems to be followed also by fluoride and chloride. Iodide
- seems to be anomalous. That H+ and OH- show the largest
effects in their respective series is not surprising, considering their unusually large mobilities in water and their special structural relation to that solvent.
To translate the dielectric decrement into effective polarizability, we use the mixing rule for a dilute suspension of spheres of permittivity e l in a medium of permittivity E,? eq. [18] (20):
(Here Q2 is the volume fraction of the suspended spheres.) Writing the volume fraction Q2 in terms of the molar concentration c, and noting that one mole of a symmetrical electrolyte contains two moles of particles (eq. [19]),
(v is the volume of a sphere and L is Avogadro's constant), we obtain eq. [20]:
Bleaney and Bleaney (21) express the polarizability of such a suspended sphere by eq. 1211:
Eliminating the volume of the spheres between eqs. 1201 and [2I], we obtain eq. 1221:

Can. J. Chem. Vol. 73, 1995
which, by comparison with the Hasted equation (eq. [17]), allows us to write:
The bars are added to indicate that the properties 6 and a refer to averages of the properties of the two ionic species. The numerical value of the proportionality constant G is 6.52 x
mol in aqueous solutions at 25"C, taking E, = 78.304 EO and assuming = 2 ~ 0c, lose to the "optical" value. (The Hasted values of 6 are in L mol-I , and should be expressed in m3 mol-' to obtain polarizabilities in m3. The value for a salt is the average, not the sum, of the ionic values.)
Results and discussion
The calculated values of A a (= a - oo) for concentrations from 0.0004 to 0.100 molar for uni-univalent electrolytes with mean effective ionic polarizabilities from zero to -2.0 nm3 are listed in Table 1. For a = 0 they are in close (though not exact) agreement with those calculated by Onsager and Samaras (8). Figure 2 shows the results of this work plotted as ~ a / cvs. logloc. The lowest curve is for a = 0. A few of Onsager and Samaras's calculated values are shown: their simplest calculation, ignoring the activity coefficient and the size of the ions, as squares, and their full calculation as crosses. The small differences are due to slightly different values of the fundamental constants used, slightly different values (22)' for E and (following Bravina (23) the restoration
of the factor (E- E ~ ) / (+EEO) in the magnitude of the image
charge, which WOS omit. The circles represent very careful measurements by Long and Nutting (24) on KC1 solutions. As noted above, they are somewhat higher than the calculated values, except at the lowest concentrations, where Long and Nutting suggest that they may not have quite eliminated the Jones and Ray effect (25).4 The upper curves represent the results of this work with a varied, plotted in the same fashion. Values of -a used were 0.5, 1.O, 1.5, and 2.0 nm3. (cf. argon: a = 0.00166 pm3.) The value of -a required to reproduce the experimental results for KC1 is greater than 2 nm3. The additional effect, a ( a ) - o(0) at c = 0.100 mol L1is closely proportional to (-a)Il2. The value -a = 0.36 nm3 corresponds to 6 = -5.5 L mol-' for KC1 (Hasted (20), p. 140).
It appears that the present theory using these effective polarizabilities is able to predict only very approximately the effect of ion size differences on surface tension for 1:1 salts, as represented by the alkali halides. There also remain some puzzles, the chief of which is the behaviour of strong acids. The Hasted dielectric decrement value for HCI is -10 L mol-' , which translates to an effective polarizability of - 1.3
' For temperatures other than 298 K, quadratically smoothed
values were used. The Jones-Ray effect consists of an apparent depression of the surface tension of salt solutions at very low concentrations, as measured by the method of capillary rise. Langmuir's explanation of the effect as due to the electrical double layer at the glass-solution interface (26) has been generally accepted.

nm3, and predicts a surface tension increment higher than for any of these salts. Experimental values are much lower, in fact slightly negative (1). Some structural or other special effect arising in the surface from the close relation of the hydronium ion to water must be operating. Among the alkali halides, Hasted's values of 6 do not correlate very well with other properties that would be expected to show similar

trends with changes in ionic radii (e.g., entropies of solvation, viscosity B coefficients). The value of 6 for KI is more negative (-8) than that for KC1 (-5), but measured surface tension increments(") are nearly 30% smaller.
The effects of variation of temperature, and of independent variation of the temperature, the permittivity, and the ionic charge (symmetric electrolytes only) were explored. The nature of the solvent might be expected to appear, given the electrostatic basis of the calculation, as proportionality to the permittivity to some negative power. Available data (27) do not give this much support. Good data for nonaqueous solvents are hard to find. Part (a) of Table 2 lists calculated values of the relative increment of surface tension for 1: I salts at several concentrations and at several temperatures. Part (b) of the same table lists the results of similar calculations, but with the relative permittivity ("dielectric constant," D = E/E") fixed at the value appropriate to 298 K. In Part (c) the temperature is fixed at 298 K, with the dielectric constant varied from 60 to 100. The last column of Table 2(b) lists the values of the slopes of plots of the calculated values as log(Av/c) vs. log (T). The temperature effect appears to work mainly indirectly, through the temperature dependence of the permittivity, the factor RT in the Gibbs equation and the Boltzmann factor exp(-WlkT) having contrary effects. The slopes in Table 2(b) show the near-cancellation of the direct temperature effects. Part (c) of Table 2 shows the result of varying the dielectric constant while keeping T constant. The last column, analogous to that in Part (a), shows that the effect depends approximately on D-', in the range explored.
The dependence on charge type is curious. I na'ively ex-
pected dependence on the charge as z or z 2 , and propor-
tionality to the number of ions of each kind. This would lead to the effects of, e.g., LiCl, BaC12, and MgS04 being
in the ratios 1:2:2 (if proportional to z ) or 1:3:4 (if z". In

haviour of Ao/c for z = 2 and 3 in Table 3.
In conclusion, it should b e pointed out that comparison of these and other theoretical calculations of surface tension of electrolyte solutions with experiment is difficult owing to the paucity of data for sufficiently dilute solutions. The present theory and all the other theories cited here were derived using assumptions that are most appropriate at very low concentrations, while the data mostly refer to concentrations much
above 0.1 molar. Trustworthy data for nonaqueous systems
in any concentration range are especially rare.
