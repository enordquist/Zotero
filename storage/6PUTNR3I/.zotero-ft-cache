DFSls were grouped in "bins" of 250 km (for example, distance between cell centers 0 to 250 km and 250 to 500 km). This allowed for horzontally and vertically adjacent grid cells (center distance, 150 km) and diagonally adjacent grd cells (center distance -212 km) to be combined. Means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals of DFSls

were calculated for each bin. 33. The following steps were followed separately to con-

to cells matching those present in the same time
period. This procedure resulted in a set of Monte Cario faunas comparable to the real faunas of the late Pleistocene and late Holocene. 34. We thank E. C. Grimm for discussions of TWINSPAN

*RESEARCH ARTICLES
Structural Analysis of Substrate Binding by the Molecular Chaperone DnaK

DnaK and other members of the 70-kilodalton heat-shock protein (hsp7O) family promote protein folding, interaction, and translocation, both constitutively and in response to stress, by binding to unfoided polypeptide segments. These proteins have two functional units: a substrate-binding portion binds the polypeptide, and an adenosine triphosphatase portion facilitates substrate exchange. The crystal structure of a peptide complex with the substrate-binding unit of DnaK has now been determined at 2.0 A resolution. The structure consists of a (-sandwich subdomain followed by at-helical segments. The peptide is bound to DnaK in an extended conformation through a channel defined by loops from the ,B sandwich. An ot-helical domain stabilizes the complex, but does not contact the peptide directly. This domain is rotated in the molecules of a second crystal lattice, which suggests a model of conformation-dependent substrate binding that features a latch mechanism for maintaining long lifetime complexes.

identity with its eukaryotic homologs. Polypeptide substrate binding and re-
lease by hsp7Os is facilitated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. DnaK and other hsp70s have relatively strong binding affinity for ATP but are slow adenosine triphosphatase (ATPases) (6). Binding of ATP to DnaK leads to the release of substrates and possible rebinding of others (712). With the hydrolysis of ATP, DnaK is switched back into the ADP-bound form, which exchanges substrates slowly. The ATPase and substrate-binding activities of
DnaK and other hsp70s are divided into two separable functional units: the NH2terminal half (-44 kD) has ATPase activity but no peptide affinity, and the COOHterminal half (-27 kD) binds polypeptide substrates (13-15). Genetic data and in vitro studies suggest that DnaK acts together with two other heat-shock proteins, DnaJ and GrpE (5, 10). GrpE is a nucleotideexchange factor that binds sub-stoichiometrically to the ATPase unit (16, 17), and DnaJ binds both to denatured and to certain native proteins and probably to the substrate-binding unit (18, 19).
The crystal structure of the ATPase unit of bovine hsc70, the constitutively present

Molecular chaperones of the 70-kD heat
shock protein (hsp7O) family are present in the cells of all organisms, and in eukaryotes they occur in all major cellular
compartments. They are named for their selective expression in response to metabolic stress, but they are also expressed normally and participate in various cellular processes, including the folding of nas-
cent polypeptides, assembly and disassembly of multimeric protein structures, membrane translocation of secreted proteins,
and protein degradation (1). Current understanding of hsp70 function follows

from the initial suggestion by Pelham (2)
that they bind to aggregation-prone exposed hydrophobic surfaces that may be induced by stress and from Rothman's extension (3) that both the response to stress and other functions such as translocation
and nascent chain folding involve the antifolding activity of polypeptide binding to prevent aggregation. DnaK, originally identified for its DNA replication by bac-
teriophage A in Escherichia coli (4) is the bacterial hsp70 chaperone with both constitutive and stress-induced functions (5). It shares about 40 to 50 percent sequence

Biochemical and biophysical experiments directed toward characterizing the specifici-
ties of the hsp7O substrate-binding unit with unfolded substrates or synthetic peptides (15, 17, 22-25) indicate that exposed hydrophobic residues are generally required for substrate binding to hsp7O. Furthermore, the
substrate peptide is shown to bind to hsp70 in an extended conformation (26).
We have crystallized the substrate-binding unit of DnaK in the presence of a synthetic peptide and have determined the structure by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing (27) applied to the selenomethionyl analog (28). The anal-
ysis reveals that this is a two-domain unit, and the structure in a second crystal lattice shows a relative movement between the
two domains. The structure reveals charac-
teristics of the substrate-binding site. Analysis of conformational variations with respect to biochemical data on hsp7Os provides us with mechanistic insights into the function of these proteins.
Structure determination. Crystals of
peptide complexes with DnaK from E. coli were obtained from recombinant fragments defined by proteolysis (29). The expression, purification, and crystallization procedures
are summarized in Table 1. Initial crystals grown from the full-length COOH-terminal fragment 384-638, complexed with the NRLLLTG peptide (15, 30), proved to be derived from proteolytic truncation at residue 609. These orthorhombic type 1 crystals and related type 2 crystals from the fragment
at 384 to 609 both grew slowly and not very reproducibly; typically they were small and could not be grown from the selenomethionyl analog (28). Our searches for heavyatom derivatives failed. Further analysis de-
fined a smaller fragment, 389 to 607. Type 1
crystals grew readily from this fragment and from the corresponding selenomethionyl protein. The NRLLLTG peptide bound to these fragments with the same high affinity
as that shown for the complete COOH-
terminal fragment and for DnaK itself (15). The type I crystals are in space group I222 (a = 94.5 A, b = 116.6 A, and c = 37.2 A) with one complex in the asymmetric unit and 43 percent solvent content. The type 2
crystals are in space group P21212 with two
complexes per asymmetric unit. An exceptionally large type 1 selenome-
thionyl crystal (-0.4 by 0.06 by 0.06 mm) grown by the s.it.ting-drop. dialysis method (31 ) was frozen and used to measure MAD

data at beamline X4A of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory). These data were analyzed with the MADSYS implementation of the MAD phasing method (27). The signals were strong (Table 1) since all six of the expected selenium sites proved to be well ordered. The resulting electron density map at 2.3 A resolution, a portion of which is shown in Fig. 1, was readily interpretable.

We used the graphics program 0 (32) to build an atomic model into this experimental map without ambiguity in the polypeptide chain trace. Diffraction data were also measured from native methionyl type 1 and type 2 crystals (Table 2), and the structure was initially refined against the somewhat superior native type 1 data. After 10 iterative rounds of model building and refinement, both the native and selenomethionyl

structures were refined to 2.0 A resolution with crystallographic R values of 19.3 and
20.6 percent, respectively (Table 2). The
type 2 crystal structure was determined by
molecular replacement from a partially refined type 1 model. This structure was re-
fined at 2.8 A resolution to an R value of 22.5 percent (Table 2). Residues 389 to 607
of DnaK and the entire peptide have been included in both type 1 models. Only residues 389 to 599 from one and 389 to 591 from the other DnaK molecule plus residues 2 to 5 from each peptide have been located in the type 2 crystal structure.
Structure description. The substratebinding unit of DnaK, which we describe primarily from the better ordered type 1
structure, has two parts. The first half is folded into a compact 1 sandwich, which is followed by an extended structure of ot helices (Fig. 2, A through C). The elements of secondary structure are defined in the topology diagram (Fig. 2D), and the extent of each segment is shown in alignment with the sequence (Fig. 3). From the skeleton (Fig. 2, A through C), the ,B portion appears to be separable from the ot portion. This proves to be somewhat illusory when we consider the disposition of buried side chains (Fig. 2E). Then helix aoA and the first half of the long second helix (oaB) are integrated with the first domain, whereas the remaining helical segments clearly are folded around a separate hydrophobic core. This division is consistent with sites of pro-
teolytic or genetic truncation that have produced stable fragments of hsc70 (13, 14, 16, 33). Helix aB then spans both of the domains as defined at the hydrophobic-core level of description, and this may have functional implications (see below). The substrate peptide is bound to DnaK in an extended conformation in the a sandwich. Helical elements are not directly involved in binding to the peptide. Instead, the helical domain appears to serve as a lid that encapsulates the substrate through latchlike interactions between the COOH-terminal half of helix otB and the outer loops of the 13 domain (outer is relative to the domain termini).
The overall structure has dimensions of -60 by 40 by 15 A. The longest dimension is roughly along the axis of helix aB, and the shortest dimension coincides with the direction of the peptide extension and is perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 2, A and B. This flattened profile (Fig. 2, B and C) corresponds well with the shape deduced from small-angle scattering measurements on a peptide-binding fragment (338 to 554) from bovine hsc70 (34).
The 13-sandwich subdomain comprises residues 393 to 502 arranged in two sheets with four antiparallel 13 strands in each.

Both the topology (Fig. 2D) and the extents
of strands in these sheets are essentially as
found in secondary-structure assignments
from the NMR analysis of rat hsc70 (21).
The bottom sheet (Q3, 16, 17, 18) is a
rather regular, twisted 1B sheet with hairpin
1 turns connecting the successive strands, whereas the top sheet (15, 134, 13, 132) is
highly irregular (top and bottom are as
viewed in Fig. 2). Irregularity in the top
sheet is associated with distinctive loops
that emanate from the sandwich proper to
form the substrate-binding site. Only short segments of strands 13 and 12 are in the
sandwich itself; the hairpin end diverges
away from the sandwich to form the first
loop and, after breaks in hydrogen bonding, the other end is turned to seal off what otherwise would be an open edge of the sandwich. Strands in one sheet are rotated by about 20° clockwise relative to the other
when viewed from outside the sandwich
(Fig. 4A). We are not aware of other struc-
tures with this 13-sandwich topology or three-dimensional architecture.
It is the loops off the upper 13 sheet that particularly distinguish this 13 structure. Two
inner loops, £1 2 and £45, are at one side of the substrate-binding channel (inner with
respect to the connections to other do-
mains), and two outer loops, 234 and 25,6, are at the other side (Fig. 2B). Loop £1,2
(402 to 409) between 131 and 132 includes hairpin hydrogen bonding and a tight turn.
Loop £4,5 (444 to 451 ) connects strands 14
and 15 and is wider (more open). These two inner loops are related in part by a quasi-diad
axis of symmetry (Fig. 4A) that superimposes defining 1 bulges in 12 and 15, which in turn project the loops out almost perpendicular to the top 1 sheet. There are three crossover connections between the sheets.
Two of these form the outer loops £3,4 (428
to 433) and £5,6 (462 to 470) that take part
in substrate binding. The third crossover, between 12 and 133, is effected by the only cis peptide bond in the structure at Pro419.
The loops £1,2 and 234 form the channel for
substrate binding directly. The integrity of the substrate-binding channel, however, appears to depend on the buttressing of loop
£1,2 by loop 245 through two main-chain
hydrogen bonds and by hydrophobic interactions between the loops. Similarly, loop
234 is stabilized by £5,6 through both main-
chain and side-chain hydrogen bonds. The NH2-terminal residues 389 to 393,
which begin in the hydrophobic sequence Val-Leu-Leu-Leu, have two alternative conformations. One (40 percent occupancy) is folded back into a hydrophobic pocket near the COOH terminus of the 1 domain (the "in" conformation), and the other (60 percent) is out into a lattice contact where it occupies the equivalent pocket in another

molecule (the "out" conformation). The linker that connects 18 to atA (503 to 508)
starts with a 1 turn and then adopts a notch-
like conformation from which the NH2-
terminus emerges for the "in" conformation. The second half of the substrate-binding
fragment of DnaK consists of five ot helices, which are improbably elongated if taken out of the context of the entire structure. Helices aA and atB are joined by a kink of 720 at Asn522, and together they span 58 A from residues 509 to 553. The segment in rat hsc70 corresponding to residues 507 to 530 in DnaK was designated as a single helix from the NMR analysis (21), but the possibility of a kink around the position corresponding to residue 521 in DnaK was noted from chemical shift and hydrogen exchange data. Thus, a similar tertiary structure for the two molecules seems probable. The long (31 residues) helix otB interacts through its COOH-terminal half with aC, aoD, and oxE. The successive interhelical angles of 1510, 1690, and 69° produce an antiparallel threehelical bundle from aoB-aD, whereas aE lies across one end of the bundle at 680 from aB. This helical domain (538 to 607) appears to be a relatively stable structural unit with a well-defined hydrophobic core (Fig. 2E).
The five-helix unit in DnaK is similar in

topology and general structure to a portion
of the helical domain found in the a sub-
units of G proteins (35). Helices aoB-oaE in DnaK correspond to oaA-oaD in transducin, and aLA in DnaK occupies a place similar to linker 1 in transducin (35). The respective helices and joining segments are similar in length, and the inter-helix angles are simi-
lar (240 average difference). The helical units in DnaK and Got subunits are disposed in a similar manner with respect to their
associated domains and, just as this results in encapsulation of the substrate peptide in DnaK, it entraps the guanine nucleotide in Gat. There are 31 COOH-terminal residues (608 to 638) missing from this DnaK fragment; coincidentally, the segment in Ga proteins between atD and the rejoining to a Ras-like domain is similar in length.
The at segment interacts with the 1 domain through axA and through its long helix aB. Helix axA makes hydrophobic con-
tacts with loop £4,5 and aB is in contact
with all four loops (£45, £1,2, £3,4, and £5,6) that form the substrate-binding site.
A total area of 1713 A2 is buried in this interface. Of this total, only 390 A2 is from interactions with the outer loops (£34 and £45) with the COOH-terminal half of axB (538 to 607). The interactions of atB with

crystallization conditions. Although the cell constants appeared similar to those of the first crystal form, this crystal form belongs to the space group P21212 without body-centered symmetry. The typical diffraction limit of these crystals was about 2.8 A. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with AMORE (53) with the protein model determined from the type 1 crystals and was refined to 2.8 A.

the inner loops contribute 742 A2, including a small hydrophobic patch of three res-
idues between the domains. The relatively small buried surface area between otB and the outer loops of the I subdomain is com-
patible with the suggestion (see mechanistic implications below) that the helical domain acts as a lid that must be displaced as a unit for substrate binding and release.
Substrate binding to DnaK. The substrate peptide, which has the sequence NRLLLTG (15, 30), was identified in a phage display screen for high affinity binding to DnaK (15). It also conforms well to the profile of preferences found for heptapeptides binding to other hsp70s (22-24). This peptide is bound in an extended conformation (Fig. 1), as observed by Landry et al. (26), in a channel that cuts through the thin dimension of the substrate-binding unit (Fig. 4). The binding channel has a limiting cross-section of 5 by 7 A, and it is formed primarily by loops -1,2 and 234 from the
1-sandwich domain. There are no contacts
of the peptide with helical segments. Binding interactions between the peptide and DnaK center on Leu4, which is completely buried in a deep pocket. In anticipation of generality in substrate binding, we designate this as "hsp70 site 0" and number the sites occupied by other peptide residues plus and minus relative to site 0 (Table 3).
The peptide interacts with DnaK through numerous van der Waals contacts from its side chains (Fig. 4A) and seven main-chain hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4B), as well as additional main-chain van der Waals interactions. Side-chain contacts with DnaK are dominantly hydrophobic; overall, 75 percent of the van der Waals
contacts are to carbon or sulfur atoms and this rises to 95 percent when contacts to the main chain are excluded. The binding interactions are concentrated near site 0 on DnaK and the center of the peptide, but contacts occur over the length of the peptide except for residue 1 at site -3. There is strong correlation among the number of contacts, the degree of solvent exposure, and atomic mobility (average B factor) in the peptide (Table 3). Leu3 and Leu4 are relatively well ordered and highly buried, and they also contribute most of the con-
tacts. Arg2, Leu5, and Thr6 in sites -2, 1, and 2 are moderately buried, and they con-
tribute the rest of the side-chain contacts. Five of the seven hydrogen bonds with the peptide are contributed by protein backbone groups. The hydrogen bond between Gln433 Nc2 and Leu4 0 in site 0 is critical, but that between Gly7 N and Thr437 Oy in site 3 is somewhat questionable because of the poor ordering of Gly7. Thus, the binding is almost completely determined by the interactions of a five-residue substrate core

with hsp70 sites -2 to +2. Perhaps relevant to substrate release, all but one of the hydrogen bonds are made to groups on the
outer, 234 side of the binding channel.
The central site 0 is a crucial determinant of peptide binding. It contributes three

hydrogen bonds to the substrate backbone, and it provides a relatively large hydrophobic pocket that is occupied here by Leu4. This is a pocket of -5 A wide and 3 A deep on the floor of the binding channel (Fig. 4C). The side chain of Leu4 makes contact

(D) Surface electrostatic potential of the substrate-binding fragment of DnaK complex with the peptide. The orientation of the structure is the same as in Fig. 2B; thus, this side is at the NH2-terminal end of the peptide.

erates a hydrophobic arch over the top of the binding channel that contributes on either side to sites -1 and +1 for Leu3 and Leus (Fig. 4C). These sites are relatively unrestricted otherwise. Sites outside this central triad are even more open, and the electrostatic potential of this surface is largely negative. This is evident in Fig. 4D for the NH2-terminal side of the substrate binding channel, but it is even more pronounced at the opposite, COOH-terminal side.
Given the presumed spectrum of substrates for DnaK, one wonders what other peptides might be accommodated in the binding channel. Clearly, selectivity will be
greatest at site 0. A simple contact analysis of this hydrophobic pocket indicates that leucine is ideal, and that methionine or isoleucine could fit into the site in favorable
conformations if slightly close contacts are tolerated. Smaller side chains could also fit, but presumably with an energetic penalty for the residual cavity (36). For threonine or serine, however, a hydrogen bond from
Q-y to 437 0 would be possible. Adjust-
ments would be needed in the protein or the peptide backbone to accept phenylala-
nine, and the price to fit tyrosine or tryptophan seems unacceptable. The hydrophobic character of this site makes the binding of charged or polar side chains less likely, and proline seems to be excluded by the hydrogen-bonding approach of 0 427 to N 4. In general, the observed peptide 'p angles (Table 3) are disallowed for proline. Apart
from this, the geometric constraints on res-
idues other than the anchor residue at site 0 appear to be relatively unrestrictive. There is, however, a general hydrophobic character at sites +1 and -1, and a somewhat
negative electrostatic potential at more remote sites, which would be expected to bias
substrate affinities. These findings are remarkably compatible with data on hsp70
selections from random sequences. In par-
ticular, large aliphatic residues are strongly preferred in the central region, negative charges tend to be excluded throughout, and positive charges are favored at the ends of heptamers (15, 24). An observed prevalence of aromatics and leucine in alternating positions (23) is difficult to reconcile with the structure, however. The dominat-
ing influence of site 0 in substrate registration makes it difficult to align peptide sequences. Finally, whereas the polarity of the peptide in this structure is unambiguous, we cannot exclude by modeling the possibility of reverse-direction binding for other se-
quences, as happens for some SH3 domains
(37).
There are a number of other proteins
that, like hsp70, bind to polypeptide segments in proteins or to free peptides and do so with incomplete restriction on the se-

quences of ligands that can be accommodated. These include the class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen-presenting molecules, SH2 and SH3 domains, protein kinases and phosphatase, proteases, calmodulin, antibodies, the bacterial chaperone protein PapD, and the bacterial periplasmic transport protein OppA. Three-dimensional structures are known for peptide complexes with several such molecules (38). Apart from calmodulin, which binds to helical conformations, all of these are like DnaK in binding to peptide segments in extended conformations. Typically, the binding to extended segments involves both generic hydrogen bonding to the backbone and a few key specificity determining pockets. The binding interaction in DnaK is like this except that there is only one strongly determining pocket.
Peptide binding to MHC molecules, to which the hsp70 interaction with peptides has been likened (39) (somewhat inappropriately), is typical in having the peptide in an open groove. This is, of course, essential for the role of antigen presentation, but it is unnecessary or perhaps even undesirable for the role of hsp70s in preventing unwanted aggregation. Where MHC and hsp70 are similar is in their slow kinetics of release and binding. The half-lives of class II MHC-peptide complexes are measured in days (40) and hsp70-peptide complexes are also long- lived in the absence of ATP (9, 1 1, 12, 41). The functional reasons for such kinetic behavior differ in the two cases, but the structural basis for the phenomenon probably lies in the requisite for high activation energy conformational changes in association with complex formation and dissociation.

Comparison with other hsp7O proteins. We have selected bovine hsc70 and hamster BiP as well-studied representatives of major hsp70 classes and have prepared a structure-based sequence alignment with DnaK for the substrate-binding units of these proteins (Fig. 3). As has been appreciated (42), members of the hsp70 family are highly similar proteins. Overall, for the substrate-binding fragment that we studied (394 to 607) the pairwise identities range from 46 to 62 percent for the sequences
aligned in Fig. 3, which is slightly less than the corresponding identities in the ATPase unit (51 to 70 percent). What may be less well appreciated is the asymmetric distribution of this similarity. The 13-sandwich subdomain (394 to 502) is exceptionally conserved with a range of 65 to 76 percent pairwise identity and 60 percent identity among all three. By contrast, the compact ox-helical domain (538 to 607), which serves as a lid on the substrate complex, is much less well conserved with pairwise identities of 18 to 49 percent. The connecting helical portions (503 to 537) are relatively more similar at 31 to 49 percent pairwise identity, which is in keeping with their more intimate association with the 13 sandwich. The COOH-terminal segment (608 to 638) for which we have no structural information has very little commonality in sequence or length among hsp70 proteins.
The high degree of conservation in the 13 subdomain suggests that the backbone conformation in this domain would be virtually identical in all the members of the hsp70 family. One then expects that the substrate binding channel in other hsp70 proteins would be like that in DnaK. In particular, the major binding interactions of DnaK

with the substrate through backbone hydro-
gen bonds should be preserved. Further-
more, Gln433 of DnaK, which makes a hy-
drogen bond to the peptide through its side
chain, is absolutely conserved for the 30 hsp70 proteins that we checked. Residues that contact side chains of the peptide in this complex with DnaK differ from site to site in degree of variability in the hsp70
family. The hydrophobic pocket at site 0 is identically the same among the three proteins in Fig. 3, although conservative chang-
es of these residues are observed in other members of the hsp70 family members.
There is greater variation among hsp70 homologs outside the central binding site. First, the Met404 to Ala429 arch, which provides important hydrophobic contacts both at site -1 and at site + 1, is highly variable. In bovine hsc70, the residues corresponding to Met404 and Ala429 are an alanine and a tyrosine, respectively. These can be seen as complementary changes that would preserve the hydrophobic arch. In hamster BiP they are a valine and an alanine. Other observed combinations at the 404 to 429 arch include valine-alanine (as in mammalian BiP), leucine-alanine, threonine-alanine, and glutamine-cysteine. All of these could maintain the hydrophobic character of these sites. Second, there are distinctions in the electrostatic potential surfaces surrounding the substrate-binding channel. Whereas DnaK is electronegative on both sides, but especially so on the COOH-terminal side of the peptide, an homology-built model for hsc70 has both positive and negative patches near the COOH-terminal side and the model for BiP has slight positivity close to the NH2-terminal side. In summary, subtle differences in sequence preferences might be expected as has been observed in peptide binding studies (43, 44).
A few of the identically conserved residues (Fig. 3) are exposed on the surface (Fig. 2E). Some of these exposed residues, such as Pro464 and Pro466, which help to form the substrate-binding channel, appear to have a role in stabilizing the structure.
Others, such as Lys421, Lys498, and Thr500,
which are clustered on the bottom surface
of the 13 sandwich and Glu520 and Lys528 near the oaA to oxB kink, having no other obvious role, become candidates for inter-
action with the ATPase unit.
Conformational variation. Solution scattering and biochemical studies show that the function of hsp70 proteins involves very substantial conformational change (17, 33, 34, 45-47). The extent of change within the substrate-binding unit, as opposed to segmental changes relative to the
ATPase unit (34), has been less clear. From the structure of this complex, however, it now seems obvious that large intemal

further the emerging model for DnaK action (Fig. 5C).
Changes monitored by tryptophan fluo-
rescence (33, 45, 46), small-angle x-ray
scattering (34, 47), and proteolytic suscep-
tibility (17, 33) indicate that the ADP and ATP states are different and that the con-
formational transition is induced after ATP binding but before hydrolysis (46). It seems likely that large differences in the mode of
association between the units, rather than changes within the units, are responsible for the observations. Remarkably, although these ATP-induced effects do not occur in isolated ATPase units, they do occur for
molecules truncated at 554 of hsc7O (34) or at 538 of DnaK (33) as well as for intact hsp7Os. Although COOH-terminal portions do play a role (19, 52), direct interactions between the ATPase unit and the ox domain identified here as moveable, do not appear to be required for the transition. Instead, it appears that there must be a mechanism for transmitting the change through the substrate-binding unit to the flexible juncture at 536 to 538. Possibly the alternative conformations of the NH2-terminus observed in the structure here, which happens to be the inter-unit segment, play a role. The ATPase domain is joined to the 1 subdomain next to the juncture between (8 and oaA, and if the linker were displaced from its hydrophobic pocket at the 18-atA juncture, the precise positioning of oxB might be affected. This could then affect the equilibrium between open and closed states of the ax-helical lid. Conversely, the stimulatory effect on ATP hydrolysis from the binding of substrate of a DnaJ analog might be caused by a reciprocal effect on conformational equilibria. Contacts between the ot-helical domain and the (-sandwich subdomain must be affected by the bound peptide. In addition, DnaJ appears to bind to the COOH-terminal region of DnaK (19), which is shown here to comprise the
ax-helical domain. Thus, the binding of pep-
tide or DnaJ could stabilize the closed state of the ax-helical lid, which by this model would in turn favor the ADP state over the
ATP state, hence promoting hydrolysis. The ATP-driven lid opening transition
of DnaK that we describe above could couple with DnaJ to explain the concerted action by DnaK with DnaJ, or their homologs; DnaK and DnaJ can both interact with the same protein and with one another. When the conformational transition occurs in such a ternary complex, it should exert a force on the substrate to pull the DnaK-bound, loose polypeptide
out from the DnaJ-bound remainder of the
protein. In this way, during heat shock, misfolded aggregates might become disen-

tangled. In the translocation of proteins across membranes, coupling of the hsp7O conformational transition with the membrane-tethered DnaJ homolog should serve to pull the polypeptides from one compartment to another.
