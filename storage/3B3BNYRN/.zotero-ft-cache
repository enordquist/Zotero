a b s t r a c t We report here a combination of site-directed mutations that eliminate the high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ response of the large-conductance Ca2ϩ-activated Kϩ channel (BKCa), leaving only a low-afﬁnity response blocked by high concentrations of Mg2ϩ. Mutations at two sites are required, the “Ca2ϩ bowl,” which has been implicated previously in Ca2ϩ binding, and M513, at the end of the channel’s seventh hydrophobic segment. Energetic analyses of mutations at these positions, alone and in combination, argue that the BKCa channel contains three types of Ca2ϩ binding sites, one of low afﬁnity that is Mg2ϩ sensitive (as has been suggested previously) and two of higher afﬁnity that have similar binding characteristics and contribute approximately equally to the power of Ca2ϩ to inﬂuence channel opening. Estimates of the binding characteristics of the BKCa channel’s high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding sites are provided.

INTRODUCTION
Large-conductance Ca2ϩ-activated Kϩ channels (BKCa)* play an important feedback role in a number of physiological processes, most notably smooth-muscle contraction and neurosecretion, which involve changes in both membrane potential and intracellular Ca2ϩ concentration ([Ca2ϩ]) (Latorre et al., 1989; McManus, 1991; Robitaille and Charlton, 1992; Robitaille et al., 1993; Nelson and Quayle, 1995). To accomplish this function they have evolved a unique sensitivity to both these signaling modalities that manifests as a Ca2ϩ-dependent, leftward shifting of the channel’s conductance-voltage (G-V) relation (Barrett et al., 1982; Methfessel and Boheim, 1982; Moczydlowski and Latorre, 1983). Biophysical studies have shed considerable light on the mechanism by which voltage-sensor activation inﬂuences channel opening (Cox et al., 1997; Stefani et al., 1997; Diaz et al., 1998; Rothberg and Magleby, 1998; Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al., 1999; Talukder and Aldrich, 2000). Less is known, however, about the BKCa channel’s Ca2ϩ-sensing mechanism and it is upon this mechanism that the present work is focused.
BKCa channels (Fig. 1) are structurally similar to Kϩ channels gated only by voltage (KV). Four identical subunits, known by their gene name slo, form a fully functional channel (Shen et al., 1994), and the amino-terminal third of the Slo protein contains several membranespanning regions, including a pore domain and a S4 he-

lix that likely forms the channel’s voltage sensors (Adel-
man et al., 1992; Butler et al., 1993; Diaz et al., 1998; Cui
and Aldrich, 2000). Unlike KV channels, however, the Slo subunit contains a large intracellular domain that confers Ca2ϩ sensitivity on a voltage-gated structure
(Wei et al., 1994; Schreiber et al., 1999; Moss and Ma-
gleby, 2001). The COOH-terminal part of this intracel-
lular domain is termed the channel’s “tail,” while the
portion of Slo that precedes the tail is termed the “core”
(Fig. 1) (Wei et al., 1994). Neither core nor tail contain canonical Ca2ϩ-binding motifs, and so the origin of the BKCa channel’s Ca2ϩ sensitivity remains unresolved.
There is reason to believe, however, that the tail is involved in Ca2ϩ sensing. Transfer of a large portion of the mouse Slo (mSlo) tail to a Ca2ϩ-insensitive Slo homologue (Slo3) confers signiﬁcant Ca2ϩ-sensitivity (Schreiber et al., 1999), and 45Ca2ϩ binding to a tail polypeptide is re-
duced 56% by the mutation of ﬁve aspartates (Bian et
al., 2001) that are among ten acidic residues in an unusually well-conserved tail domain termed the “Ca2ϩ
bowl” (Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997). This domain con-
tains 28 amino acids, and mutations here have been shown to cause rightward G-V shifts at constant [Ca2ϩ],
shifts similar to those observed with the wild-type channel when [Ca2ϩ] is lowered (Schreiber and Salkoff,
1997; Bian et al., 2001; Braun and Sy, 2001). Thus, the Ca2ϩ bowl may form a Ca2ϩ-binding site.
Arguing against an exclusive or even dominant role for the Ca2ϩ bowl in Ca2ϩ sensing, however, are the fol-
lowing observations: when the same aspartates were
mutated in the full-length channel, the channel remained Ca2ϩ sensitive, its G-V relation still shifting well over 100 mV in response to changes in [Ca2ϩ] (Bian et al., 2001); and this has been the case for all Ca2ϩ bowl
mutations so far reported (Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997;

Bian et al., 2001; Braun and Sy, 2001). No mutation in the Ca2ϩ bowl has been shown to substantially alter the concentration range over which the channel responds to Ca2ϩ, and mutations outside the Ca2ϩ bowl have also been shown to cause rightward G-V shifts at constant [Ca2ϩ] (Diaz et al., 1998; Cui and Aldrich, 2000; Braun and Sy, 2001). Thus, if there is a Ca2ϩ-binding site in the Ca2ϩ bowl, then there are likely to be others outside this region as well (Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997; Schreiber et al., 1999; Bian et al., 2001).
To investigate further the role of the Ca2ϩ bowl in the Ca2ϩ-sensing mechanism of the BKCa channel, we made a series of mutations in the mSlo Ca2ϩ bowl and analyzed their effects on the energetics of Ca2ϩ-dependent gating. Our data argue that Ca2ϩ bowl mutations can eliminate the ability of a high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding site to promote channel opening, and therefore suggest that a Ca2ϩ-binding site is present in this region. In addition, however, we have identiﬁed another site, at the end of the channel’s seventh hydrophobic domain, that when mutated, also impairs Ca2ϩ sensing. And when the two sites are mutated together, all high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ response is lost. Thus, we propose that the BKCa channel contains two types of highafﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding sites, and in the experiments detailed below we estimate their binding characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Channel Expression
The BKCa ␣ subunit clone (mbr5) was propagated in the E. coli strains Top 10 or XL1-blue. In vitro transcription was performed with the “mMessage mMachine” kit with T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion). To record macroscopic currents ‫ف‬0.5–50 ng of cRNA was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes (stage IV-V) 2–6 d before recording.
Mutagenesis
All mutations were made with the Quick Change Site–directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and mutations were identiﬁed by

sequencing around the point of the mutation. Further, the coding regions of the following channels were sequenced in their entirety (wild-type mSlo [mbr5], ⌬896–903, M513I, ⌬896– 903ϩM513I, ⌬899–903ϩM513I).
Electrophysiology
Electrophysiological recordings were performed essentially as described previously (Cox and Aldrich, 2000). All recordings were done in the inside-out patch-clamp conﬁguration (Hamill et al., 1981). Patch pipettes were made of borosilicate glass (VWR micropipettes), and had resistances of typically 1–2 Mohms in our recording solutions. Their tips were coated with wax (Sticky Wax) and ﬁre polished before use. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp ampliﬁer (Axon Instruments, Inc.) or a list EPC-7 and a Macintosh-based computer system using “Pulse” acquisition software (HEKA Electronik) and the ITC-16 hardware interface (Instrutech). Records were digitized at 20-␮s intervals and low pass ﬁltered at 10 KHz. All experiments were performed at room temperature, 22–24ЊC. Before current records were analyzed and displayed, capacity and leak currents were subtracted using a P/5 leak subtraction protocol with a holding potential of Ϫ120 mV and voltage steps opposite in polarity to those in the experimental protocol.
Solutions
In general, recording solutions were composed of the following (in mM). Pipette solution: 80 KMeSO3, 60 N-methyl-glucamine-MeSO3, 20 HEPES, 2 KCl, 2 MgCl2, pH ϭ 7.20. Internal solution: 80 KMeSO3, 60 N-methyl-glucamine-MeSO3, 20 HEPES, 2 KCl, 1 HEDTA or 1 EGTA, and CaCl2 sufﬁcient to give the appropriate free Ca2ϩ concentration; pH, 7.20. EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the Ca2ϩ buffer for solutions containing Ͻ0.8 ␮M free [Ca2ϩ]. HEDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the Ca2ϩ buffer for solutions containing between 0.8 and 10 ␮M free [Ca2ϩ], and no Ca2ϩ chelator was used in solutions containing 100 ␮M free [Ca2ϩ]. 50 ␮M (ϩ)-18-crown-6-tetracarboxylic acid (18C6TA) was added to all internal solutions to prevent Ba2ϩ block at high voltages.
The appropriate amount of total Ca2ϩ (100 mM CaCl2 standard solution; Orion Research, Inc.) to add to the base internal solution containing 1 mM HEDTA or 1 mM EGTA to yield the desired free Ca2ϩ concentration was calculated using the program Max Chelator (Bers et al., 1994), which was downloaded from www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html, and the proton and Ca2ϩ-binding constants of Bers (supplied with the program) for pH ϭ 7.20, T ϭ 23ЊC, and ionic strength ϭ 0.15. The ability of 18C6TA to chelate Ca2ϩ, as well as Kϩ and Ba2ϩ, was also considered in these calculations using the following dissociation constants: Ca2ϩ 10Ϫ8 M (Dietrich, 1985), Kϩ 3.3 ϫ 10Ϫ6 M (Dietrich, 1985), Ba2ϩ 1.6 ϫ 10Ϫ10 M (Diaz et al., 1996). Free [Ca2ϩ] was measured with a Ca-sensitive electrode (Orion Research, Inc.) and the measured value was reported. Free [Ca2ϩ] measurements were precise to within ‫ف‬8%. Standard Ca2ϩ solutions for calibration of the Ca-sensitive electrode were purchased from World Precision Instruments (10Ϫ8–10Ϫ2 M). Endogenous [Ca2ϩ] in our internal solution before addition of Ca2ϩ chelator was estimated from the deviation from linearity of the Ca-sensitive electrode’s response at 10 ␮M added [Ca2ϩ], and was 16–20 ␮M. Endogenous [Ca2ϩ] was then compensated for when making Ca2ϩbuffered solutions.
During our experiments, the solution bathing the cytoplasmic face of the patch was exchanged using a sewer pipe ﬂow system (DAD 12) purchased from Adams and List Assoc. Ltd.
In the experiments of Fig. 5, Mg2ϩ was often added to the internal solution. When this was the case, the following solutions were used. For the solution containing nominally 0 [Ca2ϩ] and

10 mM [Mg2ϩ], our base internal solution described above was used with the addition of 5 mM rather than 1 mM EGTA, and 12.1 mM MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich 4.9 M stock). For the solution containing 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] and 10 mM [Mg2ϩ] our base internal solution was used without added chelator, and 90 ␮M CaCl2 and 10 mM MgCl2 were added. For solutions containing 100 mM [Mg2ϩ] our base internal was also used, except N-methyl-glucamine was not included, and then either 15 mM EGTA and 112 mM MgCl2 were added to create a solution containing nominally 0 [Ca2ϩ] and 100 mM free [Mg2ϩ], or 0 EGTA, 100 mM MgCl2, and 90 ␮M CaCl2 were added to create a solution containing 100 ␮M free [Ca2ϩ] and 100 mM free [Mg2ϩ].
Determination of G-V Curves and Fitting
Conductance-voltage (G-V) relations were determined from the amplitude of tail currents measured 200 ␮s after repolarization
175 Bao et al.

to a ﬁxed membrane potential (Ϫ80 mV) after voltage steps to the indicated test voltages. Each G-V relation was ﬁtted with a Boltzmann function (G ϭ Gmax/[1 ϩ eϪzF{V Ϫ V1/2}/RT]) and normalized to the peak of the ﬁt. All curve ﬁtting was done with “Igor Pro” graphing and curve ﬁtting software (WaveMetrics, Inc.) using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to perform nonlinear least squares ﬁts. Values in the text are given Ϯ the standard error of the mean.
RESULTS
Mutations at the Ca2ϩ Bowl Alter Ca2ϩ Binding
We began our investigation by mutating to alanine ﬁve contiguous residues (899–903) in the mSlo Ca2ϩ bowl, four potentially Ca2ϩ-coordinating aspartates, and a

proline (commonly a helix-breaking residue that might

structure of the surrounding region). Despite this fairly
dramatic manipulation, however, the 899–903A mutant
shares many functional characteristics with the wildtype channel (Fig. 2). Except at 0.8 ␮M where the mutant’s G-V curve is somewhat shallower, at most [Ca2ϩ]
the shapes of the wild-type and mutant curves are indis-
tinguishable (Fig. 2 F and Table I). The mutant and
wild-type G-V curves are also in similar positions at 3 nM [Ca2ϩ] (although the mutant’s curve is somewhat
right-shifted; Fig. 2 D and Table I). And perhaps most importantly, the mutant channel is still quite Ca2ϩ sensitive. Its G-V relation shifts over 150 mV as [Ca2ϩ] is in-
creased from 3 nM, a concentration too low to be
sensed by the channel (Meera et al., 1996; Cui et al., 1997; Cox and Aldrich, 2000), to 100 ␮M, near saturating for the channel’s high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding sites

related models (see for example Cox et al., 1997), zFV1/2 is equal to the free energy difference between open and closed at 0 mV (⌬G(0)o-c) (Cui and Aldrich, 2000), and thus ⌬zFV1/2 is equal to the change in this freeenergy difference (⌬⌬G(0)o-c) as [Ca2ϩ] is increased, a quantity, unlike ⌬V1/2, that depends only on the Ca2ϩbinding properties of the model (Cox et al., 1997; Cox
and Aldrich, 2000; Cui and Aldrich, 2000). For wildtype mSlo, ⌬zFV1/2,(3 nM to 100 ␮M), evaluated from Boltzmann ﬁts (see Table I), is 18.5 Ϯ 0.66 kJ/mol, whereas for the 899–903A mutant it is 11.1 Ϯ 0.60 kJ/
mol. Thus, the 899–903A mutation appears to reduce the degree to which 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] alters the channel’s
free energy difference between open and closed by 7.4
kJ/mol or 40%, and Eq. 1 suggests it must do so by re-
ducing either the change in afﬁnity that occurs at each Ca2ϩ-binding site as the channel opens (that is the ratio
KC/KO), or the number of binding sites the channel contains (n). This latter possibility is particularly inter-
esting, as it would suggest that the 899–903A mutation knocks out a subset of the channels Ca2ϩ binding sites.
Indeed, based on similar ﬁndings, Schreiber and Salkoff (1997) have argued that “(ϩ)-shifted” mutants represent a complete loss of Ca2ϩ-bowl function and that the channel’s remaining Ca2ϩ sensitivity arises from Ca2ϩ binding elsewhere.

177 Bao et al.

If this idea is correct, then mutations in the Ca2ϩ bowl more severe than 899–903A would not be expected to display a more severe phenotype, as under this hypothesis Ca2ϩ binding at the Ca2ϩ bowl is completely lost with 899–903A. To test this prediction, we mutated to alanine four additional residues in the heart of the Ca2ϩ bowl (895–903), three aspartates and one glutamine. Remarkably, despite the loss of 7 of 10 Ca2ϩ bowl acidic side chains, the 895–903A channel’s equilibrium gating behavior is still appreciably Ca2ϩ sensitive, and very similar to that of the less severe 899– 903A mutant (Fig. 2 E and Table I). Other than a small leftward (rather than rightward) G-V shift at 3 nM [Ca2ϩ], neutralizing an additional three acidic and therefore potentially Ca2ϩ-coordinating side chains had no further effect on G-V position as a function of [Ca2ϩ] (Fig. 2 D and Table I). Thus, the smaller 899– 903A mutation appears to be sufﬁcient to completely eliminate Ca2ϩ binding at the Ca2ϩ bowl.
To examine, however, whether deleting rather than altering Ca2ϩ-bowl residues might create a more severe phenotype, we also made the following deletion mutants: ⌬895–903, ⌬896–903, ⌬898–903, and ⌬899–903 deletions of 9, 8, 6, and 5 residues, respectively. Unfortunately, the ⌬895–903 mutant did not produce stable currents. The others, however, did express well and displayed phenotypes that are similar to that of the alanine-substitution mutants described above: little effect at 3 nM and a fairly large reduction in the power of 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] to shift the mSlo G-V relation leftward (Fig. 3). In fact, the phenotype of the smaller deletion (⌬899–903) is virtually identical to that of 895–903A, and that of the larger deletions differs primarily at 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ], where the G-V curves for ⌬896–903 and ⌬898–903 are 74 and 79 mV right-shifted relative to wild-type, rather than 56 mV as is observed for 895– 903A (Fig. 3 C and Table I). Despite this difference, the similar phenotypes of the ﬁve Ca2ϩ-bowl mutants described above suggest the disruption of a common function, and we might tentatively conclude that the alanine-substitution mutants (899–903A, 895–903A) and the smaller deletion (⌬899–903) cause a near complete loss of function at the Ca2ϩ bowl, whereas the larger deletions (⌬896–903, ⌬898–903) eliminate Ca2ϩbowl function.
Another Ca2ϩ-binding Site
The above conclusion implies, as has been suggested (Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997; Bian et al., 2001), that high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding sites, not associated with the Ca2ϩ bowl, are responsible for the remaining Ca2ϩ sensitivity of the mutants described above. To search for these sites we examined a string of three acidic residues (EED 520–522) just past the channel’s seventh hydrophobic segment (S7) in the intracellular part of the

core (Wei et al., 1994; Jiang et al., 2001). We mutated all three to alanine, but the resulting mutant showed little deviation from wild-type behavior (unpublished data). However, when we mutated a nearby residue, M513, as shown in Fig. 4 B, the mutation created a channel with a reduced Ca2ϩ sensitivity similar to that of the Ca2ϩ-bowl mutants described above (compare Fig. 4 B to Fig. 3 B, D, and F). Interestingly, M513 is at the end of S7, which places it 370 amino acids away from the Ca2ϩ bowl in the channel’s primary sequence. Thus, it could be that this mutation affects a different Ca2ϩ binding site from that affected by mutations in the Ca2ϩ bowl but with perhaps similar binding characteristics. As we know little, however, about the tertiary struc-

ture of the BKCa channel, it could also be that mutations at the two sites alter the same binding site.
To distinguish between these possibilities we made the double mutant M513Iϩ⌬896–903. If each mutation acts independently, then their effects should be additive; if they act on the same process, this would not be expected (Goldstein et al., 1994; Stocker and Miller, 1994; Hidalgo and MacKinnon, 1995). G-V curves from the double mutant are shown in Fig. 4 D, and, as is evident, to a ﬁrst approximation the mutations are additive. The two mutations reduce the mSlo channel’s Ca2ϩ sensitivity considerably more than either mutation alone. In fact, the mutant channel shows almost no response to [Ca2ϩ] below 10 ␮M, and it shows only a 45 Ϯ

3.6 mV leftward G-V shift as [Ca2ϩ] is increased from 3 nM to 100 ␮M (as compared with the 202 Ϯ 5.8 mV shift of the wild-type channel, Table I). Thus, the two mutations together create a channel with only a lowafﬁnity Ca2ϩ response, and interestingly the double mutant M513Iϩ⌬899–903, which involves the smaller Ca2ϩ-bowl deletion, displays an identical phenotype (Fig. 4 F).
Mg2ϩ Eliminates the Double Mutant’s Ca2ϩ Sensitivity
BKCa channel gating can be modulated by intracellular Mg2ϩ (Golowasch et al., 1986) and millimolar concentrations of Mg2ϩ have recently been shown to activate the mSlo channel via a site in its core domain that also

has a low afﬁnity for Ca2ϩ (Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et
al., 2001). As the double mutants described above show only a low-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ response, we tested whether the remaining Ca2ϩ sensitivity of the M513Iϩ⌬896–903 mutant is due to Ca2ϩ binding at this low-afﬁnity, Mg2ϩ-sen-
sitive site. We examined the shift of the double mutant’s G-V relation in response to 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] in the absence and presence of 10 and 100 mM [Mg2ϩ]. If Ca2ϩ binding at the Mg2ϩ-sensitive site is responsible for the double mutant’s low-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ response, then 100 mM [Mg2ϩ] would be expected to occupy this site and eliminate the effect of Ca2ϩ, whereas 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]
would be expected to inhibit but not eliminate the effect of Ca2ϩ (Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001).

Triangles represent 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]. Open symbols indicate the absence of Mg2ϩ. Grayed symbols indicate the presence of 10 mM [Mg2ϩ]. Darkened symbols indicate the presence of 100 mM [Mg2ϩ]. Each curve has been ﬁtted with a Boltzmann function. Bottom, plots of the change in V1/2 as [Ca2ϩ] is increased from Ͻ3 nM to 100 ␮M in the presence of either 0, 10, or 100 mM [Mg2ϩ]. (B) Same experiment as in A except the wild-type channel was used. Mean V1/2 values were determined
from Boltzmann ﬁts to the data from each experiment individually.

As shown in Fig. 5 A, these predictions were born out in our data. In the presence of 10 mM [Mg2ϩ] the ⌬896–903ϩM513I channel’s G-V shift, when exposed to 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ], is reduced from 45 Ϯ 3.6 mV to 24 Ϯ 3.4 mV, and in the presence of 100 mM [Mg2ϩ] it is completely eliminated (⌬V1/2 ϭ Ϫ2 Ϯ 6.8 mV, see Fig. 5 A, bottom). Furthermore, when the same experiment
is performed with the wild-type channel (Fig. 5 B), 100 mM [Mg2ϩ] does not completely eliminate the effect of 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ], but rather reduces ⌬V1/2 by an amount similar to its effect on the double mutant (Fig. 5 B bottom). These results argue that Mg2ϩ only effectively blocks the channel’s low-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ binding sites (as
has been reported, Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001), and that the weak Ca2ϩ response of the double mutant is due to low-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ binding at Mg2ϩ-sen-
sitive sites. Furthermore, the high-afﬁnity response of the wild-type channel must therefore arise from Ca2ϩ
binding at sites whose functional effects are completely
eliminated by the double mutant. This is remarkable, because it suggests the presence of three types of Ca2ϩ-
binding sites on the mSlo channel, one of low afﬁnity
whose effects can be blocked by high concentrations of

Mg2ϩ, and two of higher afﬁnity, one whose effects are eliminated by mutations in the Ca2ϩ bowl, and another whose effects are eliminated by mutation at M513.
Estimating the Ca2ϩ-binding Characteristics of the Channel’s High-Afﬁnity Sites
The mutations described above must cause complete loss of function at their respective sites; otherwise, the double mutant would respond to Ca2ϩ even after its low-afﬁnity sites are occupied by Mg2ϩ. Thus, they provide an opportunity to estimate the binding characteristics of the sites they disrupt. To do this, however, requires extracting from the wild-type and mutant G-V data the degree to which Ca2ϩ binding is affecting ⌬G(0)o-c, the free energy difference between open and closed in the absence of an applied voltage. That is, we would like to plot ⌬G(0)o-c rather than V1/2 as a function of [Ca2ϩ], so as to examine a physically meaningful Ca2ϩ-dependent quantity that is independent of the mechanism by which the channel responds to voltage, and yet readily interpretable in terms of the binding properties of the channel’s Ca2ϩ-binding sites.

A strategy which has been used to do this in the past is to ﬁt each G-V relation with a Boltzmann function and from the parameters of the ﬁt estimate ⌬G(0)o-c as ⌬G(0)o-c ϭ zFV1/2 (Cox and Aldrich, 2000; Cui and Aldrich, 2000; Jiang et al., 2001; Shi and Cui, 2001), and in fact this was the strategy we used above in examining the 899–903A mutant. In effect, it assumes a twostate model for the channel’s voltage-sensing mechanism, and then on the basis of this model estimates the effect of Ca2ϩ binding on the free energy difference that the applied voltage must overcome to open the channel. As discussed above, for the voltage-dependent MWC model (Fig. 6 B) this strategy is strictly correct (Cox et al., 1997; Cox and Aldrich, 2000; Cui and Aldrich, 2000).

Results of such an analysis for the wild-type channel and the ⌬896–903 and M513I mutants are plotted in Fig. 6 F, together with standard V1/2 vs. [Ca2ϩ] plots (Fig. 6 D). New data have been added for each channel at 71, 130, and 360 nM [Ca2ϩ] so as to get a better sense of the shapes of the resulting ⌬G(0)o-c vs. [Ca2ϩ] relations. Upon examining these relations, we see that the zFV1/2 values, or equivalently the ⌬G(0)o-c values, of the three channels are very similar at 3 nM [Ca2ϩ], indicat-
ing that the intrinsic free energy difference between
open and closed is unaltered by the mutations. Also, 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] causes a smaller change in the ⌬G(0)o-c values of the two mutants than it does that of the wildtype channel, reﬂecting a weaker inﬂuence of Ca2ϩ
binding on the channel’s closed-to-open conforma-

rigan et al. (1999) used to described the voltage-dependent gating of the mSlo channel. Horizontal transitions represent voltage sensor ac-

JC(V) and JO(V) are the equilibrium constants for voltage-sensor activation when the channel is either closed or open where: JC(V) ϭ JC(0)exp(zFV/RT) and JO(V) ϭ JO(0)exp(zFV/ RT); and L(V) is the equilibrium constant between open and closed when no voltage sensors are active and no Ca2ϩ is bound where: L(V) ϭ L(0)exp(qFV/RT). (B) 50-state mSlo model. Here Ca2ϩ binding occurs along the long horizontal axis, voltage sensor movement along the
short horizontal axis, and transitions from the upper to the lower tier indicate channel opening. The front face of this scheme corresponds to the model in A. (C) Simulated G-V curves from the model in B at the [Ca2ϩ] indicated on the ﬁgure. For more discussion of this
model see (Cox and Aldrich, 2000; Cui and Aldrich, 2000; Rothberg and Magleby, 2000). Parameters were as follows: JC(0) ϭ 0.066; JO(0) ϭ 1.10; z ϭ 0.51; L(0) ϭ 2e-6; q ϭ 0.4; KC ϭ 10 ␮M, KO ϭ 1 ␮M.

tional change. More interesting, however, are the shapes of the three ⌬G(0)o-c vs. [Ca2ϩ] curves. Over the [Ca2ϩ] range 3 nM to 0.8 ␮M, where V1/2 for all three channels is changing appreciably (see Fig. 6 D), ⌬G(0)o-c for all three channels remains nearly constant (Fig. 6 F). This is unexpected, because, according to the current view, it is only through altering ⌬G(0)o-c that Ca2ϩ binding alters V1/2. That is, Ca2ϩ binding is thought to shift the mSlo G-V relation, not because it
alters the channel’s voltage-sensing mechanism, but be-
cause it decreases the energy barrier this mechanism
must work against. Thus, V1/2 is not expected to change without a concomitant change in ⌬G(0)o-c, and the incongruity we observe between Fig. 6, D and F, suggests
that either this view is not correct, or the method we have used to estimate ⌬G(0)o-c is inaccurate, at least at [Ca2ϩ] less than ‫ف‬1 ␮M.

To test the latter possibility, we used a model of BKCa channel gating developed by Horrigan et al. (1999) that is more sophisticated in its voltage-sensing mechanism than the VD-MWC model. It supposes four voltage sensors, one in each subunit, that move independently to promote channel opening. Voltage-sensor movement is not required for channel opening, however, but rather promotes opening in a manner similar to Ca2ϩ binding in an MWC system. It also supposes a weak voltage dependence associated with its central closed-toopen conformational change, and not including Ca2ϩ binding, it consists of the 10 states illustrated in Fig. 7 A. Adding then four identical Ca2ϩ-binding sites that also allosterically promote opening leads to the 50-state model depicted in Fig. 7 B (Cox and Aldrich, 2000; Rothberg and Magleby, 2000). Although apparently complex, this model contains only seven free parame-

ters, and yet it has been shown to account for mSlo macroscopic currents over wide ranges of [Ca2ϩ] and voltage both with and without the BKCa ␤1 subunit (Cox and Aldrich, 2000) and, as well, gating currents at nominally 0 [Ca2ϩ] (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan
et al., 1999). Furthermore, a scheme of the same form
was developed simultaneously to account for mSlo’s sin-
gle-channel gating behavior (Rothberg and Magleby,
2000). Thus, the model illustrated in Fig. 7 B, although overly simple in its Ca2ϩ-sensing mechanism, represents the latest view of the relationship between Ca2ϩ binding
and voltage sensing in BKCa-channel activation. Fig. 7 C shows simulated G-V curves from this model.
The parameters used to generate these curves were
similar to those used recently to ﬁt wild-type mSlo data
(Cox and Aldrich, 2000). Adjacent to these curves (Fig. 7 D) the true ⌬G(0)o-c of the model is plotted as a function of [Ca2ϩ] (closed circles). These values were deter-
mined mathematically from the probability of open-
conformation occupancy at 0 mV. Also plotted (open circles) are estimates of ⌬G(0)o-c obtained by ﬁtting each simulated curve with a Boltzmann function and calculating ⌬G(0)o-c from the ﬁt parameters.
Interestingly, although the 50-state model assumes no direct effect of Ca2ϩ binding on voltage sensing, the Boltzmann method of estimating ⌬G(0)o-c severely underestimates the model’s true ⌬G(0)o-c at [Ca2ϩ] below ‫ف‬1 ␮M, where its G-V curves become both increasingly
shallower and poorly ﬁtted by a Boltzmann function,
characteristics also observed in the data (see Figs. 2–4).
Furthermore, the underestimation occurs in such a way that the estimated ⌬G(0)o-c vs. [Ca2ϩ] relation is almost constant between 0 and 1 ␮M [Ca2ϩ], when the true relation is changing by ‫ف‬23%. Thus, the unexpected, ﬂat
characteristic we observed in our analysis of the data in
Fig. 6 is also observed here, and it thus seems likely that in Fig. 6 F we are indeed underestimating ⌬G(0)o-c at low [Ca2ϩ] when using zFV1/2 as an estimator.
To attempt to better estimate ⌬G(0)o-c, we took advantage of the understanding of the voltage-dependent
mechanism of mSlo gating developed by Horrigan et
al. (1999). Instead of using a Boltzmann function, we
ﬁt each G-V curve with the following function, which
describes the G-V relation of the scheme diagramed in
Fig. 7 A (Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999; Horrigan et al.,
1999).

ing mechanism described by the scheme in Fig. 7 A, for any [Ca2ϩ], we may write:

∆G(0)O – C = 4RTln -11----++-----JJ--OC---((--0-0---))- + RTln[ACa], (3)
where the ﬁrst term in Eq. 3 does not vary with [Ca2ϩ] and the second one does.
Thus, we ﬁt the wild-type and mutant G-V curves with Eq. 2, ﬁxing the voltage-dependent gating parameters to values we have used previously to describe mSlo gating (Cox and Aldrich, 2000), and from the ACa parameter and Eq. 3 calculated ⌬G(0)o-c. This method of estimating ⌬G(0)o-c is precisely accurate for the 50-state model, and precisely accurate as well for any model with a voltage-sensing mechanism described by the scheme in Fig. 7 A, regardless of the number and type of Ca2ϩbinding sites it contains, as long as those sites do not directly interact with the channel’s voltage sensors.
Estimates of ⌬G(0)o-c as a function of [Ca2ϩ] for the wild-type channel and three of the mutants described above are plotted in Fig. 8 A. Supporting the idea that we have improved our estimates of ⌬G(0)o-c at low [Ca2ϩ], the ⌬G(0)o-c vs. [Ca2ϩ] relations for all four channels are no longer ﬂat in the 3 nM to 0.8 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] range, but now better follow changes in V1/2. In Fig. 8 B we have shifted each curve in A vertically so as to have a value of zero at 3 nM [Ca2ϩ], and thereby created plots of ⌬⌬G(0)o-c, the change in ⌬G(0)o-c as a function of [Ca2ϩ], a measure of the inﬂuence of [Ca2ϩ] on the energetics of channel opening. And in Fig. 8 C we have plotted difference curves obtained by subtracting each mutant’s curve in Fig. 8 B from the wild-type curve. These curves measure the Ca2ϩ inﬂuence lost by each mutation and thus are reﬂective of the properties of the binding site each mutation disrupts.
To estimate the Ca2ϩ-binding parameters of each site we then ﬁt each curve in Fig. 8 C with the following function, which describes the allosteric effect of four independent ligands inﬂuencing a central conformational change (Cui and Aldrich, 2000).

This relation has two free parameters, KC and KO, and listed in Table II are estimates of these parameters for the sites disrupted by each mutation. Examining the results from the ⌬896–903 and M513I mutations, we see that both types of high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding site appear to function similarly, each having an afﬁnity for Ca2ϩ of 3.5–3.8 ␮M when the channel is closed and 0.80–0.94 ␮M when the channel is open, and each maximally altering ⌬G(0)o-c by approximately Ϫ3.4 kJ/mol as Ca2ϩ binds, for a total of approximately Ϫ13.5 kJ/mol for each type of site. Also listed under site 1 in Table II, however, are afﬁnity-constant estimates derived from the WT ⌬899–903 difference curve in Fig. 8 C, because, as discussed below, it is not clear which mutant, ⌬896– 903 or ⌬899–903, represents elimination of just Ca2ϩ bowl function. The values derived from the WT-⌬899– 903 difference curve suggest a somewhat higher Ca2ϩ afﬁnity for site 1, both in the closed and open conformation (KC ϭ 1.8 ␮M, KO ϭ 0.6 ␮M), with a maximum ⌬⌬GCa(0)o-c per site of Ϫ2.4 kJ/mol for a total of Ϫ9.5 kJ/mol.
Are the Mutants Quantitatively Additive?
The data in Fig. 8, A and B, also allow us to determine if mutations in the Ca2ϩ-bowl and M513I act truly independently, as is expected if each affects a distinct binding site, and binding at one site does not inﬂuence binding at the other. To test this we plotted, in Fig. 9 A, the effects of 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] on ⌬G(0)o-c for the mutant and wild-type channels, and, in Fig. 9 B, the degree to which each mutation inhibits the wild-type channel’s response to 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]. Consistent with Fig. 3, the ⌬899–903 mutant is somewhat more responsive to [Ca2ϩ] than ⌬896–903 (Fig. 9 A), and thus it reduces the channel’s response to 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] (⌬⌬G(0)o-c; 3 nM to 100 ␮M) somewhat less (Fig. 9 B). Perhaps surprisingly, however, the double mutants involving M513I and either ⌬899–903 or ⌬896–903 behave almost identically. Thus, the extra effect of the larger deletion is not evident when combined with M513I, suggesting one pair of mutations is not completely additive. Indeed, the predictions of strict additivity are indicated on Fig. 9 B (solid black lines), and consistent with this observation, the effects of M513I and ⌬899–903 are

truly additive, whereas those of M513I and ⌬896–903 are less than quantitatively additive by 20%.
The meaning of this result is open to a number of interpretations. One possibility is that the two binding sites do not behave independently, in which case mutations that knockout each site separately would not be expected to be quantitatively additive when combined. Alternatively, it could be that the M513I and ⌬896–903 mutations have partially overlapping spheres of inﬂuence. This would also be expected to produce a less than additive effect. Thus, we cannot be certain which mutation ⌬896– 903 or ⌬899–903 best represents loss of Ca2ϩ-bowl function, and therefore in Fig. 8 C we have analyzed both.
DISCUSSION
We have described mutations at two positions in the mSlo channel’s intracellular COOH-terminal domain,

the Ca2ϩ bowl and M513, that when mutated individually decrease the channels response to Ca2ϩ by approximately half, as judged by G-V shifts in response to 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]. Furthermore, the effects of mutations at each site are largely Ca2ϩ dependent, suggesting they are primarily altering Ca2ϩ binding, rather than other aspects of gating such as voltage sensing or the intrinsic energetics of channel opening. Reinforcing this conclusion, we have analyzed the behavior of mutants at both sites in terms of allosteric models that provide a means of estimating the degree to which a given mutation alters the power of Ca2ϩ to inﬂuence the energetics of channel opening (⌬⌬G(0)o-c), a property that depends solely on the Ca2ϩ-binding characteristics of the channel. Results of such analyses suggest that mutations at each site decrease the energy that 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] imparts to the channel’s closed-to-open conformational change also by approximately half, as if each site were responsible for approximately half of the channel’s Ca2ϩ sensitivity.
Are There Two High-Afﬁnity Sites?
It is natural to question whether mutations that create similar phenotypes alter the same or different processes. One could imagine that although separated by 370 amino acids in the channel’s primary sequence, the Ca2ϩ bowl and M513 are oriented such that mutations at both sites alter the same process by which Ca2ϩ binding promotes opening. The observation that the combined effect of mutations at both sites is considerably stronger than mutations at either site alone, however, argues against this hypothesis. In fact, the double mutants, ⌬896–903ϩM513I and ⌬899–903ϩM513I, do not respond appreciably to [Ca2ϩ] below ‫ف‬10 ␮M, whereas the single mutants, ⌬896–903, ⌬899–903, and M513I, each start to respond to [Ca2ϩ] (as does the wild-type channel) at ‫ف‬0.1 ␮M. Thus, mutations at the two sites are qualitatively additive, and likely alter separate binding sites. Indeed, we ﬁnd that the energetic effects of ⌬899–903 and M513I, as shown in Fig. 9 B, are very close to quantitatively additive. The difference between the measured ⌬⌬Go-c value (3 nM to 100 ␮M) of the double mutant M513Iϩ⌬899–903 and the value predicted by strict additivity is 2.25 kJ/mol, a value that is Ͻ10% of the ⌬⌬Go-c (3 nM to 100 ␮M) of the wild-type channel, and less than is typically taken to indicate nonindependence in studies of interactions between mutations (1.5 kT or 3.69 kJ/mol; Schreiber and Fersht, 1995; Naranjo and Miller, 1996; Ranganathan et al., 1996). Thus, it would appear that the ⌬899–903 and the M513I mutations are acting independently and on separate Ca2ϩ-binding sites.
We cannot rigorously exclude the possibility, however, that the ⌬899–903 and M513I mutations affect a single binding site in such a way that they happen to be-

have additively. In fact, the combined effects of the ⌬896–903 and M513I mutations are less than additive by 5.47 kJ/mol, or 20% of the of the wild-type channel’s ⌬⌬Go-C value (3 nM to 100 ␮M). Here, one mutation partially obscures the effects of the other, suggesting a common process is altered. This result could also be explained, however, by supposing that the binding of Ca2ϩ at one site inﬂuences binding at the other, or more simply that in addition to disrupting the Ca2ϩ bowl, the ⌬896–903 mutation has a partial effect at the second site, a conclusion that also requires the presence of two types of high-afﬁnity sites. Thus, we think two distinct high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding sites are likely.
Supporting this conclusion, Bian et al. (2001) have found that the Ca2ϩ-bowl mutation 897–901N reduces the dSlo channel’s Hill coefﬁcient for Ca2ϩ activation by a factor of ‫ف‬2 at many voltages, a result consistent with the idea that the Ca2ϩ-bowl mutation disrupts one type of high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding site while leaving another intact. This same mutation also reduces Ca2ϩ binding to a fusion protein consisting of the last 280 amino acids of dSlo by approximately half. Furthermore, Schreiber and Salkoff (1997) have argued for a second type of mSlo Ca2ϩ-binding site based on the observation that mutations at the Ca2ϩ bowl alter the effects of Ca2ϩ, but leave the activating effects of Cd2ϩ unaltered. And in another series of experiments they divided the mSlo tail domain into four regions (A–D) and found that both region B, which contains the Ca2ϩ bowl, and region C which does not, can each confer partial Ca2ϩ sensitivity upon an insensitive mSlocore– mSlo3tail chimeric channel. Thus, the two high-afﬁnity site interpretation we have given our results is not at odds with previous work.
Do the Mutations Create Complete Loss of Function?
Does each mutation completely eliminate the effect of Ca2ϩ binding at the site it disrupts? The answer to this question appears to be yes, at least for the ⌬896–903 and the M513I mutations, as when both mutations are made together all high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ response is lost, leaving only a low-afﬁnity response blocked by high concentrations of Mg2ϩ. Indeed, Shi and Cui (2001) and Zhang et al. (2001) have extensively examined the ability of Mg2ϩ to activate the mSlo channel. Both groups concluded that Mg2ϩ activates the channel via a site separate from the channel’s high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding sites. This site was estimated to have an afﬁnity for Ca2ϩ of 0.6–1 mM when the channel is open and 2–3 mM when the channel is closed, and an afﬁnity for Mg2ϩ of 2–6 mM when the channel is open and 10–20 mM when the channel is closed (Zhang et al., 2001). For a channel with four such sites, a simple VD-MWC type model predicts that this low-afﬁnity site would start to inﬂuence the position of the mSlo G-V relation at

just above 10 ␮M [Ca2ϩ], just as we observed with our double mutants (simulations not shown). And it would be ‫ف‬90% occupied by 100 mM [Mg2ϩ] and therefore almost fully activated. Thus, our double mutant ⌬896–903ϩM513I acts exactly as one would predict if it creates a channel whose high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩbinding sites have lost their function, but whose lowafﬁnity Mg2ϩ-sensitive, Ca2ϩ-binding sites are still intact (Figs. 4 and 5). These results therefore lend further credence to the notion that the BKCa channel has low-afﬁnity, Mg2ϩ-sensitive Ca2ϩ-binding sites that are separate from its high-afﬁnity sites, and they pave the way for the study of these low-afﬁnity sites in isolation.
No Other Binding Sites
The results of our double mutant experiments also argue that the mSlo channel contains no other highafﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding sites besides those disrupted by mutations at the Ca2ϩ bowl and M513 and no low-afﬁnity sites that are not Mg2ϩsensitive. If either of these suppositions were not correct, then the ⌬896–903ϩM513I channel would be expected to respond to increases in [Ca2ϩ] in the presence high concentrations of Mg2ϩ via these as yet unaccounted for sites. Generally, no such response is observed. It should be mentioned, however, that although we saw no signiﬁcant change in the G-V position of the ⌬896–903ϩM513I channel as [Ca2ϩ] was increased from Ͻ3 nM to 100 ␮M in the presence of 100 mM [Mg2ϩ], we did see a small but consistent change in the shape of the channel’s G-V relation. The relation became more shallow by 27% (Fig. 5) as [Ca2ϩ] was raised. Whether this is due to weaker binding of Mg2ϩ at low voltages, or some real remaining Ca2ϩ effect will require further investigation.
Estimates of Ca2ϩ-binding Characteristics
Identifying mutations that cause a complete loss of function at mSlo’s high-afﬁnity Ca2ϩ-binding sites affords a unique opportunity to estimate the binding characteristics of these sites. Results of our analysis suggest that the site disrupted by M513I, which we refer as site 2, accounts for ‫ف‬50% of the Ϫ26.7 kJ/mol that 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ] imparts to the channel closed-to-open conformational change, whereas the Ca2ϩ bowl site (site 1) imparts 35–50%, depending on which mutation (⌬899–90 or ⌬896–903) is analyzed. Thus, type 1 and 2 sites appear to contribute roughly equally to the highafﬁnity effects of Ca2ϩ. Assuming one binding site of each type per subunit (four per channel), and taking our estimates from the ⌬896–903 mutant, we estimate KO for both sites to be 0.8–0.9 ␮M and KC to be 3.5–3.8 ␮M. Thus, both sites appear to have very similar binding characteristics. If, however, the channel has an unequal number of sites of each type, as might arise if one type of site is formed at the interface between subunits

186 Three Types of BKCa Ca2ϩ Binding Sites

while the other is not, this may not be the case. But our estimates of the energetic contributions of each type of site (Ϫ9.5 to Ϫ13.6 kJ/mol for site 1 and Ϫ13.4 kJ/mol for site 2) would remain valid.
How Do the Mutations Create a Loss of Function?
How do the mutations we have described exert their effects? Must they act directly at the binding site? Indeed, one might suppose that mutations at either position affect Ca2ϩ sensitivity, not because they affect Ca2ϩ binding, but because they affect the ability of Ca2ϩ binding to inﬂuence opening. Suppose, as suggested by Schreiber et al. (1999), that there is a Ca2ϩ-binding domain that swings as if on a hinge after Ca2ϩ binds, and in so doing promotes opening. One might then suppose that a given mutation breaks the hinge without affecting Ca2ϩ binding. Thermodynamic constraints dictate, however, that in order for Ca2ϩ binding to promote opening, the afﬁnity of the binding site must increase as the channel opens, and conversely, if a binding site’s afﬁnity increases as the channel opens, binding must promote opening. Thus, for a mutation to eliminate the effectiveness of a binding site, it must either prevent binding altogether, or prevent the change in afﬁnity that occurs at the binding site as the channel opens. Thus, binding and the transduction of binding to opening are inextricably linked, and the mutations we have described must therefore affect Ca2ϩ binding.
One might still ask, however, whether the mutations we have studied disrupt residues that actually make contact with Ca2ϩ? Our data do not rule out the possibility that some protein endogenous to the oocyte associates with mSlo to form its Ca2ϩ sensors, as is the case for the small-conductance Ca2ϩ-activated Kϩ channel, which uses constitutively associated calmodulin as its Ca2ϩ sensor (Xia et al., 1998; Wissmann et al., 2002). It is conceivable, then, that mutations at the Ca2ϩ bowl or M513 disrupt such an association. For the Ca2ϩ bowl mutations, however, there are good reasons to think this is not the case. First, these mutations remove acidic side chains that could provide the negative charge density normally associated with Ca2ϩ coordination. Second, two laboratories have found that Ca2ϩ will bind to recombinant Slo fusion proteins overexpressed and puriﬁed from bacteria, and will do so in gel overlay assays where auxiliary proteins would not likely remain associated (Bian et al., 2001; Braun and Sy, 2001). And third, as mentioned above, the Ca2ϩ-bowl mutation 897–901N inhibits this binding by approximately half (Bian et al., 2001). Thus, it seems likely that the Ca2ϩ bowl does in fact form a Ca2ϩ-binding site, although this is not directly demonstrated by our data.
The situation for the M513I mutation is less clear. Methionines are not commonly Ca2ϩ coordinators, so it may be that M513I interferes with the linkage between
187 Bao et al.

binding and opening (by linkage we mean that which causes the binding site to increase its afﬁnity as the channel opens). This could be the movement of a key atom closer to the Ca2ϩ ion in its site, as is the case with cGMP when the cyclic nucleotide–gated channel opens (Varnum et al., 1995). Or perhaps the M513I mutation inhibits an intersubunit association of intracellular domains that may occur after Ca2ϩ binds. Such an association has been shown to occur after Ca2ϩ binds to the SK channel (Schumacher et al., 2001), and M513 lies at the very end of mSlo’s seventh hydrophobic domain (S7), a region that might reasonably bury its hydrophobic side chains by dimerization, perhaps with its counterpart on a neighboring subunit, when prodded by Ca2ϩ binding.
Pursuing this idea further, M513 also lies at the very end of mSlo’s RCK domain, which spans from just after S6 to the end of S7 (Jiang et al., 2001). In the recent crystal structure of the E. coli Kϩ channel’s RCK domain (Jiang et al., 2001), the ␣G helix, where M513 would be predicted to lie, participates in a dimer interface. Thus, although the homology in this region between the E. coli Kϩ channel and mSlo is low, and the E. coli channel does not contain a methionine at the position corresponding to mSlo’s 513, by structural analogy we might still speculate that M513 is important for the formation of dimers between mSlo’s intracellular domains.
Alternatively, it could also be that M513I disrupts a Ca2ϩ-binding site formed by the RCK domain itself, since much of this domain has a structure commonly associated with ligand-binding proteins known as a Rossman fold (Branden and Tooze, 1991) and Rossman folds have been shown to form binding sites for a variety of small molecules, including ions (Lee et al., 1995). So, although M513 is not in mSlo’s predicted Rossman fold, its close proximity suggests its mutation may destabilize a Ca2ϩ-binding site formed therein (Jiang et al., 2001).
It is interesting to note that the mSlo3 channel, a Ca2ϩinsensitive mSlo homologue, contains neither a Ca2ϩ bowl nor a methionine at position 513 (Schreiber et al., 1998) and thus its lack of Ca2ϩ sensitivity is easily explained in terms of our results. Less easy to explain, however, is the observation that a channel containing the mSlo core and the mSlo3 tail, and thus one that has lost its Ca2ϩ bowl but retains M513, is in large-part Ca2ϩ insensitive (Schreiber et al., 1999; Moss and Magleby, 2001). This result could mean that there are elements of the mSlo tail besides those we have mutated that are required for the proper functioning of a binding site in the core of the channel, or conversely, that M513 interacts with a Ca2ϩ-binding site in the mSlo tail, besides the Ca2ϩ bowl, that is not present in the mSlo3 tail. Clearly, conﬁrmation of any of these hypotheses must await new physiological and structural data.
