Background: PIP2 has been reported to enhance Ca2ϩ-driven gating, but the molecular determinants of this interplay are not known. Results: PIP2 interacts with specific basic residues and enhances Ca2ϩ gating through the ␣A-KDRDD-␣B structural elements. Conclusion: The RCK1 Ca2ϩ-binding site is coupled to PIP2. Significance: PIP2 is a key element in the regulation of BK channel activity.

Big or high conductance potassium (BK) channels are activated by voltage and intracellular calcium (Ca2؉). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a ubiquitous modulator of ion channel activity, has been reported to enhance Ca2؉-driven gating of BK channels, but a molecular understanding of this interplay or even of the PIP2 regulation of this channel’s activity remains elusive. Here, we identify structural determinants in the KDRDD loop (which follows the ␣A helix in the RCK1 domain) to be responsible for the coupling between Ca2؉ and PIP2 in regulating BK channel activity. In the absence of Ca2؉, RCK1 structural elements limit channel activation through a decrease in the channel’s PIP2 apparent affinity. This inhibitory influence of BK channel activation can be relieved by mutation of residues that (a) connect either the RCK1 Ca2؉ coordination site (Asp367 or its flanking basic residues in the KDRDD loop) to the PIP2interacting residues (Lys392 and Arg393) found in the ␣B helix or (b) are involved in hydrophobic interactions between the ␣A and ␣B helix of the RCK1 domain. In the presence of Ca2؉, the RCK1-inhibitory influence of channel-PIP2 interactions and channel activity is relieved by Ca2؉ engaging Asp367. Our results demonstrate that, along with Ca2؉ and voltage, PIP2 is a third factor critical to the integral control of BK channel activity.
The high conductance potassium (Maxi K, Big K, or BK) channel is activated by both membrane depolarization and increased intracellular Ca2ϩ concentrations ([Ca2ϩ]i). Although Ca2ϩ and voltage are thought to act independently to

regulate channel opening, a weak allosteric interaction between
them makes the voltage sensor movement much more effective
(1– 4). The Slo1 pore-forming subunits of BK channels are
composed of seven transmembrane segments (S0 –S6) that
assemble into tetramers. The S1–S4 transmembrane region of the Slo1␣ subunit forms a voltage-sensing domain, as in other voltage-gated channels, whereas the large C-terminal intracellular ligand-binding domain is responsible for sensing Ca2ϩ (5–13). Association of the Slo1␣ subunit with tissue-specific two-transmembrane ␤1–␤4 subunits modifies its functional characteristics (14). The BK channel is expressed in a wide vari-
ety of tissues, most notably in the brain and smooth muscle-
containing organs, but also among other tissues in reproductive
organs (ovary, testes), in the pancreas, and in adrenal glands
(15). In humans, malfunction of the BK channel is known to be
important to the pathophysiology of epilepsy (16 –19), hyper-
tension (20 –24), cancer (25–28), and asthma (29).
The Slo1 cytosolic domain is composed of two RCK (regulator of Kϩ conductance) domains, RCK1 and RCK2 (30). The first Ca2ϩ-binding site identified was in a region termed the Ca2ϩ-bowl that contains a series of Asp residues located in
the RCK2 domain (6) (also see Fig. 1, B, C (left), and D (bottom)). The second Ca2ϩ-binding site was identified in the RCK1 domain at position Asp367 (Fig. 1, A and D (top), shows Asp367 in the KDRDD loop in yellow) (10). Subsequently, the side chain of Glu535 (Fig. 1C, right) was reported to be a part of the RCK1 Ca2ϩ coordination site together with Asp367 (31).
High-resolution crystal structures of the cytosolic domain have been obtained either with the RCK2 Ca2ϩ-bowl occupied by Ca2ϩ (PDB3 code 3MT5) (32) or in the absence of Ca2ϩ (PDB code 3NAF) (33). Ca2ϩ has not yet been resolved in the RCK1 site, although the side chains of Asp367 and Glu535 are positioned such that they could coordinate Ca2ϩ (Fig. 1C, right, 3NAF structure). Interestingly, in the presence of Ca2ϩ in the Ca2ϩ-bowl, Asp367 and Glu535 point away from each other,

such that they could not possibly coordinate Ca2ϩ (Fig. 1C, left,
3MT5 structure). Despite these structural advances in the Ca2ϩ-sensing cytosolic domains, the lack of a full-length struc-
ture that includes the transmembrane domains as well as the lack of the RCK1 Ca2ϩ-bound state have precluded a structural
understanding of how the channel is gated by either voltage or Ca2ϩ and how the weak allosteric coupling between these two
gating mechanisms greatly enhances channel activation.
Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which has been shown to activate most ion channels and transporters (34,
35), has also been reported to directly activate BK channels by a single study (36). PIP2 was found to enhance Ca2ϩ-driven gating by increasing mean open time and decreasing mean closed
time kinetics. The PIP2-induced activation was also found to be potentiated by the ␤1 but not by the ␤4 accessory channel sub-
units. These PIP2 effects were found to be relevant in vascular myocytes, possibly contributing to the BK control of vascular
tone.
We set out to investigate the structural determinants of the Ca2ϩ-dependent PIP2 regulation of Slo1␣ activity. We ex pressed the mSlo1␣ channel in Xenopus oocytes and mainly
used inside-out macropatches to study regulation of its activity by PIP2. Increases in [Ca2ϩ]i enhanced the apparent affinity for

PIP2 through the Ca2ϩ coordination residue Asp367 in the KDRDD loop. Furthermore, in the absence of [Ca2ϩ]i, it became clear that Asp367 as well as its two flanking basic residues, Lys366 and Arg368 (Fig. 1A), served to inhibit channel activation by decreasing the apparent affinity for PIP2. These results suggested that the KDRDD loop exerted an inhibitory effect on channel activation through PIP2. Mutagenesis results showed that this coupling proceeded from the KDRDD loop through the ␣A helix to the ␣B helix (Fig. 1D, top). PIP2 docking simulations with the two available crystal structures and mutagenesis identified two basic residues in the ␣B helix, Lys392 and Arg393, as critical elements in the coordination of PIP2 (Fig. 1C, right). These results suggest that PIP2 could serve in the role of allosterically coupling the cytosolic RCK1 structural elements (KDRDD loop, ␣A and ␣B helices) to the membranegating elements of the channel.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mutagenesis and Channel Expression—Mouse Slo1 (mSlo1) cDNA was a gift from the laboratory of Dr. Christopher Lingle (Washington University, St. Louis, MO), of which the vector pXMX was designed to promote expression or increase RNA stability (10, 37–39). All mutations were generated by Pfu-

based mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM kit and verified by sequencing. cRNA was transcribed using the MessageMachine kit SP6 (Ambion) and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes (0.3–5 ng/oocyte), depending on the expression level of the given channel protein. X. laevis oocytes were harvested and used for cRNA injection as described previously (40 – 42). Currents were normally recorded within ϳ2 weeks.
Electrophysiology—Macroscopic currents were recorded from standard excised inside-out patches with an A-M 2400 patch clamp amplifier (A-M Systems, Inc.). pClamp (Molecular Devices) was used to drive stimulus protocols and digitize currents. The signals were low pass-filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 20-␮s intervals. The pipette solution contained 140 mM KMES (methanesulfonate), 20 mM KOH, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.0. The composition of internal solution of 0 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i to bathe the cytoplasmic face of patch membranes contained 140 mM KMES, 20 mM KOH, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM EGTA, pH 7.0. The free [Ca2ϩ] in nominal 0 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i solution was presumably about 0.5 nM. To obtain the conductancevoltage (G-V) curves in different [Ca2ϩ]i, currents were elicited by voltage pulses from Ϫ180 to 200 mV (20 ms) at 10-mV increments, whereas the voltages before and after the pulses were held at Ϫ120 mV. In 0 [Ca2ϩ]i, currents were elicited by voltage pulses from Ϫ100 to 300 mV or to 380 mV for some mutants (8 ms) at 10-mV increments, unless otherwise mentioned, whereas the voltages before and after these pulses were held at Ϫ100 mV.
BK single-channel currents were recorded from oocytes under the standard inside-out patch configuration. The solutions in the pipette and bath were the same as used in macroscopic current recordings except that 2 mM MgCl2 and[Ca2ϩ]i concentrations were changed as indicated. Activity rundown in different intracellular [Ca2ϩ]i was measured 20 –30 min following excision at the indicated voltage. 10 ␮M PIP2 was perfused from the intracellular side (bath solution), and its effect was measured 5 min later when the BK channel activity reached steady state. Preparation of different [Ca2ϩ] solutions was as described previously (37, 43).
Whole-cell currents in Xenopus oocytes were recorded by conventional two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (40). Recordings were performed with a GeneClamp500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) 3–5 days after cRNA injection. Electrodes were filled with 1.5% (w/v) agarose in 3 M KCl. The bath was perfused with the same solution as that used in the pipette solution for inside-out patches. Microelectrodes had a resistance of 0.3–1.0 megaohms.
Wortmannin (Wtmn) treatment involved incubation of oocytes for 2–2.5 h before recording. In experiments with intact oocytes, intracellular Ca2ϩ levels were controlled by application of 2 nM ionomycin in the bath that contained different Ca2ϩ concentrations. Data acquisition and analysis were carried out using pClamp9 (Molecular Devices) and Origin (Microcal) software.
Data Analysis—The relative conductance was determined by measuring the steady-state current amplitudes at the indicated voltages. The G-V curves were fitted with the Boltzmann function,

where G/Gmax is the ratio of conductance to maximal conductance, z is the number of equivalent charges, e is the elementary charge, V is membrane potential, and V1⁄2 is the voltage where G/Gmax reaches half of the maximum. k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute temperature.
Data in all figures are expressed as mean Ϯ S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student’s t test, and p Ͻ 0.05 was considered significant.
Homology Modeling—The crystal structures of Kv1.2/2.1 (PDB code 2R9R), hSlo1 (PDB code 3MT5 for the Ca2ϩ-bowloccupied model, and 3NAF for the Ca2ϩ-bowl-free model) were used as templates to develop homology models for the mSlo1 channel. In order to build the homology model of mSlo1, we first constructed a hybrid model template composed of the Kv1.2/Kv2.1 structure and of the hSlo1 3NAF structure. The structure of the Kv1.2/Kv2.1 S1–S6 was docked onto the hSlo1 structure based on the orientation of the four BK linkers. We then used the fused crystal structure templates (Kv1.2/2.1 transmembrane domains) and mSlo1 channel (GI: 347144) for sequence alignment using the ClustalW server (44), followed by minor manual adjustments in non-homologous regions.
We also built an mSlo1 model based on the 3MT5 crystal structure of hSlo1. Because 3MT5 was crystallized as a monomer and did not contain the BK linker, we used the 2R9R-3NAF structure to construct the hybrid template of 2R9R-3MT5. The 3MT5-based homology model of mSlo1 was then built based on the hybrid template of 2R9R-3MT5. Homology models of the mSlo1 channel were generated using the MODELLER program (45).
PIP2 and Slo1 Docking—We used the AUTODOCK program (46) to dock the PIP2 headgroup into the mSlo1 model structures. The grid-based potential maps that were generated for the mSlo1 channel, using CHNOP (i.e. carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus) elements, sampled on a uniform grid containing 100 ϫ 70 ϫ 100 points, were 0.375 Å apart for the free energy calculations. The grid box was centered at the side chain of residue Arg393 of mSlo1, which was found by our functional studies to be important for PIP2 sensitivity. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used to identify the docking conformations of the PIP2 headgroup. 100 docking simulations were performed. The final docked PIP2 headgroup configurations were selected based on docked binding energies and cluster analysis. Two potential binding sites of mSlo1 channel for PIP2 were identified by docking simulations, formed by positively charged residues Lys392 and Arg393.
Chemicals— diC8 PIP2 and PIP2 antibody (PIP2 Ab) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Other chemicals, such as Wtmn, ionomycin, Mg-ATP, and polylysine (poly-Kϩ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Stocks and working solutions were prepared using protocols according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

RESULTS
Slo1 Channels Are PIP2-sensitive—Consistent with the conclusions of Vaithianathan et al. (36), we also found that Slo1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes are PIP2-sensitive. Scavenging of endogenous PIP2 with a combination of poly-Kϩ and PIP2 Ab in excised patches or treatment with micromolar concentrations of Wtmn in intact cells caused significant inhibition of Slo1 currents (Fig. 2A). Wtmn is known to block the activity of most phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases at nanomolar concentrations. 100 nM Wtmn showed no effect on BK currents (Fig. 2, Aa and Ac). In contrast, 25 ␮M wortmannin, which also blocks phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, thus reducing resynthe-

sis of PIP2 to the plasma membrane, showed strong inhibition of BK currents (Fig. 2, Ab and Ac). Moreover, direct application
of PIP2, in excised patches that had been previously treated with a combination of polylysine and PIP2 antibody to deplete endogenous PIP2, showed robust current reactivation (Fig. 2B). PIP2 altered the voltage-dependent activation kinetics of Slo1 currents. 300 ␮M PIP2 showed faster activation kinetics than 10 ␮M PIP2, especially at depolarizations to less positive potentials (Fig. 2, Ca and Cb).

showed high open probability (Po ϭ 0.88; Fig. 3, A and D) immediately after excision. Under these conditions, no significant
rundown of activity was seen, and 10 ␮M PIP2 did not enhance further channel activity. In contrast, if the patch was held at Ϫ40
mV, activity showed significant rundown, and diC8-PIP2 stimulated activity significantly in a reversible manner (Fig. 3, B and E).
This enhanced sensitivity to PIP2 of channel activity in more depolarized membranes has been described for other channels (e.g. TRPM8 (47)). In 10 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i concentrations, rundown and reversible reactivation by PIP2 were highly significant (Fig. 3, C and F). At 1 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i, we observed even stronger rundown both at ϩ40 and ϩ80 mV (data not shown). Interestingly, 10 ␮M diC8PIP2 was not enough to reactivate this channel at either ϩ40 or ϩ80 mV, suggesting again a further decrease in PIP2 sensitivity with a decrease in Ca2ϩ concentration. However, a higher diC8-
PIP2 concentration (40 ␮M) could partially reactivate BK channel activity at ϩ80 mV (data not shown). Collectively, the experiments
in Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate the PIP2 dependence of Slo1 current activation.
Ca2ϩ Binding to the Asp367 Site Enhances PIP2 Affinity—We first compared the apparent affinity of the Slo1-WT channel to PIP2 in solutions containing no added Ca2ϩ (assumed to be ϳ0.5 nM and referred to as 0 Ca2ϩ) and in the presence of 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i. In 0 Ca2ϩ, the V1⁄2 of Slo1 was 173 mV (n Ͼ 10). In contrast, in 100 ␮M Ca2ϩ, the V1⁄2 was shifted to ϳϪ7.8 mV (n Ͼ 6) (Fig. 4A). G-V relationships were constructed at different concentrations of diC8-PIP2 after inhibition with poly-Kϩ and PIP2 Ab (just as shown in Fig. 2B), and the relative conductance values at ϩ170 mV (for 0 Ca2ϩ) (Fig. 4B) or at Ϫ10 mV (for 100

␮M Ca2ϩ) (Fig. 4C) were plotted as a function of the PIP2 concentration tested (Fig. 4D). In the presence of 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i, the Slo1 channel’s apparent affinity to PIP2 increased ϳ2-fold relative to 0 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i (Fig. 4, B–D and G). Similarly, in the presence of 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i, the apparent affinity to PIP2 of an epilepsy-dyskinesia D369G mutant increased to a similar
extent as the Slo1-WT compared with that in the absence of [Ca2ϩ]i (ϳ3-fold; Fig. 4, E and G). D369G has been shown previously to increase channel activity by decreasing the flexibility of the KDRDD loop without influencing Ca2ϩ binding itself (48).
Interestingly, compared with the wild type Slo1, the D369G
mutant showed a significant enhancement in its PIP2 apparent affinity both in the absence and in the presence of Ca2ϩ (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, the D367G mutant that disrupts the Ca2ϩ binding in
the RCK1 domain also increased the apparent affinity for PIP2 (Fig. 4, F and G). As expected, increasing [Ca2ϩ]i could not further enhance the PIP2 affinity of the D367G mutant (Fig. 4, F and G) due to the absence of the local conformational change induced by Ca2ϩ binding. A similar result to the PIP2 effect on the D367G mutant was obtained from the D367A mutant. (Fig. 5, C and H). To test whether neighboring residues to Asp367 affected the PIP2 apparent affinity of the channel, additional mutants in the KDRDD
loop were tested (Fig. 5, A–H). Results showed similar increases of
PIP2 affinity by the K366N and R368N but not by the D370N and D379N mutants (Fig. 5, D–G). These results suggested that the Asp367 residue that coordinates Ca2ϩ and its two flanking basic residues (Lys366 and Arg368) are coupled to PIP2 regulation of channel activity.

KDR Mutants of the KDRDD Loop Increase Slo1 Channel Activation in the Absence of Ca2ϩ—A hallmark of BK channel function is that intracellular Ca2ϩ binding can allosterically
couple to the voltage sensor movement and enhance channel activity (1). In 300 ␮M Ca2ϩ, the V1⁄2 of Slo1 shifted by as much as 190 mV (Fig. 6A) compared with 0 [Ca2ϩ]i. As mentioned above, Ca2ϩ sensitivity in Slo1 channels is mainly conferred by two sites, the RCK2 Ca2ϩ-bowl (five consecutive Asp residues, 897–901 in mSlo1) and the RCK1 Asp367/Glu535 Ca2ϩ coordination site (see Fig. 1). Both Ca2ϩ-bowl 5D5N mutant (D897N/
D901N) and Asp367/Glu535 mutants significantly decreased the Ca2ϩ-induced shift in V1⁄2 (Fig. 6, B–D and I). However, although the 5D5N (Fig. 6B) or Glu535 mutants (e.g. E535G or E535A) did not change the V1⁄2 in the absence of Ca2ϩ (Fig. 6C), Asp367 mutants (e.g. D367G or D367A) induced significant leftward shifts of V1⁄2 in the absence of Ca2ϩ (Fig. 6D). Mutation of

the two basic residues flanking Asp367 (i.e. K366N and R368N;
see Figs. 5A and 6, top right) caused similar left shifts of the V1⁄2 in the absence of Ca2ϩ, without affecting the Ca2ϩ-induced
shift in V1⁄2 (Fig. 6, E and F). In contrast, mutants of the remaining two Asp residues of the KDRDD loop (D369N and D370N)
did not show a significant effect (Fig. 6, G and H). Summarized data for ⌬V1⁄2 compared with Slo1 WT in the presence of 300 and 0 ␮M Ca2ϩ are shown in Fig. 6, I and J. These results indi-
cated that the KDR mutants of the KDRDD loop increased PIP2 affinity (Fig. 5) and left-shifted activation of the channel in the absence of Ca2ϩ (Fig. 6, D–F and J), suggesting that these
mutants increase Slo1 activity by increasing the channel’s PIP2 affinity.

headgroup (diC1) with either of two Slo1 models. These two
models included a common homology model of the transmem-
brane domain of Slo1, using the Kv1.2/2.1 chimera (PDB code
2R9R) as a template together with each of the two available
crystal structures of the cytosolic domains of this channel in the presence and absence of Ca2ϩ (PDB code 3MT5 and 3NAF,
respectively). The C1 atom of the diC1 in each of the 100 con-
formations obtained is represented by dots in Fig. 1C. In the absence of Ca2ϩ, most of the diC1 molecules aggregated around the ␣B helix, involving the two basic residues, Lys392 and Arg393
(Figs. 1C (right) and 7A), in marked contrast to the docking simulations in the presence of Ca2ϩ bound to the Ca2ϩ-bowl
(Fig. 1C, left). Next, we tested experimentally whether these two
residues are involved in PIP2 sensitivity. First, electrophysiological data showed that although both K392N and R393N mutants inhibited activation of Slo1 in the absence of Ca2ϩ (Fig.
7, B, C, and E), only the R393N mutant showed a parallel shift of V1⁄2 in the presence of Ca2ϩ (Fig. 7, C and E). Furthermore, both neutralization mutations of Lys392 and Arg393 right-shifted the
diC8-PIP2 dose-response relationships, causing a 5– 6-fold increase in the PIP2 EC50 (Fig. 7, F and G). These results could be explained by hypothesizing that the Arg393 interaction with PIP2 couples the Ca2ϩ-induced conformational change,

whereas the Lys392 residue interaction with PIP2 is independent of Ca2ϩ binding. The crystal structure and docking simulation results support this idea because Lys392 points away from the ␣B helix in the absence of Ca2ϩ, whereas Arg393 points toward the ␣B helix (Fig. 1C, right). Accordingly, Ca2ϩ binding induces a helical conformational turn of ␣B to facilitate the Arg393
interaction with PIP2 (nearly a 90° turn) but has no effect on the Lys392 orientation.
Hydrophobic Coupling of the ␣A and ␣B Helices Plays a Crit-
ical Role in the Activation of Slo1 Channels—How could
changes in the conformation of the KDRDD loop be communicated to the PIP2-interacting residues in the ␣B helix? Comparison of the 3MT5 (Asp367/Glu535 pointing away from each other; Fig. 1C, left) and 3NAF (Asp367/Glu535
pointing toward each other; Fig. 1C, right) structures reveals that in the 3MT5 structure, several residues between the ␣A and ␣B helices (␣A, Val356, Leu360, Lys361, and Leu364; ␣B, Phe391 and Phe395) form predominantly hydrophobic inter-
actions (Figs. 1C and 8, top, right inset). Mutants of these residues were tested for their involvement in (a) the [Ca2ϩ]iinduced shift in V1⁄2 and (b) the effect on channel activation in the absence of [Ca2ϩ]i. Whereas the V356A mutant showed no significant changes on either of the two effects (Fig. 8, A,

G, and H), the L360A mutant significantly affected only the Ca2ϩ-induced shift in V1⁄2 (Fig. 8, B, G, and H). In contrast, the K361N significantly left-shifted only the channel’s activation in the absence of [Ca2ϩ]i (Fig. 8, C, G, and H). Ala mutations of the remaining three hydrophobic residues, Leu364, Phe391, and Phe395, all significantly affected both
effects (Fig. 8, D–H). Interestingly, F395A, unlike the other
mutants, exhibited a greater inhibition on the channel’s activation in the absence of [Ca2ϩ]i (Fig. 8, F and H). Thus, mutation of hydrophobic residues whose side chains point toward the crevice between ␣A and ␣B enabled the Ca2ϩ-de-
pendent effect.
Mutants of all four residues that significantly altered Slo1 activation in the absence of Ca2ϩ (␣A, K361N and L364A; ␣B,
F391A and F395A) also enhanced the apparent affinity for PIP2 (Fig. 9, A–F). The enhancement of the PIP2 apparent affinity was smallest for F395A (Fig. 9, D–F). This residue was the only
one that stood out from the otherwise perfect correlation
between inhibitory effects of residues on the channel’s activation in the absence of Ca2ϩ and their inhibitory effects on PIP2 apparent affinity. Examination of our modeled structure of the full-length Slo1 channel that incorporated the 3NAF (Ca2ϩfree) crystal structure suggests that Phe395 may come in close

proximity to the Tyr336 residue in the C-linker that immedi-
ately follows the S6 helix (Fig. 1C). Thus, it is possible that the
F395A mutation affected the stability of the channel’s open
state in a manner that extended beyond its effect on PIP2 sensitivity. These results revealed that mostly hydrophobic interactions between the ␣A and ␣B helices decreased PIP2 affinity, suggesting that the coupling between the KDRDD loop and the
PIP2 interaction residues is mediated through specific interactions in these two helices.
Mutants with Decreased Apparent Affinity to PIP2 Exhibit Increased Current Rundown—Membrane patch excision of
channels in ATP-free solutions frequently results in current
rundown that can be reversed by application of PIP2 (e.g. (49). However, for channels with high affinity for PIP2, current rundown can be minimal or none. Slo1 excised inside-out patches in 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i display minimal current rundown (see single channel data shown in Fig. 3), probably due to their high affinity for PIP2 (apparent affinity for diC8-PIP2 is ϳ6 ␮M; see Fig. 4G). In contrast, the K392N and R393N mutants that decreased the channel’s apparent affinity for PIP2 ϳ6 –7-fold caused significant current rundown (Fig. 10, A–H), whereas channel activa-
tion and deactivation rates were significantly slowed down
(data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we examined the molecular determinants of the coupled relationship between Ca2ϩ and PIP2 in enhancing Slo1 activity. We found that Ca2ϩ relieved a KDRDD loop inhibitory
influence on channel activation by increasing the apparent
affinity to PIP2. Neutralization mutations of three KDRDD loop residues, Lys366, Asp367, or Arg368, also relieved this inhibition in the absence of Ca2ϩ by enhancing the channel’s apparent
affinity to PIP2. But where did PIP2 act on the channel, and how did the KDRDD communicate with PIP2? Docking simulations of PIP2 with models of mouse Slo1 channels (based on crystal structures of the human Slo1 cytosolic domain and the rat Kv1.2/2.1 chimera transmembrane domain) identified Lys392 and Arg393 in the ␣B helix as putative PIP2-interacting residues. Neutralization mutations of these two residues decreased PIP2 sensitivity and also the channel activation in the absence of Ca2ϩ. Interestingly, Arg393, which points toward the ␣A helix, also decreased channel activation in the presence of 300 ␮M Ca2ϩ, whereas Lys392, which points toward the membrane, did
not (Fig. 7). This result prompted us further to examine resi-

dues that enabled communication between the ␣A and ␣B hel-
ices. The two available structures of the cytosolic domains
reveal a large conformational change in the structural element of ␣A-KDRDD-␣B from the RCK2 Ca2ϩ-occupied site (3MT5) to the RCK1 site that could potentially be occupied by Ca2ϩ (3NAF). Mutation of four residues, two from the ␣A helix (K361N and L364A) and two from the ␣B helix (F391A and F395A), all affected channel activation in the absence of Ca2ϩ
with a concomitant effect on the apparent affinity to PIP2. With the exception of F395A, all other mutants decreased channel activation in the absence of Ca2ϩ (Fig. 8H). Phe395 seems to come close to Tyr336 (located immediately following the S6
gate), a potential interaction that may influence the response
beyond the effects of this residue in its communication with the ␣A helix. The Hill slopes of the PIP2 dose-response curves were typically less than 1. For Kir channels, the Hill slopes are around
1–2, suggesting that at least 1–2 PIP2 molecules are required for channel opening. Values less than 1 could signify negative
cooperativity among subunits for channel opening. Alterna-
tively, they may signify more than one PIP2 interaction site with

similar affinities. The latter interpretation is consistent with
our docking simulations of PIP2 to the two available crystal structures, which suggest state-dependent interaction modes
for PIP2. Our results have provided compelling evidence that when
Ca2ϩ is bound to the Ca2ϩ-bowl and Ca2ϩ coordination at the RCK1 site is absent, the ␣A and ␣B helices are tightly coupled to exert an inhibitory effect on channel PIP2 interactions. Ca2ϩ binding to the RCK1 site (or mutations that serve to “uncouple”
the two helices) seems to relieve the RCK1-mediated decrease

in PIP2 affinity and to enhance channel activation. Consideration of the two available structures (3NAF and 3MT5) suggests that simultaneous Ca2ϩ binding to both RCK1 and RCK2 sites
may not be possible. Our data suggested that ablation of either the Ca2ϩ-bowl site (5D5N mutant) or the RCK1 E535 coordination site, either of which decreases Ca2ϩ sensitivity, did not alter the RCK1 site inhibitory effect on activation of the Slo1␣ channel in the absence of Ca2ϩ (Fig. 6, B, C, and J). Only mutations in the ␣A-KDRDD-␣B structural elements removed the
inhibitory effect on channel activity and enhanced PIP2 sensi-

tivity and activation of the Slo1 channel in the absence of Ca2ϩ. These results strongly argue that it is not Ca2ϩ binding per se
but rather the KDR residue conformations within the KDRDD loop that control channel activation in the absence of Ca2ϩ by decreasing PIP2 sensitivity. Ca2ϩ binding to Asp367 serves to relieve this inhibitory effect.
The ␤1 but not the ␤4 accessory channel subunits have been
reported to potentiate PIP2-induced activation of BK channels (36). Using double mutant cycle analysis, the ␤2 subunit was found to enhance the Ca2ϩ sensitivity of the Slo1␣ pore-forming subunit by directly coupling its Glu44 and Asp45 residues, located just before the first ␤2 transmembrane domain, with the Lys392 and Arg393 residues of the ␣B helix of Slo1 (50). Because we found that Lys392 and Arg393 are critical residues for
PIP2 sensitivity, it remains to be examined whether the ␤2-mediated enhancement of Slo1 currents is a reflection of altering
channel-PIP2 interactions. Similarly, whether the ␤1 potentiation of PIP2-induced activation involves the same ␣B residues remains to be tested.
Our study focused on the relationship of Ca2ϩ and PIP2 sensitivity for Slo1 channel activation. We did not investigate
channel residues that may also affect sensitivity to PIP2 but are

not part of the ␣B helix. Could such residues be specifically coupled to gating by voltage? Recent work from different laboratories, including ours, has shown that Kv1.2 channels utilize the S4-S5 linker and the N terminus to couple the movement of the voltage sensor to PIP2 (51, 52). Thus, the relationship of PIP2 and voltage-dependent gating in Slo1␣ channels remains an open question to pursue.
A recent report examining PIP2 sensitivity of Kv channels in intact cells showed that voltage-gated channels other than Kv7 channels would not respond to a number of manipulations that decreased PIP2 (53). However, experiments from other studies from excised patches have shown that some of the same channels are sensitive to PIP2 (see Ref. 53 for discussion). Unlike most Kv channels tested, Kv1.2 and Shaker channels have been shown to be PIP2-sensitive in both intact cells and excised patches (51–54). Several reasons for the differences in PIP2 sensitivity seen between intact cells and excised patches have been considered (53), yet the relevant question is what is the physiological purpose of a high affinity interaction of a given channel with PIP2, if it is not that PIP2 depletion serves as a signal to inhibit channel activity? Slo1 channels are highly sensitive to PIP2. Our studies using dose-response curves with the soluble

Coupling of Ca2؉ and PIP2 Sites Controls BK Channel Activity

diC8-PIP2 following endogenous PIP2 depletion by scavengers suggest a Slo1a EC50 of ϳ14 ␮M in the absence of [Ca2ϩ]i versus an EC50 of ϳ6 ␮M in 100 ␮M [Ca2ϩ]i (Fig. 4). The Slo3 channel has shown even higher PIP2 sensitivity (EC50 ϳ2.5 ␮M) (40). As has been shown for certain channels (55), the length of the acyl chain may also contribute to the apparent affinity of Slo1 channels to PIP2, making diC8 PIP2 assessments of apparent affinity less meaningful (36). Regardless of what the apparent affinity of Slo1 channels is to the native PIP2, it is clear that upon patch excision, the currents do not run down as they would for Kir channels with comparable apparent affinity for PIP2 (e.g. Kir2.1 with a diC8-PIP2 EC50 of ϳ2–3 ␮M). Our study has shown that the strong apparent affinity of the Slo1␣ channel to PIP2 can be utilized in gating the channel by coupling the structural elements ␣A-KDRDD-␣B and decreasing the apparent affinity of the channel for PIP2 (EC50 from ϳ2 ␮M in the D367G mutant to ϳ14 ␮M in the WT).
