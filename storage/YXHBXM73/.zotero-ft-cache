ABSTRACT: Nanopores and nanochannels are ubiquitous, from biological systems to various artiﬁcial materials. Taking advantage of size conﬁnement and tailoring the interior components, numerous functions can be achieved such as selectivity, gating, rectiﬁcation, and so on, which result from diverse interactions between ion/molecule and nanopore/nanochannel. In this Perspective, on account of the summarized critical principles, namely size/shape, wettability, charge, recognition, and other interactions during ion/molecule transportation in nanopores and nanochannels, we introduce four main sections of applications: selective transportation in separation, controllable gating systems, energy conversion devices, and sensors. In addition, some typical challenges and possible future research endeavors in the related ﬁelds will also be discussed.
■ INTRODUCTION
Nanopores and nanochannels are universal structures and play critical roles in both biological systems and artiﬁcial materials.1−7 It is well known that ion/molecule transportation in living systems such as retinal, neural, muscular, and so forth is crucial for the vital activities.8 Biological nanochannels such as ion channels, water channels, and glucose channels can eﬀectively regulate ion/molecule transportation across the cell membrane based on their unique shape and the interfacial protein.9,10 Taking inspiration from biological nanochannels in cell membranes, biomimetic artiﬁcial nanopores and nanochannels can be constructed to transport ions and molecules directionally by modulating the interfacial interactions. These artiﬁcial materials can be concisely summarized as shown in Figure 1a according to their diverse structural features in diﬀerent dimensions. In three-dimensional (3D) systems, nanochannels are found in interconnected porous ﬁbers,11 anodic aluminum oxides,12 titanium dioxide nanotube arrays,13 silicon nanowire arrays,14 aggregation of nanoparticles,15 and so forth.16 In contrast, two-dimensional (2D) systems are usually formed by stacking layered 2D materials like graphene17 and polymeric carbon nitride.18 At the same time, quasi-2D nanochannels can also be found in patterned surfaces.19,20 Biomimetic one-dimensional (1D) nanochannels are widely reported, such as polymer nanochannels,21 carbon nanotubes,22,23 boron nitride nanotubes,24 silicon nanochannels,25 nanopores,26 and so on. Meanwhile, zero-dimen-

sional (0D) systems refer to porous particles for which channels form within them, like porous polymer particles,27,28 silica hollow spheres,29 zeolite,30,31 metal−organic frameworks,32 carbon nanohemispheres,33 etc.34 Owing to their universal existence and broad applications both in nature and in artiﬁcial functional materials, researchers have devoted extensive attention to this ﬁeld.35,36 To further improve the function of artiﬁcial materials in diﬀerent dimensions, one of the key studies should address critical principles of ion/ molecule transportation in nanopores and nanochannels with an eye to their potential applications.
Summarizing various ion/molecule transportation phenomena in artiﬁcial nanopore/nanochannel materials of diﬀerent dimensions, the critical principles can be brieﬂy introduced as shown in Figure 1b, namely physical factors of size and shape and chemical factors of wettability, charge (Debye layer), host−guest recognition, and other interactions. First, size and shape are the most critical physical features of nanopore/ nanochannel systems that can eﬀectively separate ions and molecules with diﬀerent diameters, ranging from angstroms to nanometers.37−40 Potential applications considering this principle can be extended to selective transportation of ions in the ﬁeld of ion sieving and eﬀective separation of gases, miscible liquids, or emulsions. With decreasing size, the interfacial wettability within nanopores and nanochannels will play a signiﬁcant role in controllable transportation of various molecules.41 It was reported that when the distance between two hydrophobic plates is narrower than 100 nm, water density would be essentially the same as that of the bulk vapor, which means that liquid water cannot ﬂow through this area.42 In this case, based on surface modiﬁcation or external stimulation to adjust the interfacial wettability, controllable transportation of ions and molecules in hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanopores and nanochannels can be successfully achieved. Further applications based on this principle were widely reported, such as stimuli-responsive smart devices43 ansd directional transportation of gases or liquids.11,44,45 Furthermore, the charge inﬂuence related to the Debye layer is one of the main factors in ion rectiﬁcation, which is the crucial principle mainly in applications concerning energy conversion devices.46 In channels narrower than the Debye length of the electrolyte, the surface charges on the inner walls repel ions of the same charge and attract the counterions. Such unipolar ionic transport can

Figure 1. Critical principles in nanopores and nanochannels for ion/molecule transportation summarized from diﬀerent dimensions and the brief introduction of applications. (a) Nanopore/nanochannel systems are universal from diﬀerent dimensions such as three-dimensional (3D) interconnected nanochannels, two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels formed by stacked laminar sheets, one-dimensional (1D) single nanochannels and zero-dimensional (0D) porous particles. (b) Based on these typical physical models of diﬀerent dimensions, the critical principle of nanopore/ nanochannel systems can be concisely summarized as size/shape, wettability, charge (Debye layer), recognition, and other interactions. (c) Applications based on these critical principles can be extended into four typical categories: selective transportation of ions and molecules in separation, controllable gating, clean energy conversion, and ultrasensitive sensing.

be applied in energy conversion of various energy resources such as salinity, pressure, light, and so on.25,47,48 In addition, host−guest recognition is another typical principle which is widely used in sensors to identify speciﬁc species. Ultrasensitive sensors for DNA sequencing based on the resistive pulse technique and controllable multigating are widely reported.49−55 Last but not least, other interactions such as hydrogen bonds, π−π interactions, van der Waals forces, coordination, and so on also play intriguing roles during ion/ molecule transportation. Eﬀective selective transportation of speciﬁc ions or molecules can be achieved based on diﬀerent interactions between ions and molecules and interfacial molecules within nanopores and nanochannels, which is one of the key factors in ion sieving and separation of miscible mixtures. Based on these principles, there are broad applications of nanopore/nanochannel systems, such as wastewater treatment, seawater desalination, ion sieving, realtime separation, controlled drug delivery, nanoﬂuidic logic devices, salinity-gradient-based power generation, pressuredriven energy conversion, DNA sequencing, environmental monitoring, wearable devices, clinical applications, and so forth, which can be concisely presented based on the integration of multiple critical principles as shown in Figure 1c, and this can provide more ﬂexible approaches for building functional devices.41
In this Perspective, a brief overview of the state-of-the-art achievements and potential applications based on the critical principles of ion/molecule transportation within nanopore/ nanochannel systems will be presented. There are mainly four sections related to nanopore/nanochannel-based applications: selective transportation of ions and molecules and the related ﬁeld of separation; ion/molecule controllable gating systems with single-, dual-, and multi-state responses; ion rectiﬁcation

applied in clean energy conversion systems introduced from 1D, 2D, 3D, to composite structures; and a brief introduction of sensing in sequencing and detection. Herein, a personal view on challenges and suggestions for future developments related to nanopore/nanochannel systems will be discussed at the end of each section. We will also oﬀer a concise summary and a brief outlook at the end of this Perspective.
■ SELECTIVE TRANSPORTATION OF IONS AND MOLECULES IN SEPARATION
With the development of green chemistry and in consideration of the freshwater crisis, the separation of ions and molecules is of great signiﬁcance. In this case, nanopore/nanochannel systems show advantages in controllable transport of ions and molecules concerning the critical principles of size and shape, wettability, or other interfacial interactions, which can be successfully applied in separation of various systems. For example, by controlling the interfacial wettability within nanopores and nanochannels, speciﬁc molecules can be precisely controlled to pass through the membrane.58 On the other hand, molecules or ions with diﬀerent diameters can be either trapped in or ﬁltered through the nanopores and nanochannels based on their unique size and shape features, which can also achieve selective transportation.
Previously, a detailed study on separation of immiscible liquids on nanoporous titanium dioxide ﬁbers with precisely manipulated surface wettability was reported.14 When the surface tension of the nanoporous membrane is manipulated between the intrinsic wetting thresholds of two immiscible liquids, successful separation can be achieved owing to its superlyophilic behavior for one liquid and superlyophobic behavior for the other. Besides the eﬀective separation of liquids by manipulating the wettability of nanopores and

nanochannels, demulsiﬁcation can be achieved by further
reducing the pore or channel size, which proved to be critical
for separation of emulsions. An ultrathin single-wall carbon nanotube was prepared by a vacuum-ﬁltering method.59 The free-standing ﬁlm can eﬀectively separate both surfactant-
stabilized and surfactant-free water-in-oil emulsions with ultrafast ﬂux compared with the commercial ﬁltration
membranes. Another intriguing example showed that the
wettability can be adjusted by using pre-infused liquids for the
separation of immiscible multi-phase liquids. A porous TiO2/ SiO2 composite nanoﬁbrous membrane with pre-infused organic or aqueous solution was prepared as shown in Figure 2a.11 Further simulation results with density functional theory
revealed that the selective transportation of water, nitromethane, and cyclohexane resulted from the diﬀerent binding
energies between the interfacial hydroxyl groups of the TiO2/ SiO2 composite porous nanoﬁbrous membrane and the liquid molecules. In other words, the composite membrane with
hydroxyl groups within the nanochannels pre-infused by one
kind of liquid allows the liquid with higher polarity to pass
through but stops the liquid with lower polarity from
penetrating. Besides the separation of immiscible liquids,
separation of immiscible mixtures consisting of liquids and
gases with a capillary-stabilized liquid-infused gating mechanism was also reported, as shown in Figure 2b.45 By manipulating the pressure, controllable separation of an air− water−oil mixture was achieved. This integration, with
sustained antifouling behavior, can dynamically modulate the behavior of the liquid and gas in a microﬂuidic device, which is expected to be useful in macro-scale ﬂuidic systems.
Besides, by modulating the interior wettability of nanopore/
nanochannel systems, selective gas or liquid transport can be achieved, which is signiﬁcant in interfacial chemical reactions. For example, with hydrophobic modiﬁcation of nanopores and
nanochannels, gases can be transferred from one side to

another, while water will be stopped from permeating. This method oﬀers an eﬀective way to provide gas from one side of a three-phase interfacial reaction site for gas-involved catalytic reactions. Recently, a glucose oxidase embedded hydrophobic nanochannel reactor supported by porous anodic alumina was reported.44 By adjusting the interfacial wettability of 3D nanochannels to create hydrophobic anodic alumina, selective transportation of oxygen molecules could be achieved which eﬀectively enhanced the three-phase catalytic eﬃciency. With controlled wettability and gas transportation, the catalytic eﬃciency of the glucose oxidase is improved up to 80-fold compared with the traditional method, which oﬀers oxygen from solutions.
It is a challenge in renewable energy related to biomass and water crises like desalination to separate miscible mixtures such as ions and molecules.60−62 For example, separation of oleﬁn and paraﬃn is challenging, owing to the similarities in their physicochemical properties. Recently, a post-synthetic ligand exchange of 2-methylimidazole with 2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) membrane was proposed, as shown in Figure 2c.63 The separation productivity was improved, approaching 780 × 10−10 mol m−2 s−1 Pa−1 for propylene and propane, which is 4 times that of the as-synthesized ZIF-8 membrane with the counter-diﬀusion method. Furthermore, cross-lined ferritin membrane was prepared with protein-surrounded nanochannels, and eﬀective separation of protoporphyrin was achieved, as shown in Figure 2d.15 Recently, hydrophilic−hydrophobic heterostructured nanoporous polymer particles were synthesized by emulsion interfacial polymerization.27 By switching the solvent polarity, successful separation of low-abundance glycopeptide from complex bioﬂuids can be achieved, oﬀering a promising method to separate biomolecules in complex samples. On the other hand, a stacked graphene oxide nanosheet membrane decorated by metal ions exhibits highly selective permeability

out. Another study of ultrafast ion sieving was reported based on the porous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane, as shown in Figure 2f.65 After irradiation by heavy ions and ultraviolet, nanopores with a radius of ∼0.5 nm could be obtained, which showed a high transport rate of K+.
Despite the encouraging results shown above, there are still many challenges related to nanopores and nanochannels for separation. One of the tough challenges is to create a robust nanopore/nanochannel membrane which possesses both high selectivity and ﬂux. To increase the separation selectivity of miscible liquids, one potential approach related to this critical principle is to enhance the interactions between the speciﬁc ions/molecules and nanopores/nanochannels by introducing strong interaction sites on the interfaces, such as coordinate interactions, hydrogen-bonding interactions, etc. To increase the separation ﬂux, a membrane with high porosity is preferred. In the ﬁeld of emulsion separation, besides the successful separation of water from the emulsion, it is of great signiﬁcance to further separate the surfactant from the oil/surfactant mixture. Moreover, simultaneous separation of miscible liquids during chemical reactions for practical applications is another direction for future eﬀorts. In the ﬁeld of ion sieving, the eﬀective separation of monatomic ions of similar sizes is also a signiﬁcant endeavor for future research.

Smart nanopore/nanochannel systems based on shape, charge, wettability, and so forth can be constructed after modiﬁcation
of various functional molecules. Typical responsive molecules can be categorized in terms of ﬁve aspects: (1) photo-
responsive molecules, such as photoacid molecule 8-hydroxy-
pyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate and photoalkali molecule malachite green carbinol base,68 azobenzene, spiropyran, cinnamic acid, etc.;69 (2) pH-responsive molecules, such as C-quadruplex DNA,70 polymer brush,71 etc.;56,72 (3) temperature-responsive molecules, such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide),73 block copolymer,74 etc.;75 and (4) ion-responsive molecules, such as G-quadruplex DNA,70 DNA hydrogel,76 etc.;77 and (5) molecule-responsive molecules, such as supramolecules,78 imidazole-containing polymers,79 etc.80 Based on the external
stimuli, the controllable gating nanopore/nanochannel system
can be mainly divided into the following three types: single-
stimulus-responsive nanochannels, dual-stimuli-responsive nanochannels with asymmetric modiﬁcations, and multi-state
stimuli-responsive nanochannels with tunable states. As to single-stimulus-responsive nanopores and nano-
channels, the stimuli factors can further be divided into three categories: ions like H+,71,81 K+,76 Zn2+,77 Hg2+,82 Ca2+,83 etc.; molecules like ATP,80,84 H2O2,85 proteins,86 etc.;87,88 and environments like light,89,90 voltage,43 temperature,91 etc. Previously, a biomimetic DNA motor-modiﬁed symmetric
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) nanochannel was prepared.92 With the increase of pH, this nanochannel can change

from close to open state. Laterally, another biomimetic nanochannel for K+-responsive gating with G-quadruplexmodiﬁed PET nanochannel was also prepared.93 Besides the
ion-responsive nanopores and nanochannels, to achieve
successful drug delivery in the human body, biomolecules-
triggered stimuli-responsive nanochannels are also widely needed.94 Previously, a highly eﬃcient cylindrical PET
nanopore gated by cross-lined DNA superstructures was reported.95 Further study demonstrated that it can be reopened by ATP and DNase I. An ON−OFF ratio of 103− 105 for the nanochannel with diameter around 650 nm was found, which oﬀered an eﬀective way to control the release of
drugs in the human body. In another case, chitosan-capped
drug delivery by mesoporous silica nanoparticles for cancer treatments was reported.96 The anticancer drugs can be
delivered to targeted CCL cells, where pH and lysozyme
stimuli can reopen the capped nanochannels. Moreover, dual-
compartment Janus mesoporous silica nanoparticles were
synthesized through an anisotropic island nucleation and growth method.97 The controllable release of dual drugs by
heat and near-infrared light irradiation of these porous silica
nanoparticles can be further applied in nanobiomedicine, which showed high eﬃciency to kill cancer cells.
In addition to the stimulations in liquid, stimulations from the environment are also very signiﬁcant for smart devices. A hydrophobic PET nanopore controlled by an electric ﬁeld was reported, as shown in Figure 3a.43 The fully modiﬁed hydrophobic nanopore did not respond to an electric ﬁeld,

but in contrast, a locally modiﬁed hydrophobic nanochannel can respond to the external electric ﬁeld resulting from the local vapor pockets. Recently, a magnetic gated nanoﬂuid
based on the integration of superhydrophilic nanochannels and reconﬁgurable ferroﬂuid for controlling nanoscale mass ﬂux was reported, as shown in Figure 3b.98 Due to the changeable shape of the ferroﬂuid under water, the gating could be
controlled by the competition of the magnetic force and the interfacial tension. Further investigation of the membrane’s
wettability reveals that bound water on the superhydrophilic
surface acts as a protective layer and leads to the high gating
ratio accompanied by the good stability. On the other hand, with asymmetric modiﬁcation, dual-
stimuli-responsive nanochannels can be fabricated. In this case,
the nanochannel can only be opened with the simultaneous
stimulation of both sides with various combinations of stimuli factors, such as pH/light,99 pH/voltage,100 pH/temperature,73,101−103 K+/H+,70 pH/protein,104,105 pH/ion,106,107 etc.108 One typical example is a single PET nanochannel modiﬁed with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) and
poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) with asymmetric responses to pH and temperature (Figure 3c).73 This unique property results
from the competition of pore size and interfacial wettability, and the maximum ratio is over 3.5 at the conditions of 23 °C
and pH 2.8. Another typical experiment was carried out in a cigar-shaped PET nanochannel, which is modiﬁed with acid-
driven polyvinylpyridine (PVP) and base-driven PAA molecules on two sides, as shown in Figure 3d.56

Improved further from the single- and dual-stimuliresponsive nanochannels, multi-state stimuli-responsive nanochannels with tunable switches were demonstrated. After modiﬁcation of T-/C-rich ssDNAs on alumina nanochannel arrays, the multi-state responsive states can be achieved by using Hg2+, Ag+, and pH.108 Similarly, a multi-state DNA hydrogel integrated nanochannel was reported with adjustable selective ionic transportation by regulating the modiﬁcation time (Figure 3e).76 By using this method, multi-gating states can be successfully achieved. In another study, with the extension of stimulation time or the increased concentration of carbonate, the 1-(4-amino-phenyl)-2,2,2-triﬂuoro-ethanonemodiﬁed polyimide conical nanochannel can be switched into two states with diﬀerent ﬂux rates due to the wettability and charge distribution.109 Recently, a conical PET nanochannel was reported to be modiﬁed by a supra-molecular selfassembly method. By adjusting the modiﬁcations, a reversible triple-gating states can be successfully obtained (Figure 3f).78
Despite the promising achievements, nanopore/nanochannel-based separation still faces some challenges. One typical challenge in the controllable gating nanopore/nanochannel system is to develop nanopores and nanochannels with steady responsive cycles and high durability. In the future, it is expected that smart rectiﬁcation of ions and molecules can be achieved in micro-/sub-micro-sized nanopores and nanochannels, which can oﬀer both high ﬂux and gating ratio after interfacial modiﬁcation with numerous new materials.110 Last but not least, a precisely controllable multi-gating system in energy conversion generators is also needed for further smart devices.
■ CLEAN ENERGY CONVERSION OF NANOPORE/NANOCHANNEL SYSTEMS
As the human population grows, the energy crisis becomes more and more serious. Due to the overlapping Debye layers in nanoconﬁned areas, the nanopore/nanochannel system can achieve a high ion selectivity which shows great potential in eﬃcient clean energy generation devices. The topic of clean energy conversion has been one of the most concerned questions in the past few decades due to the increase of population, environmental pollution, and serious fossil fuel crisis.111 Extensive eﬀorts have been devoted to design highly eﬃcient harvesting devices to capture clean energy such as light, salinity, heat, pressure, and so forth.112−115 Of all existing energy-harvesting devices, nanopore/nanochannel-based systems show great potential in high-eﬃciency energy conversion owing to its huge surface area and unique rectiﬁcation behavior.116−118 In this section, based on the critical principle of interfacial charge concerning Debye layer for asymmetric transmission of ions, some typical energy conversion systems will be introduced based on diﬀerent energy resources such as concentration, pressure, light, and heat. The broad application will also be discussed according to their structure feature in diﬀerent dimensions ranging from 1D, 2D, and 3D to composite systems.
For better understanding of the mechanism in energy conversion system including eﬀect of surface charge, membrane thickness, hydrodynamic slip, and so on, tremendous eﬀorts have been devoted to the 1D single nanopores and nanochannels.119 Recently, a single-layer MoS2 with a single nanopore as a nanopower generator based on a salt gradient was fabricated (Figure 4a).47 The estimated power density can reach 106 W m−2 by salt gradient resulting from the atomically

thin membrane. In another work, detailed studies on single nanochannel were performed with a boron nitride nanochannel piercing through a silicon nitride membrane connecting two ﬂuid reservoirs, as shown in Figure 4b.24 The maximum power density based on the salinity gradient for this system can reach 4 kW m−2, originating in the anomalously high surface charge carried by the nanotube’s internal surface in water at large pH. Moreover, the hydrostatic energy related to waterfall and human activities is another potential clean energy resource. When liquids ﬂow through a charged nanochannel driven by pressure gradient, the free charge of the double layer on the surface will move in the direction of the liquid ﬂow which in turn produce a streaming current and streaming potential in external circuits. On this context, the streaming current generated in an individual rectangular silica nanochannel resulting from the pressure gradient was reported as shown in Figure 4c.25 It is found the streaming current is proportional to the applied pressure and channel height. Further modeling by nonlinear Poisson− Boltzmann theory indicates that the silica surface is in saltdependent hydration state, and the maximum energy conversion is around 6% with 145 nm channel height and 10−5 M KCl aqueous solution. Furthermore, sun light is one of the huge resource of clean energy.120 Inspired by rhodopsin, a DNA-modiﬁed PET nanochannel was reported as a smart light-driven proton pump for light-current generation as shown in Figure 4d.48 With the irradiation of UV light, the 8hydroxypyrnen-1,3,6-trisulfonate (HA) molecules can generate A− and H+ gradient. Due to the unidirectional transportation of H+ ions through the nanochannel membrane, a maximum photocurrent of 6 μA m−2 can be obtained.
Although the 1D system can achieve eﬀective energy conversion, its complex preparation process and low porosity limit its prospects in practical applications. Hence, 2D nanochannel with production potential such as graphene membrane which can be fabricated by vacuum ﬁltration method came to our eyes.121 As shown in Figure 4e, a selfassembled graphene hydrogel nanoﬂuidic generator to convert hydraulic motion into ion current was prepared.122 With the large interlayer spacing around 10 nm, negatively charged surfaces and 2D capillary force, the maximum streaming current approaching 16.8 μA cm−2 bar−1 was observed. This study suggests that this device can be further applied in harvesting the hydraulic pressure from footsteps, body ﬂuid and so forth. In another case, an intriguing device for eﬀective thermo-osmotic energy conversion process was reported which is prepared by a 3D polytetraﬂuoroethylene membrane (Figure 4f).123 Owing to the hydrophobic property of this nanoporous membrane, air can be trapped within the nanochannel in liquid, and power density up to 3.5 W m−2 can be achieved with a temperature change of 40 °C between the hot and cold sources.
To further improve the conversion eﬃciency, hybridization membrane with negatively charged and positively charged part was proposed. After pre-assembly modiﬁcation, the negatively charged and positively charged graphene oxide membrane was constructed (Figure 4g).125 Further experiments revealed the interlayer distance of 2D nanochannel is around 1 nm and the output power density in NaCl solution is around 0.77 W m−2. On the other hand, an asymmetric heterojunctions between negatively charged and positively charged part was proposed which could greatly enhance the ion selectivity. On the other hand, ultrathin and ion-selective Janus membranes prepared

via the phase separation of two block copolymers were engineered, which enable osmotic energy conversion with power densities of approximately 2.04 W m−2 by mixing natural seawater and fresh water (Figure 4h).126
Besides the achievements mentioned above, some challenges in this ﬁeld are still low energy conversion eﬃciency and high costs resulting from the complex preparation processes. On the other hand, free-standing ultrathin ﬁlm is needed to obtain high ﬂux, which can in turn create high power density. Moreover, for the hydraulic pressure−current system, robust membrane is needed to endure the high pressure. Except for the mentioned three kinds of energy conversion systems, more diverse conversion systems based on nanopores and nanochannels need to be developed such as respiration, oscillation, magnetic ﬁeld, and so forth.
■ NANOPORE/NANOCHANNEL-BASED SENSING
Sensing and single-molecule sequencing are promising ﬁelds for future environmental monitoring, clinical applications, wearable devices, and so on.127,128 So far, extensive studies have proved that nanopore/nanochannel systems with conﬁned space are promising for high sensitivity and high accuracy detection and molecule sequencing.129,130 For example, bare nanopores based on resistive-pulse technique or nanopores and nanochannel based on recognition interactions of various molecules showed great advantages in DNA sequencing and speciﬁc detection of ions and molecules.131,132
Sequencing of biomolecules like DNA and proteins based on the resistive-pulse technique is already used in daily life.133,134 A membrane with a single nanopore is created connecting two electrolytic solutions. Charged molecules, such as DNA and protein, can be driven through the nanopore by the applied potential. The conductance versus time signals clearly show the diﬀerence before and after the addition of DNA. Furthermore, DNA conformations can be identiﬁed by the signature of conductance curve. Recently, a wide-type aerolysin nanopore with high resolution in discriminating polydeoxyadenines based on the geometry and electrostatic interactions was reported.135 Furthermore, the successful real-time monitor of a stepwise degradation of polydeoxyadenines was achieved based on the current levels. As to the “third generation” instruments, it is encouraging to know that a mammalian genome can be sequenced for US$1000 in 24 h.57 In another study, an AFMassisted nanopore detector of protein was reported.136 By monitoring the force and current, the composite devices can discriminate residue substitutions in protein molecules. Recently, a real-time monitoring of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide in respiration chain was reported taking advantage of asymmetric nanopore electrodes.137 Based on the asymmetric geometry, a bubble-induced transient ionic current pattern was created which showed high sensitivity of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide concentration as low as 1 pM.
Previously, a conical polyimide nanochannel by asymmetric track-etch technique was reported.82 Further immobilization of thymine-rich ssDNA showed high sensitivity to mercury ions with the current ratio over 3.6 at the concentration of Hg2+ near 8 nM. On the other hand, detection in biological system is a vital topic applied in wearable devices for human health. Based on a single conical PET nanochannel modiﬁed with glucose oxidase, the successful detection of D-glucose was achieved which can be applied for the detection in monitoring human blood.138 Successful distinction of D-glucose and L-

glucose was achieved by monitoring the ion current with various concentrations. Further experiments on the tip diameter around 30 nm showed the highest sensing capability around 2.0 with 1 nM D-glucose. Besides, a carbon dioxide detector was demonstrated with grafted imidazole-containing polymers on conical PET nanochannels mimicking olfactory sensory neurons. This sensing device can be switched between CO2-activated state to N2-closed state with ion rectiﬁcation ratio up to 23 which can be applied in monitoring of human breath.79 Another intriguing study demonstrated a nanoﬂuidic sensing device for sub-nanomolar DNA and sub-micromolar ATP with high sensitivity.139 An integrated DNA supersandwich structure was introduced to detect oligonucleotides and small molecules. The I−V curve clearly showed the diﬀerence for bare nanopore, and changes after addition of 10 fM and 1 nM target DNA. Compared with the traditional sandwich method, this super-sandwich method showed high signal gain and improved detection limit.
Some challenges in the DNA sequencing and ions and molecules detection based on nanopore/nanochannel system still lie on the in situ, fast and real-time with high accuracy. For example, high selectivity and accuracy is still a challenge in food industry owing to its complicated detection environments. For human body detection, the noninvasive and simultaneous detection with high selectivity and accuracy is also a challenge. On the other hand, beside the detection of structure, conformation and sequence based on volumeexclusion eﬀect with nanopores and nanochannels, directly observing the dynamic functional properties of single molecules are in great demand. Recently, the electrochemical conﬁnement eﬀect was proposed which may provide new insights into the sensing mechanisms for a broad range of future applications.140
■ CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE
This Perspective is devoted to exploring the critical principles of ion/molecule transportation among nanopores and nanochannel with a focus on their applications in separation, stimuli-responsive gating, energy conversion, and sensing. Taking advantage of the size/shape, interfacial wettability, and surface charges during ion/molecule transportation, successful separation of immiscible liquids, liquids/gases, and miscible mixtures in nanopore/nanochannel systems is brieﬂy introduced. Stimuli-responsive gating behaviors among nanopore and nanochannels with single, double, and multiple states are also presented, having potential applications in sustained drug release, nanoﬂuidic logic devices, etc. Considering the special ion transportation behavior of rectiﬁcation, energy conversion systems can be built to convert various kinds of energy resources, including osmotic pressure, hydraulic pressure, light, heat, and so on, which is promising with regard to the worldwide energy crisis. Further, nanopore/nanochannel-based sensing of sequence DNA or protein series and for the detection of ions or molecules is also introduced, suggesting various future clinical applications.
Despite the signiﬁcant achievements in the ﬁeld of nanopores and nanochannels in the past decades, there are still many challenges. Generally, integrated nanopores and nanochannels with multiple functions and robust membranes with reliable sustainability pose critical challenges for practical applications. A universal and comprehensive model is still needed addressing the critical principles to explain ion/ molecule transportation behavior in nanopore/nanochannel
