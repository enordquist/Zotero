A J-domain containing co-chaperone, auxilin, associates with a freshly budded clathrin-coated vesicle, or with an in vitro assembled clathrin coat, and recruits Hsc70 to its specific heavy-chain-binding site. We have determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM), at about 11 A ̊ resolution, the structure of a clathrin coat (in the D6-barrel form) with specifically bound Hsc70 and auxilin. The Hsc70 binds a previously analysed site near the C-terminus of the heavy chain, with a stoichiometry of about one per three-fold vertex. Its binding is accompa- nied by a distortion of the clathrin lattice, detected by a change in the axial ratio of the D6 barrel. We propose that when Hsc70, recruited to a position close to its target by the auxilin J-domain, splits ATP, it clamps firmly onto its heavy-chain site and locks in place a transient fluctuation. Accumulation of the local strain thus imposed at multiple vertices can then lead to disassembly.

Clathrin coats assemble as invaginating ‘pits’ and dissociate after the enclosed vesicle has pinched off from the parent membrane (Roth and Porter, 1964; Anderson et al , 1977; Kirchhausen, 2000; Brett and Traub, 2006). The ATP-dependent chaperone, Hsc70, facilitates uncoating, pro- viding the energy required to drive the clathrin assembly– disassembly cycle (Schmid et al , 1985; Greene and Eisenberg, 1990; Barouch et al , 1994). Like other members of the 70 kDa heat-shock protein family (Hsp70s), Hsc70 is an ATP-driven molecular clamp (Hartl and Hayer-Hartl, 2002). Its N-term- inal, nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) couples rounds of nucleotide hydrolysis to stages of opening and closing of its C-terminal, substrate-binding domain. The latter has a groove to receive a hydrophobic peptide and a ‘lid’ to close down over the bound peptide, after hydrolysis of ATP (Zhu et al , 1996). Hsp70s facilitate protein folding, by reducing aggre- gation and transiently stabilizing exposed, hydrophobic segments, and protein translocation, by preventing back diffusion. But how can a purely local mechanism of action drive a large-scale process like the disassembly of a clathrin coat? Clathrin coats are lattices formed by the interdigitation of trimeric assembly units (triskelions), which have extended legs radiating out from a three-fold hub (Figure 1) (Ungewickell and Branton, 1981; Smith et al , 1998; Musacchio et al , 1999). The packing of individual triskelions is sufficiently flexible that both pentagonal and hexagonal (and occasionally heptagonal) rings can form (Cheng et al , 2007); 12 (or 12 plus the number of heptagonal facets) pentagons generate a closed structure. The symmetrical, D6-barrel lattice shown in Figure 1 can be prepared in reasonably high yield (with respect to other lattices) when clathrin triskelions self-assemble together with the endocytic adaptor, AP-2, under defined conditions in vitro (Fotin et al , 2004b). The structure of such a D6 barrel has been deter- mined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) and single- particle analysis (Fotin et al , 2004b), to a resolution (about 8A ̊ ) sufficient to place a -carbons of most residues, using as guides high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of two different fragments (Ter Haar et al , 1998; Ybe et al , 1999). Each triskelion leg comprises an elongated heavy chain (1675 residues), extending from the globular ‘terminal domain’ at the N-terminus to the hub at the C-terminus, and a light chain. Except for the terminal domain and for about 75 residues at the C-terminus, the entire heavy chain consists of B 40-residues, a -helical zig-zags, in eight approximate repeats of five zig-zags each. The compliance of the zig- zags allows a leg to adapt to variable curvature at different positions in the coat. The only well-ordered part of the light chain is a 71-residue a -helix, which interacts with a portion of the heavy chain relatively close to the hub.

In the lattice, each triskelion leg (heavy chain) extends along three edges. As illustrated in Figure 1, the terminal domain, which projects inwards, connects into the first of the zig-zag repeats. The various zig-zag-repeat segments (linker, ankle, distal leg, knee, proximal leg) have acquired names mostly related to the meaning of ‘triskelion’ as ‘three-legged’. The linker runs along part of an edge. The ankle crosses with two others beneath a vertex. The distal leg spans an edge at an intermediate radius, interacting closely with the proximal leg of another triskelion just ‘above’ it. The knee bends gently at a vertex to allow the hub of the triskelion centred at that vertex to project inward. The proximal leg spans yet another edge and terminates at the three-fold hub structure, which has an inward projecting helical tripod, terminating in the only disordered segment in the entire heavy chain (residues 1630–1675). The C-terminus of the heavy chain thus faces terminal domains of three triskelions, each centred three vertices removed from the hub in question. For so elaborately interdigitated a structure, the molecular contacts are relatively modest. The most extensive interface is the one between distal and proximal legs, mentioned in the preceding paragraph. At neutral pH, assembly requires the additional stability provided by interaction with clathrin adaptors or other accessory proteins and by the tendency of many of these proteins to aggregate, thus nucleating a relatively small structure like the D6 barrel (Vigers et al , 1986; Shih et al , 1995). At pH o 6.2, assembly of triskelions into ‘cages’ is spontaneous, but the distribution of sizes is broader. Like all Hsp70 family members, Hsc70 requires a so-called J-domain containing protein to recruit it to a specific substrate (Hartl and Hayer-Hartl, 2002). The clathrin-linked J-domain protein is auxilin, a multi-domain protein that includes, in addition to C-terminal clathrin-binding and J-domain regions, a region with homology to the phospho- inositide phosphatase, PTEN (Ahle and Ungewickell, 1990; Ungewickell et al , 1995, 1997; Haynie and Ponting, 1996; Barouch et al , 1997). The timing of auxilin recruitment to a coated vesicle, immediately after budding, appears to deter- mine its prompt uncoating (Lee et al , 2006; Massol et al , 2006). In vitro , a C-terminal fragment (residues 547–910), which includes the clathrin-binding and J-domain functions, is sufficient for Hsc70- and ATP-dependent uncoating (Holstein et al , 1996). Also required for uncoating in vitro is the C-terminal segment of the heavy chain (Rapoport et al , 2008), which projects inward from the helical tripod within a funnel-like cavity defined by the three heavy-chain ankles that cross at that vertex (Figure 1B and C) (Fotin et al , 2004b). It contains a sequence (QLMLT, residues 1638–1642 in mammalian clathrin) that corresponds closely to the consensus sequence for optimal binding to the substrate groove in Hsc70 (Gragerov et al , 1994). Deletion or mutation of this short segment, or moving it closer to the triskelion hub, does not interfere with assembly, but it renders the assembled coats resistant to Hsc70, auxilin and ATP-dependent dissociation (Rapoport et al , 2008). Binding of auxilin (547–910) to in vitro -assembled, D6-barrel coats saturates at one auxilin fragment per heavy chain (Fotin et al , 2004a). A cryoEM reconstruction has shown that each terminal domain binds an auxilin fragment, which also makes contacts with two other heavy chains in the lattice (Fotin et al , 2004a). The contact surface can explain the reported competition of auxilin with ‘clathrin- box’ peptides that bind the terminal domain (Smith et al , 2004). This location for auxilin is appropriate for recruiting Hsc70 to the vicinity of the C-terminal peptide, its presump- tive local substrate. An additional consequence of adding auxilin (547–910) is a change in the overall axial ratio of the barrel-like coat (Fotin et al , 2004a). Thus, even addition of auxilin locks in a global perturbation in the clathrin lattice. We report in this paper the structure of a D6 clathrin barrel bound with Hsc70 recruited by auxilin (547–910), determined by cryoEM and single-particle analysis at 11 A ̊ resolution. The Hsc70 associates with the C-terminal segment, as anticipated, with a stoichiometry of about one per three-fold vertex, giving rise to a globular density feature. ATP hydrolysis must take place to achieve strong Hsc70 binding, consistent with the ATPase cycle described above. Distortion of the clathrin lattice, even beyond the perturbation induced by auxilin (547–910), suggests that when Hsc70 splits ATP and clamps firmly onto the heavy-chain C-terminal segment, Figure 1 Components of the clathrin uncoating process.
