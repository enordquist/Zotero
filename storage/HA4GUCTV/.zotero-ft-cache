ABSTRACT: In a previous study, we performed the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of various carbon nanotubes solvated in 8 M urea and observed a striking phenomenon of urea-induced drying of hydrophobic nanotubes, which resulted from the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotube (Das, P.; Zhou, R. H. J. Phys. Chem. B 2010, 114, 5427-5430). In this paper, we have compared ﬁve diﬀerent urea models to investigate if the above phenomenon is sensitive to the urea models used. We demonstrate through MD simulations that the drying phenomenon and its physical mechanism are qualitatively independent of the urea models. Consistent with our previous study, our current analyses with both interaction potential energy and association free energy indicate that there is a “dry state” inside the carbon nanotubes, which is caused by the urea’s preferential binding to nanotubes through stronger dispersion interactions. These results also have implications for understanding the urea-induced protein denaturation by providing further evidence of the potential existence of a “dry globule”-like transient state during protein unfolding and the “direct interaction mechanism” (whereby urea attacks protein directly, rather than disrupts water structure as a “water breaker”). In addition, our study highlights the crucial role of dispersion interaction in the selective absorption of molecules in hydrophobic nanopores and may have signiﬁcance for nanoscience and nanotechnology.

1. INTRODUCTION
Urea is a widely used protein denaturant.1 Despite extensive studies,2-19 the molecular picture of urea-induced denaturation of proteins is still a subject of considerable debate, particularly the dominant driving force and the intermediates involved in the process. Two diﬀerent mechanisms have been proposed to understand the urea-induced denaturation: an “indirect mechanism”, which comprises two aspects: urea denatures protein either through disrupting the structure of water, thus making hydrophobic groups more readily solvated,2-6 or through modifying the lifetime or strength of the hydrogen bond between water and protein;7-10 and a “direct mechanism” in which urea is presumed to aﬀect the protein structure via direct electrostatic/van der Waals (vdW) interactions with protein.11-20 It should be noted that protein denaturing via both the direct and indirect mechanisms has been emphasized by some literature as well.6,8-10,21,22
Recently, Stumpe and Grubmuller17 performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) in 8 M urea and found the urea-induced protein unfolding proceeded primarily not by active attack but by a favorable interaction of urea with transiently exposed, less-polar residues and the protein backbone, thereby impeding the hydrophobic

collapse of partially unfolded proteins toward the native state. However, another MD simulation6 of CI2 in 8 M urea showed that the ﬁrst step in unfolding was expansion of the hydrophobic core, which was solvated by water and later by urea. Similarly, Wei et al.8 also found water penetrated into the hydrophobic cores of protein HP-35 and its mutant ahead of urea, thus inducing the expansion of hydrophobic cores, which were then further solvated and stabilized through interactions with both water and urea, especially urea. They proposed that urea changed the activity of water, thus facilitating the penetration of water into the hydrophobic cores of proteins. In combination with their previous work,23 they postulated that this indirect eﬀect of urea was especially important when the hydrophobic space was too small for urea to penetrate into. In contrast, Hua et al.19 found that urea-induced denaturation of proteins was dominantly driven by stronger dispersion interaction of urea with protein than water, and urea penetrated the hydrophobic core before water, forming a “dry globule”, followed by global unfolding of

the protein. Unfortunately, the transient nature of the proposed dry globule and the complicated structure of the hydrophobic core of protein make the further investigations very diﬃcult. In a previous study,24 by using MD simulations, we have designed some model systems with the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to investigate the urea-induced denaturation of proteins and found a striking phenomenon of urea-induced drying of the hydrophobic nanotubes. However, in that study, only the CHARMM urea model25 was used, and it was unclear if the conclusions will be sensitive to diﬀerent force ﬁelds or more speciﬁcally diﬀerent urea models. There are some other urea models, such as OPLS,26,27 KBFF28 (force ﬁeld derived form Kirkwood-Buﬀ theory), and AMBER*29 urea models. The charge distributions of these urea models are quite diﬀerent (see Table 1), which result in diﬀerent electrostatic interactions. Consequently, the simulation results may diﬀer from one another with diﬀerent urea models.
In this paper, we use ﬁve diﬀerent urea models (see “Model and Methods” for details) to study the dependence of the phenomenon of urea-induced drying of hydrophobic nanotubes on the urea models. Similar to our previous study, we also use the SWNT as the prototype of the hydrophobic core of protein, because the SWNT has a similar hydrophobic environment23 and a comparable size (a few nanometers) to a protein interior.30 Therefore, even though the chemical structure of a carbon nanotube is not exactly the same as a protein interior, the simulation results from our model system would still be helpful to understand the mechanism of urea-induced denaturation of proteins. In all of the ﬁve cases, we observe the drying phenomenon for both the wide nanotube [(17, 8) SWNT] and the narrow nanotube [(6, 6) SWNT]. This strikingly drying phenomenon is attributed to the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotube. These results are consistent with our previous study.24 Thus we conclude that the phenomenon of urea-induced drying of the hydrophobic nanotubes, together with its physical mechanism, are qualitatively independent of the urea models. We also compare the drying eﬀects with diﬀerent urea models. The present study implies the existence of a dry globule-like transient state during the urea-induced denaturation

of proteins and supports the “direct interaction mechanism” whereby urea has a stronger dispersion interaction with protein than water.19 In addition, our study highlights the crucial role of dispersion interaction in the selective absorption31,32 of molecules in hydrophobic nanopore.

2. MODEL AND METHODS

To study the inﬂuence of urea models on the phenomenon of

urea-induced drying of the hydrophobic nanotubes, we have used ﬁve diﬀerent urea models: OPLS,26,27 KBFF,28 CHARMM (parameters derived from the CHARMM22 force ﬁeld25), AMBER*,29 and AMBER [parameters derived from the ﬁle

embedded in the AMBER 10 simulation package (University

of California at San Francisco)]. The OPLS and KBFF models are probably the most popular urea models,7,8,15-18,20,23,33-37

and there are some previous studies on the comparison of these two models.15,34-37 The CHARMM urea model is also widely

used to study the process and mechanism of urea-induced denaturation of proteins.9,14,19,22,38 The AMBER* urea model

has been used to study the urea-mediated dewetting between hydrophobic plates.21 The molecular structures of the ﬁve urea

models are slightly diﬀerent (the molecular structures of OPLS

and KBFF urea are identical, but they are slightly diﬀerent from

other models). However, the nonbonded parameters, especially

the charge distributions, of these models are quite diﬀerent (see

Table 1 for the nonbonded parameters of the ﬁve urea models).

Note that the OPLS and KBFF urea models use geometric

combination rules for parameters of the Lennard-Jones 6-12

potential, whereas the CHARMM, AMBER*, and AMBER urea

models use Lorentz-Bertelot combination rules.

We have prepared two systems to study the phenomenon of

urea-induced drying of SWNTs. The ﬁrst one, namely, the (17,

8) SWNT system, contains a (17, 8) SWNT with dimensions of

3.155 nm in length and 1.729 nm in diameter, solvated in 8 M aqueous urea consisting of 747 urea and 3253 TIP3P39 water

molecules (see Figure 1A). Since the edge of the (17, 8) SWNT is

irregular, only the axially central region of SWNT (2.555 nm in

length) is considered when counting water/urea molecules for

comparison. The second one, namely, the (6, 6) SWNT system,

contains a (6, 6) SWNT with dimensions of 1.35 nm in length

and 0.812 nm in diameter, solvated in 8 M aqueous urea

consisting of 225 urea and 973 TIP3P water molecules (see

Figure 3A). The (17, 8) and (6, 6) SWNTs were aligned along

the z-axis in a cubic solvation box with initial side lengths of 5.55

and 3.75 nm, respectively.

The initial coordinates of SWNTs were generated using the nanotube builder plugin of VMD software.40 The carbon atoms

of SWNTs were modeled as uncharged Lennard-Jones particles

with well

atoms at the inlet and outlet were constrained by using the position

restraint. Other carbon atoms were left free to vibrate. Carbon-

carbon bond lengths and bond angles were maintained by harmonic potentials with spring constants of 392 460 kJ mol-1 nm-2 and 527 kJ mol-1 rad-2. In addition, a weak dihedral angle potential was applied to bonded carbon atoms.41,42
All MD simulations were performed using Gromacs 4.0.743 in

an NPT (300 K, 1 atm) ensemble. The constant temperature and pressure were maintained using a v-rescale thermostat44 (with a

coupling coeﬃcient of τT = 0.5 ps) and Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling scheme45 (with a coupling coeﬃcient of τp = 5 ps),

respectively. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions. The particle-mesh Ewald method46 with a real space cutoﬀ of 1 nm was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions, whereas the vdW interactions were treated with a cutoﬀ distance of 1.2 nm. Lincs was applied to constrain all bonds. A time step of 2.0 fs was used, and data were collected every 1 ps. The simulation lengths for all systems were 100 ns.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Urea-Induced Drying for the (17, 8) SWNT System. As a first quick comparison of different urea models, we have calculated the average urea dipole moments in bulk for the five urea models under ambient conditions (300 K, 1 atm). To calculate these dipole moments, we have performed five simulations of 616 urea molecules in a cubic box using different urea models.

Each simulation length was 10 ns, with the last 9 ns collected for analysis. The dipole moment for each urea model was averaged over all of the urea molecules in the cubic box. We note that for rigid urea models this is not needed in theory, but for flexible models this method of calculation takes into account the influence of thermal fluctuations under ambient conditions on the dipole moment of urea. The resulting dipole moments are 4.77, 4.65, 4.40, 4.65, and 3.19 D, for OPLS, KBFF, CHARMM, AMBER*, and AMBER urea, respectively. These values for OPLS and KBFF urea are in good agreement with previous literature (4.9 26 and 4.65 D 28 for OPLS and KBFF urea, respectively), where the calculations of the dipole moment were based on a single urea molecule with an equilibrium geometry. For comparison, the experimental dipole moment of urea has been estimated to be 3.83 D 47 in the gas phase, 4.56 D 48 in dioxane, 4.2 D 49 in pure water, and 4.66 D 50 in the solid state. It is interesting to note

that for OPLS, KBFF, CHARMM, and AMBER* urea, although
their charge distributions are quite different, their dipole mo-
ments are very similar (the dipole moments for KBFF and
AMBER* urea are almost identical). On the other hand, even
though the two urea models can have identical dipole moments
(for KBFF and AMBER* urea), their behaviors in SWNT could
be quite different (see below). Parts B-F of Figure 1 show the number of solvent (water/
urea) molecules inside the cores of (17, 8) SWNTs in 8 M aqueous urea during the course of MD simulation, for all ﬁve urea models. Here we deﬁne a solvent molecule to be inside the
SWNT if the center of mass (COM) of it enters the SWNT. The corresponding snapshots of the urea-water mixture inside
the nanotubes, after the systems have reached equilibrium, are
also shown in the insets from an axial view. Surprisingly, in all ﬁve cases, most of the water molecules originally inside the
SWNT (the urea concentration inside the SWNT is also roughly
8 M from the initial solvation setup) are expelled from the
SWNT, and the hydrophobic cores are dominantly occupied by
the urea molecules eventually. Table 2 lists the average number of urea (ÆNureaæ) and water molecules (ÆNwateræ) in (17, 8) SWNTs with diﬀerent urea models. These numbers are averaged over
the time period wherein the systems have reached equilibrium (t g 10 ns). To quantify the drying eﬀect and facilitate direct comparison among the results obtained with diﬀerent urea models, we have calculated the “drying factor” fdrying deﬁned as follows:

where RSWNT and Rbulk are the ratio of the average number of urea to water molecules in SWNT, and that in the bulk region, respectively. A larger drying factor means a stronger drying eﬀect
induced by urea. fdrying for the (17, 8) SWNT system with diﬀerent urea models are also shown in Table 2. From strong to weak, the drying eﬀects for the ﬁve urea models are rank-ordered
as AMBER, AMBER*, CHARMM, OPLS, and KBFF. The drying eﬀects for AMBER, AMBER*, and CHARMM urea are so strong
that almost all of the water molecules initially inside the
nanotubes are expelled from the nanotubes after the systems
have reached equilibrium. Even for the KBFF urea, whose drying eﬀect is the weakest among the ﬁve urea models, it can expel most
of the water molecules from the SWNT. These results strongly
suggest that a dry globule-like state can be formed inside the SWNT,
which also imply that urea might be able to penetrate a protein
hydrophobic core ahead of water, forming some dry globule-like
intermediates during the early stages of protein denaturation.
To explain the observed urea-induced drying of SWNTs from
an energetic perspective, we computed the interaction energies of a solvent molecule in bulk (deﬁned as 1.2 nm away from any
atoms of SWNT for any atoms of the solvent) and in (17, 8)
SWNT, with the rest of the system [see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information]. Table 3 lists the diﬀerences in average
interaction energies for a solvent molecule in (17, 8) SWNT and in bulk, for all ﬁve urea models. As the solvent molecules move
from the bulk region to the (17, 8) SWNT core, both urea and
water molecules lose electrostatic interaction energies, but each urea gains more vdW interaction energy than water (about 3-4

times larger than that of water), which mainly derives from the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotube (see Table S2 in Supporting Information). Consequently, each urea gains 2.55-4.58 kcal/mol on average as it penetrates the SWNT, whereas each water loses 0.12-1.64 kcal/mol on average for the same process. It should be noted that the replacement of structurally conﬁned water molecules by larger urea molecules inside the nanotube core (on average each urea molecule can replace ∼2.5 water molecules35) is also favorable because of an overall solvent entropy gain. Thus, this interaction energy decomposition analysis shows the higher aﬃnity of urea than water to the nanotubes as a result of stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with hydrophobic nanotube.
To gain a deeper insight into the mechanism of this drying phenomenon, we have calculated the association free energy of a urea/water molecule with the carbon nanotubes by obtaining the potential of mean force (PMF) of a solvent molecule along the zaxis. The PMF of a solvent molecule i, denoted by Wi (z), is calculated by integrating the mean force acting on the solvent

molecule i along the nanotube axis (z-axis);51 i.e.,

where z0 is the reference position (taken as 2.6 nm from the geometrical center of SWNT) where the PMF is set to zero. A
total of four independent simulations (with the same system starting from diﬀerent initial conditions) were run for force
averaging, with data collected after the systems have reached
equilibrium. Below, we only present the results using the OPLS
urea model for illustration; the results for other urea models are
similar. The total PMF of a urea and a water molecule along the zaxis are shown in Figure 2A. The association free energy (deﬁned as the diﬀerence in the PMF for a solvent within SWNT vs bulk) is -0.89 kcal/mol for a urea molecule, and þ0.86 kcal/mol for a
water molecule, which indicates it is favorable for a urea molecule
to move into the carbon nanotube while unfavorable for a water molecule to do so. The diﬀerence in the association free energy

between a urea and a water molecule is approximately1.75 kcal/ mol (∼2.9 kBT). To further understand the origin of these association free energies, the total PMFs of urea and water were decomposed into solvent-solvent and solvent-SWNT interaction components, as shown in Figure 2B. In the urea case, the gain in the solvent-SWNT free energy is larger than the loss in the solvent-solvent free energy; thus overall it is favorable, while, in the water case, the gain in the solvent-SWNT free energy is not large enough to oﬀset the loss in the solventsolvent free energy, thus unfavorable. These free energy decomposition analyses further conﬁrm that the dominant driving force for the urea-induced drying is the stronger van der Waals interactions between urea and SWNT.
3.2. Urea-Induced Drying for the (6, 6) SWNT System. To investigate the influence of the diameters of nanotubes on the drying phenomenon, we also performed the simulation of the (6, 6) SWNT in 8 M aqueous urea (see Figure 3A). Parts B-F of Figure 3 show the number of urea and water molecules inside the cores of (6, 6) SWNTs as a function of simulation time, with five urea models. Remarkably, in all of the five cases, the (6, 6) SWNT is exclusively occupied by urea molecules. Even though water molecules occupy the (6, 6) SWNT initially, they can be expelled from the SWNT core within the first 4 ns. Table 4 lists the average number of solvent molecules and drying factors for the (6, 6) SWNT system with different urea models. These data were also averaged over the last 90 ns. We found that the urea-induced drying for the (6, 6) SWNT system was more remarkable compared to that for the (17, 8) SWNT system. As displayed in Table 4, the cases of OPLS and AMBER urea exhibit the weakest and the strongest drying effects, respectively, among the five cases, whereas the cases of KBFF, CHARMM, AMBER* urea exhibit similar drying effects (the drying factors fdrying are in the same order of magnitude). Compared to the results of the (17, 8) SWNT system, the drying factors fdrying for the (6, 6) SWNT

system with all of the five urea models increased dramatically (the rank order also differs slightly). This is partly due to the steric effect, since each water molecule, though tiny, still has a finite size; after certain replacements by urea, there might be no room for a single water molecule, so the urea/water number ratio RSWNT can be very large.
We also computed the interaction energies for a solvent molecule in the bulk region, and in (6, 6) SWNT, with the rest of the system (see Tables S3 and S4 in Supporting Information). Table 5 lists the diﬀerences in average interaction energies for a solvent molecule in (6, 6) SWNT vs in bulk, for all ﬁve urea models. Compared to the results of the (17, 8) system, both the loss in electrostatic interaction energies and the gain in vdW interaction energies increase, for a solvent moving from the bulk region to the SWNT core. Similar to the results of the (17, 8) system, the vdW interaction energy each urea gains is about 2-3 times larger than water gains, which mainly derives from the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotube (see Table S4 in Supporting Information). Except for the case of OPLS urea, each urea gains 2.40-6.21 kcal/mol on average as it penetrates the SWNT, whereas each water loses 1.91-4.41 kcal/ mol on average for the same process. In the case of OPLS urea, although each urea loses 1.80 kcal/mol on average as it penetrates the SWNT, each water loses more interaction energy (2.83 kcal/mol on average) for the same process. It should be noted that, although the solvent molecule which moves from the bulk region to the nanotube core loses interaction energy, it is still likely to penetrate the nanotube,41 just like the case of the OPLS urea [it is very costly in overall free energy to leave a completely empty SWNT cavity, i.e., a dewetting transition; it is very rare to observe a dewetting transition since the water contact angle (and urea contact angle) with respect to the carbon nanotube has to be larger than 90°30,52]. These results suggest that the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotube is the driving force for preferential occupancy of urea within (6, 6) SWNT too.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In a previous report24 we showed, when the carbon nanotubes were solvated in 8 M urea, urea molecules could induce the drying of hydrophobic nanotubes. In the present study, we further study this striking phenomenon with ﬁve diﬀerent urea models to investigate if the drying phenomenon is sensitive to the urea models used. Interestingly, we have observed this ureainduced drying of nanotubes for all of the ﬁve models used in this study, despite that their nonbonded parameters, especially the charge distributions, are quite diﬀerent. By decomposing the interaction energies for a urea and a water molecule into electrostatic and vdW components, we ﬁnd that, in all of the ﬁve cases, the drying phenomenon results from the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotube. Further, detailed calculations of the association free energy for solvent molecules with SWNT also indicate that the stronger dispersion interaction of urea than water with nanotubes is the predominant driving force for the urea-induced drying process. Although there are a few other urea models53-56 reported in literature, we believe our current simulations with these ﬁve commonly used urea models are representative and adequate to demonstrate the robustness of the drying phenomenon as well as its underlying physical mechanism. Thus we conclude that the phenomenon of urea-induced drying of hydrophobic nanotubes and its physical

mechanism are qualitatively independent of the urea models. Consistent with our previous studies,19,24 the present study implies the existence of a dry globule-like transient state during the urea-induced denaturation of proteins and supports the “direct interaction mechanism” whereby urea has a stronger dispersion interaction with protein than water. In addition, our study highlights the crucial role of dispersion interaction in the selective absorption31,32 of molecules in hydrophobic nanopore, which may be important for nanoscience and nanotechnology.
