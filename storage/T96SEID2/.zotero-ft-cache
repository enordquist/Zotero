Water-assisted proton transport through conﬁned spaces inﬂuences many phenomena in biomolecular and nanomaterial systems. In such cases, the water molecules that ﬂuctuate in the conﬁned pathways provide the environment and the medium for the hydrated excess proton migration via Grotthuss shuttling. However, a deﬁnitive collective variable (CV) that accurately couples the hydration and the connectivity of the proton wire with the proton translocation has remained elusive. To address this important challenge—and thus to deﬁne a quantitative paradigm for facile proton transport in conﬁned spaces—a CV is derived in this work from graph theory, which is veriﬁed to accurately describe water wire formation and breakage coupled to the proton translocation in carbon nanotubes and the Cl2/H+ antiporter protein, ClC-ec1. Signiﬁcant alterations in the conformations and thermodynamics of water wires are uncovered after introducing an excess proton into them. Large barriers in the proton translocation freeenergy proﬁles are found when water wires are deﬁned to be disconnected according to the new CV, even though the pertinent conﬁned space is still reasonably well hydrated and—by the simple measure of the mere existence of a water structure—the proton transport would have been predicted to be facile via that oversimpliﬁed measure. In this paradigm, however, the simple presence of water is not sufﬁcient for inferring proton translocation, since an excess proton itself is able to drive hydration, and additionally, the water molecules themselves must be adequately connected to facilitate any successful proton transport.

It should ﬁrst be noted that simulating the explicit process of PT through water networks exceeds the capability of traditional MD approaches, as widely used in molecular simulations, because of the challenges of modeling the charge delocalization of the excess protonic charge defect and the chemically reactive nature of the excess proton migration (18, 19). Ab initio MD, which treats the electronic structure and nuclear motion both explicitly, beneﬁts from its chemically reactive nature, but it can suffer from the shortcomings of insufﬁciently accurate, underlying electronic density functionals and inadequate statistical sampling because of its high computational cost (20). The multiscale reactive MD (MS-RMD) method (7, 21–24) (an evolution of the earlier multistate empirical valence bond, or MS-EVB, method) has proven to be capable and successful in simulating PT in a number of biomolecular systems (e.g., see refs. 25–31). MS-RMD (and MS-EVB before it) has a computational efﬁciency comparable to regular classical MD so that extensive free-energy sampling can be carried out for a PT process in large, realistic biomolecular systems.
Indeed, to date relatively few simulation studies have actually included explicit PT behavior, and even fewer experimental measurements have directly probed the PT phenomenon at a detailed molecular level. As such, much speculation has occurred on the nature of PT in conﬁned systems such as proteins. Moreover, computer simulations that can treat explicit PT have more recently shown a nontrivial coupling of the

Signiﬁcance

Proton transport (PT) plays a pivotal role in, for example, the functioning of various biomolecules such as proton exchangers, transporters, and pumps (1–3), as well as certain nanomaterials (4, 5). Stable or at least transient “water wires” are believed to be required for proton permeation through conﬁned regions in these systems by exploiting the Grotthuss proton-hopping mechanism (6–8). In Grotthuss hopping, the positive charge defect associated with the excess proton in the water structure is transported by dynamically rearranging the chemical-bonding and hydrogen-bonding topology. This process is thus a “chemical” one, involving the breaking and making of chemical bonds. For many years, PT pathways (e.g., in proteins) have been inferred from crystal structures that may show intercalated water molecules and/or from standard molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that study “water wires” in the absence of an explicit PT process. Indeed, such MD simulations have been used extensively to provide an atomistic description of water permeation and solvation in nonpolar conﬁned spaces. The presence of water alone has been commonly used (9–17) to predict possible PT pathways, but we will show that predicting PT behavior based on hydration alone in the absence of an excess proton in the water structure can be very misleading.

As ﬁrst proposed more than 200 y ago by Grotthuss, proton transport is enabled by a chemical bond-breaking and bondmaking proton-hopping mechanism through water networks or “wires,” often contained within conﬁned systems such as protein channels or nanotubes. Herein, concepts from graph theory are utilized in order to deﬁne a continuously differentiable collective variable for water wire connectivity and facile proton transport. As such, the water connectivity can be explicitly quantiﬁed via free-energy sampling to both qualitatively and quantitatively describe the thermodynamics and kinetics of water-facilitated proton transport via Grotthuss hopping—something that has been lacking since the ﬁrst conceptual identiﬁcation of this key chemical process in nature.

excess proton translocation to the water hydration of the translocation pathway via a transient and dynamic coupling mechanism (27–35). In essence, it has been found that a hydrated excess proton (hydronium-like) structure can in effect “grow” its own water wire for a subsequent PT process via Grotthuss hopping through that water wire. This occurs because the hydrogen bonding emanating from the excess proton hydronium-like structure is a stronger and longer range than normal hydrogen bonding, which can more than compensate for the loss of entropy associated with the formation of the ordered hydration structure (including in a hydrophobic pore or channel). In the majority of these simulation studies, it had appeared to be largely sufﬁcient to simply “count” or “bin” the number of hydrating water molecules in the PT pathway to account for the dynamical coupling of those water structures to the explicit excess proton being present in the water wire (i.e., the water hydration structures are distinctly different—even nonexistent—when a hydrated excess proton is not actually in the water wire). A two-dimensional (2D) free-energy sampling of the excess proton charge migration path in space, as one of the coordinates, and the degree of hydration (number of water molecules), as the second coordinate, has proven especially revealing as to the coupled nature of the charge translocation and water structures in the PT process. Moreover, rate calculations of certain PT processes on this 2D free-energy surface have proven to be largely in good agreement with experimental measurements of the proton conduction.
Yet, as can often be the case, a “smoking gun” example emerged (31) that strongly suggested that the situation is not so straightforward and that the coupling of PT to hydration requires a more precise and quantitatively powerful description. This particular example involved the ClC-ec1 Cl–/H+ antiporter protein but when NO3– and SCNÀ anions are passed through it rather than Cl–. The H+-transporting activity in these alternative anion cases is signiﬁcantly disrupted versus the wild-type Cl– limit, and the novel 2.2/1 stoichiometry between chloride and PT is also changed. However, the calculation of a 2D freeenergy surface as described earlier—in this case as a function of excess proton location and the simple hydration of the cavity between the critical E203 and E148 amino acids—provided little explanation for the coupling of the proton antiport to the hydration. Instead, it became clear that the hydration of the PT pathway was simply not enough to account for the overall behavior of the antiporter with an alternative anion ﬂux. And, upon further inspection, it became more obvious that the connectivity of the water wire hydrogen bonding—as tied also to the location of the excess proton charge defect in the water structure—was a critical feature needed to explain the data. As such, logic suggests that this more complex behavior should be a universal feature of PT processes in conﬁned spaces of proteins and in materials in general, as it certainly includes simple hydration (number of hydrating water molecules) but also goes well beyond just that measure to include structural features (connectivity) of the water wire, and all in the presence of an explicit excess proton.
Though the explicit PT process, including the PT–hydration coupling, can in principle be simulated in certain cases (27–30, 34) using a method such as MS-RMD (and perhaps direct hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics [QM/ MM] eventually), we are still lacking a proper collective variable (CV) to fully describe the hydration component, as directly coupled to the PT, which also often involves the formation and breakage of multiple hydrogen-bonded water networks. Thus, advances in computational methodology in addition to the subtle complexity of the PT processes, as described in the paragraph above, presents an opportunity to rigorously and quantitatively deﬁne a mathematical description of water wire connectivity—as an excess proton is being transported through it—which is

continuously differentiable, and thus, the CV can then be sampled along with the explicit excess proton translocation via an enhanced, free-energy–sampling approach. As such, a proper and general CV can arguably put an end to a great deal of speculation about the relationship between PT processes and internal hydration of conﬁned spaces (e.g., the various speculations and/or partial or incorrect conclusions that have been persisted for many years) largely attributable to missing or incomplete information on the actual PT process.
However, there are several challenges associated with deﬁning and identifying a CV for such a purpose. In order to ensure the continuous nature of the CV, a smooth transition in its value is required when waters are entering and leaving the conﬁned space or channel. This issue can be problematic because of the discrete nature of the number of water molecules. Moreover, the CV must be invariant to the water molecule identity and thus be unaffected by frequent exchanges of waters between conﬁned and bulk-like water, even among the waters within the channel. While systematic CV discovery methods such as the principal component analysis (36, 37), time-lagged independent component analysis (38, 39), spectral gap optimization of order parameter (40, 41), auto-encoder/decoder (42–44), Markov state model (MSM) (45), and variational approach for learning Markov processes (46, 47) all represent possible approaches for addressing this problem, each requires an input of possible useful descriptors to be linearly or nonlinearly combined into the output CVs. Identifying such descriptors can be more straightforward in some instances, for example, in protein dynamics in which the protein conformation can be well described by dihedral angles and contact maps. In contrast, the analogous approach for water network connectivity (especially when it contains an excess proton as is our present focus) is challenging, given that there are no a priori descriptors available; additionally, the smoothness and identity exchange invariance are also requirements for the input descriptors. More importantly, existing methods typically seek to identify either the largest ﬂuctuating or kinetically slowest degree of freedom but which provide no guarantee for capturing water network formation or breakage. For example, CVs representing end-toend distance or the rotation of the entire water wire can potentially be a “learned” output because they are slow motions due to conﬁnement, but they can be minimally (or not at all) related to the PT behavior.
Herein, we present two CVs derived from graph descriptions (48, 49) of water networks, namely the shortest path length [denoted as logðSÞ] and the principal curve connectivity (denoted as /). We show for contrast that logðSÞ, although directly derived from graph theory, is inherently nondifferentiable and therefore inappropriate for generating free-energy proﬁles. On the other hand, /, derived from “coarse graining” the water graph (cf. Fig. 1A), can serve as a differentiable alternative to logðSÞ and is able to drive efﬁcient free-energy sampling of water connectivity via enhanced sampling methods such as umbrella sampling (50) and metadynamics (51). In turn, the principal curve connectivity provides the long-time missing quantitative measure of the transport “capacity” of a given protonated water wire structure for excess protons in a conﬁned space such as a protein channel or a narrow nanotube. Furthermore, the free energy of forming such a structure can now be calculated from this CV and thus the facility of a PT process more readily quantiﬁed (i.e., not only speculated upon), as demonstrated in the Results section through several examples.
In this work, we demonstrate the application of / to two carbon nanotube (CNT) systems (Figs. 1B and 2B) and a ClÀ/H+ antiporter, ClC-ec1 (Fig. 3A), from the ClC family (52–56). We combined the MS-RMD method to simulate the explicit PT with the / CV applied to enhance the sampling of the transient water wire connectivity. We show that hydration itself is

generally not sufﬁcient for facile PT but, rather, PT primarily occurs when water wires are also fully connected. We further ﬁnd that excess protons substantially change the water wire conformations and thermodynamics and, consistent with earlier results, that a hydrated excess proton can sometimes create its own water wire where one did not exist before in the absence of the hydrated proton. In doing so, the excess proton can reduce the free-energy barrier for forming the water wire by ∼10 kcal/mol.

Methods

Definition of Shortest Path Length logðSÞ: We consider that each water mole-

cule is a node in a graph (Fig. 1A) and that water networks within a conﬁned

system can be fully described by the adjacency matrix of the graph

Aij ¼ Aji ¼ fðrijÞ, which represents the connectivity between node i and node j as a function of their distance rij. The switching function used in this work to approximate inﬁnity when two waters are far apart is the following:

where r0 ¼ 3 as a typical oxygen–oxygen distance of two H-bonded waters. A path on the graph is deﬁned as a collection of connected nodes and thus represents a water chain. We refer to each graph path as a microscopic path because of the atomistic details it provides. We consider that each graph path contributes to the overall connectivity between two given end points via water chains measured by the length of the path (57). The overall connectivity can thus be deﬁned in terms of the shortest path length, indicating the least “effort” required to travel via waters from one end to the other. Since the range of the shortest path length will vary several orders of magnitude because of the nonlinear functions used in Aij, we deﬁne the graph connectivity CV as logðSÞ, where S denotes the shortest path length (SI Appendix, Eq. S1).

Definition of Principal Curve Connectivity /. We consider the water wires to be ﬂuctuating around a three-dimensional (3D) curve within the channel (Fig. 1A). By representing an average of microscopic water pathways, this 3D curve describes the “macroscopic” pathway that water is able to permeate. In this way, we effectively “coarse grain” the atomistic water graph into a simpler graph consisting of a single macroscopic path; accordingly, deﬁning the graph connectivity can be simpliﬁed.
We discretize the principal curve into a string of equally separated beads fxig. A smooth water coordination number for each bead, si, is calculated to reﬂect the solvation proﬁle of the curve from a summation of all water oxygens fxIg:

Eq. 3 features a plateau when the water deviates from a path bead within d0 of distance, which allows the water wires to ﬂuctuate around the principal curve but not enough to introduce a change into the ﬁnal CV value.
Similar to the approach of using an adjacency matrix to describe an atomistic graph, we begin by deﬁning the two-body connectivity in a coarse-grained graph. First, we transform the coordination numbers into the occupancies Ii ranging from 0 to 1 using the Fermi function:

where parameters sw and r indicate the degree to which a bead along the path is occupied given its water coordination number. Two adjacent beads on the principal curve are connected when they are both occupied, and thus, two-body connectivity fi, iþ1 can be deﬁned as ðIi þ Iiþ1Þ=2. The curve is considered to be fully connected only when all pairs are connected, meaning that the curve connectivity is a logical conjunction (logical AND) of all the twobody connectivity. Based on this fact, we take the product of all fi,iþ1 to represent a smooth version of the conjunction to deﬁne the ﬁnal CV as the

The softmax function here works as a smooth version of logical disjunction (logical OR), meaning that the whole system is allowed to be passed through when any of the pathways are connected. We note that determining an analogous softmin combination of all microscopic path lengths would be computationally formidable because an atomistic water graph contains a factorial number of microscopic paths as a function of the number of waters. Accordingly, we utilize a coarse-grained graph that contains a small number ðnÞ of macroscopic paths to overcome this computational impasse.

Results
Efficient Free-Energy Sampling of Water Wire Connectivity by the Principal Curve Connectivity ϕ. We ﬁrst tested our CVs for a model system (Fig. 1B), wherein 4 ﬂexible simple point-charge waters (SPC/Fw model) (59) were sealed in a short CNT by two graphene sheets. The system was designed so that both the connected and disconnected water wires could be effectively sampled by long yet computationally affordable, unbiased MD simulations. Hence, these unbiased simulations will provide a reference potential of mean force (PMF) for any CV, speciﬁcally the logðSÞ and / CVs of interest, by directly making histograms. Among the various enhanced free-energy–sampling

methods, metadynamics is known to be a robust tool for studying various chemical and biomolecular processes. The welltempered metadynamics (WT-MTD) method, which beneﬁts from its asymptotic convergence properties, is one of the most popular variants of the original metadynamics approach (60, 61) and was employed as the enhanced sampling method herein.
Prior to running the metadynamics simulations, we noted from its deﬁnition that logðSÞ is not strictly differentiable when two or more paths are the shortest but have the same path length. In other words, logðSÞ becomes nondifferentiable when the identity of the shortest path is about to exchange to another path. Since the probability is zero for the system to visit these singularities, one may expect that nondifferentiability has only a minimal effect on the free-energy calculation. However, we found a signiﬁcant deviation of the metadynamics PMF of logðSÞ when compared to the correct one computed from an unbiased MD run (Fig. 1C). We note that the WT-MTD barrier height for connecting water wires for the logðSÞ CV is 1.5 kcal/ mol, which is 25% higher than the true (unbiased) value and exceeds statistical error. Additionally, an artiﬁcial “shoulder” appears at the position where logðSÞ ¼ 1:8, while only a smooth single well was observed in the unbiased reference. It is

therefore striking that biasing logðSÞ resulted in relatively signiﬁcant errors in such a simple system featuring only 24 permutations for four waters. Based on these ﬁndings, we eliminated the possibility of using logðSÞ in biased free-energy simulations in any real system in which the number of permutations is expected to grow factorially as a function of the number of water molecules.
In contrast, a perfectly matching PMF (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) was obtained from the WT-MTD of the / CV, which is expected for a differentiable CV. Moreover, the correct PMF for logðSÞ was obtained (Fig. 1C) by reweighting the / metadynamics data using Tiwary and Parrinello’s time-independent estimator (62). This outcome suggests that the new / CV is a differentiable CV appropriate for enhanced free-energy sampling and validates its ability to drive efﬁcient sampling of water wire connectivity.
PT and Hydration Coupling in CNTs. The next phase of our investigation involved the use of a more complicated system that was previously utilized to study PT–hydration coupling (32). Speciﬁcally, the system consists of two water slabs separated by two layers of inert graphene-like material with a 28-A˚-long, armchairtype (6, 6), single-walled CNT aligned with its z-axis going through the empty space between the two layers. The εLJ parameter for carbon was reduced to produce a hydrophobic CNT, in the sense that continuous water networks rarely exist in it. To study the proton permeation mechanism through the hydrophobic tube with quantitative accuracy, we carried out 2D umbrella sampling (2D-US) to compute the PMF of 1) the z coordinate of the excess proton CEC and 2) the water connectivity /. Fig. 2A shows the resulting 2D-PMF and the minimum free-energy path (MFEP), revealing a three-step PT mechanism. First, the hydrated excess proton is transiently trapped at the surface near the CNT mouth, as shown by Fig. 2A, Point A and Fig. 2 B, Bottom. Then, continuous water wires are spontaneously formed when the excess proton is at the mouth of the tube, as shown by the almost vertical transition A! B! C on the 2D-PMF along the / direction and in Fig. 2 B, Middle and Top. Finally, the proton permeates through the fully connected water wire (Fig. 2B, Top), following the horizontal valley on the PMF near the top. Interestingly, this free-energy trough can only be seen when the water wire is fully connected corresponding to a / of ∼0.9. This is in contrast to any horizontal slice along lower / values, which correspond to a partially connected wire and suggests that our newly deﬁned water connectivity plays a critical role for PT through even a simple nanoconﬁned water channel. Moreover, it must be emphasized that the parameters of the CNT were chosen on purpose to make it hydrophobic, so water does not favorably occupy it in the absence of the excess proton; hence, the excess proton “grows” its own water wire for facilitating its transport through the CNT, which is still an energetically uphill (activated rate) process. However, this process has a greatly reduced free-energy barrier because of the existence of the transient water wire, which facilitates the Grotthuss proton shuttling.
Similar proton-induced hydration was ﬁrst discovered in previous work (32) by biasing a different hydration CV, namely the simple water occupancy number of the CNT (also referred to earlier as the water density). Though the water density CV, which simply counts the number of waters in CNT, does not directly reﬂect connectivity, as does the present CV, it is not surprising for it to correlate well with connectivity in this simple case, because the CNT is modeled as a rigid body that permits only a single-ﬁle water wire. However, this is not the case for real protein channels and transporters and more complex materials that have other coupled molecular motions and can accommodate the formation of multiple water wires. This is where the connectivity CVs deﬁned in this work will come into play the most, as shown next.

The Connectivity CV Reveals PT-Coupled Hydration in ClC-ec1. ClCec1 is a proton antiporter (Fig. 3A) that also transports anions, such as BrÀ, IÀ, NO3À, SCNÀ, and ClÀ, with distinct H+ coupling for each anion (63–68). Electrophysiological experiments have determined in descending order the proton coupling for these anions to be the following: ClÀ, NO3À, and SCNÀ. This behavior is indicated by anion–proton stoichiometry ratios of 2.2:1 for ClÀ to 7 to 10:1 for NO3À, while showing no measurable H+ transport for SCNÀ (68). Prior simulation studies (14, 31) have shed some light on the molecular-level activity of the anion modulation mechanism of ClC-ec1 with respect to PT. It must be noted, however, that Jiang et al. (14) did not treat PT explicitly in their work and hence did not consider the inﬂuence of hydrated excess protons on the transient hydration by water wires. By contrast, Wang et al. (31) did include explicit modeling of excess protons via MS-RMD also with umbrella sampling, but, as noted earlier, their simple water density CV only provided ancillary evidence for the correlation between PT and water wire connectivity. The results also required an additional, qualitative hydrogen bond analysis of the umbrella sampling trajectories in order to better understand the underlying physical behavior. This system is thus the smoking gun example alluded to earlier that helped to motivate the search for a quantitative, paradigm-deﬁning analysis of proton-transporting water wires presented in this work.
When also sampling the water wire connectivity CV, /, along with the progress of the hydrated excess proton CEC, the theoretical developments contained herein reveal a signiﬁcantly complex hydration mechanism arising from coupling with an explicit excess proton. The PT progress from E203 to E148 is revealed from a 2D free-energy surface (PMF) calculated in these two CVs, especially as a function of the MFEP on that 2D-PMF. Fig. 3C shows the 2D-PMF of the previous work (31) for ClC-ec1 in its NO3À-antiporting state that biased the simple water density, while Fig. 3D shows the free energy of the same system with the connectivity CV, /, employed. We ﬁrst note that in contrast to Fig. 3C, which shows more uncorrelated vertical (ﬁrst) and horizontal (second) motions along the MFEP (black curves in Fig. 3 C and D), the MFEP for the case of using / features a bell curve-like shape, displaying a simultaneous increase and then decrease in the water wire connectivity / as the PT progresses, as described by the CEC position. This observation clearly shows that the water wire connectivity within the channel is strongly coupled with the excess proton transporting in the water wire (the CEC position in Fig. 3D), which is different from a “PT-occurs-after-water-wire-formation” mechanism that has often been assumed in a great deal of prior literature. The behavior shown here, which can now be clearly demonstrated and quantiﬁed by the combination of a reactive MD simulation method involving the actual (explicit) PT plus the new water wire connectivity CV, /, thus calls into question the validity of speculation on PT behavior using only water wire existence alone from crystal structures and/or from standard classical MD trajectories, the latter not including chemical reactivity (i.e., with a ﬁxed bonding topology and hence no possibility of Grotthuss proton shuttling). Likewise, the absence of a preexisting water wire in a crystal structure or a classical MD simulation does not necessarily mean that such a wire cannot transiently form as a result of a hydrated proton coming into a certain region of a molecular structure and forming its own water wire along the way.
Fig. 3E depicts the value of logðSÞ with respect to the MFEP, showing a clear anti-correlation with the one-dimensional (1D) PMF extracted along the MFEP. The other two descriptors, namely the probability of forming continuous water wires and the water wire gap length employed in prior work (31), show similar correlations (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B).

around) the transition state [smallest value of the path CV logðSÞ], as seen in Fig. 3 D and E and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B, while the simpler water number density already hits high values (∼ 4 À 5) roughly at the halfway point of the uphill part of the MFEP, as shown in Fig. 3F, conﬁrming again that PT not only requires enough hydration of the channel but also requires suitably continuous water wires.
The reaction-rate constants computed from transition state theory (TST) applied to the 2D-PMFs are summarized in Table 1. Note the good agreement with the experimental value (68) relative to the previous simulation in which only the water density CV was used, thus conﬁrming that / is a better CV for quantifying hydration changes relevant to PT. We also note that, in TST, trajectories that cross the reaction barrier are assumed not to cross it again, which is the well-known, no-recrossing assumption of TST. In practice, however, using less-than-optimal CVs for the reaction path and dividing surface can omit critical, dynamical information about the kinetic rate bottleneck, and TST will result in an overestimation of reaction rates due to the omission of recrossing effects. An optimal set of CVs and dividing surface will minimize the recrossing effects, so in that sense, the degree of recrossing may serve as a measure of the quality of a CV when describing an activated rate process of interest. Here, we therefore constructed Markov state kinetic models in the 2D CV space using the dynamic histogram analysis method (69) and computed the reaction rates with recrossing explicitly taken into account by these MSMs (see SI Appendix for details). The MSM reactionrate constants are thus lower than the TST ones, and ratio of MSM to TST deﬁnes the transmission coefﬁcient that measures how much recrossing affects the PT reaction. We show in Table 1 that the 2D-US simulation that employed the connectivity CV has a small recrossing effect, but the recrossing becomes signiﬁcant in the case of the simple water density CV, which is just the number of water molecules occupying the channel. For other anion-bound states of ClC-ec1, such as ClÀ and SCNÀ, we ﬁnd that the recrossing is consistently large when the water density was employed (SI Appendix, Table S1). As discussed earlier, our prior study (31), in which water density was employed in a 2D-PMF calculation, did not directly reveal a discernible coupling between PT and hydration (Fig. 3C). The dynamics recrossing result again highlights that water density is not an optimal choice for capturing the essential slower motions of water networks as they pertain to proton translocation, which also explains the underestimated reaction rate and low-transmission coefﬁcient in that work (Table 1).
Distinct Water Wires in ClC-ec1 Respond to Excess Protons. In order to determine how the hydrated excess proton affects water network connectivity, we performed 1D umbrella sampling of / with nonreactive classical MD in the absence of an explicit excess proton (Fig. 4A). SI Appendix, Fig. S3B also shows a representative conﬁguration of a single, connected water wire obtained from umbrella sampling, consistent with the conﬁgurations resulting from unbiased MD (Fig. 4B), thus validating that / does not introduce artifacts in biased simulations. In contrast to purely classical MD studies, water

conformations in the presence of an explicit, hydrated proton in reactive MS-RMD simulations show much “broader” water wire structures to facilitate the charge defect delocalization of the excess proton (Fig. 4C). Additionally, reactive simulations with the explicit proton revealed a new water pathway that classical simulations have failed to capture directly but which was previously suggested by crystal structure analysis (70). These signiﬁcantly distinct hydration network conformations further highlight the correlation between PT and hydration—namely that the excess proton not only delivers more solvated water into a hydrophobic channel but can also create new water wires. These ﬁndings are also consistent with the observations associated with the CNT model of this work and a prior related study (32).
The PMF for water connectivity as deﬁned by / using classical MD is shown in Fig. 4A, which has a water wire connection barrier at 13.4 ± 0.7 kcal/mol. This large barrier makes the formation of fully connected water wires without explicit protons a rare event that requires enhanced sampling to draw accurate, quantitative conclusions within affordable computational cost. In order to compare with the cases when an excess proton is free to move (hop or otherwise translocate), we decomposed the total reaction barrier of the 2D-PMF (Fig. 3D) into separate contributions from hydration and from the PT, according to the gradient theorem:

Surprisingly, when an explicit excess proton is present in the water structures, the hydration barrier drops greatly to 1.7 ± 0.8 kcal/mol, which is a few kBT at ambient conditions. The

origin of the overall free-energy barrier for the PT, therefore, comes more from the electrostatics plus chemical-bonding rearrangements of the proton translocation process in the conﬁned region and much less from the cost of forming a water wire alone. When comparing observations with and without an excess proton, the water wire between the E203 and E148 residues was actually mostly disconnected or absent when the excess proton had yet to reach this region; nonetheless, water wires naturally formed as a result of thermal ﬂuctuations during PT between the two glutamates. These results again highlight that studies based on standard, nonreactive classical MD simulations can be misleading, because both the conformations and thermodynamics of the water wires can be substantially impacted by an excess proton being in them.
Conclusions
In this work, we have proposed a measure (i.e., CV) that provides a long sought-after, fully quantitative deﬁnition of facile water wire connectivity for water-assisted PT in conﬁned spaces such as proteins and nanomaterials. We have deﬁned a differentiable CV, /, that represents water wire connectivity along a principal curve, as well as demonstrated its ability to capture PT-coupled hydration dynamics in conﬁned systems. By applying the / CV to a hydrophobic CNT and a ClÀ/H+ antiporter, and as combined with reactive MD and free-energy sampling,

we are able to identify a coupling mechanism between PT and water wire connectivity. We ﬁnd that, even when enough hydration is provided, the hydrated excess proton may often “wait” for fully connected water wires to form before transporting through hydrophobic channels in an activated process fashion. When comparing the reactive MD with classical MD, we also discovered that a hydrated excess proton can reduce the freeenergy barrier of forming continuous water wires by ∼10 kcal/ mol and can even “create” its own water network. This mathematical description of proton-transporting water wire connectivity now provides a powerful and quantitative tool for identifying and characterizing excess proton permeation and hydration-coupling behavior in conﬁned spaces such as biomolecular and nanomaterial channels.
