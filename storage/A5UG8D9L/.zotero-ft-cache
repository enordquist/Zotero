ABSTRACT: Proteins and ligands sample a conformational ensemble that governs molecular recognition, activity, and dissociation. In structure-based drug design, access to this conformational ensemble is critical to understand the balance between entropy and enthalpy in lead optimization. However, ligand conformational heterogeneity is currently severely underreported in crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank, owing in part to a lack of automated and unbiased procedures to model an ensemble of protein−ligand states into X-ray data. Here, we designed a computational method, qFit-ligand, to automatically resolve conformationally averaged ligand heterogeneity in crystal structures, and applied it to a large set of protein receptor−ligand complexes. In an analysis of the cancer related BRD4 domain, we found that up to 29% of protein crystal structures bound with drug-like molecules present evidence of unmodeled, averaged, relatively isoenergetic conformations in ligand−receptor interactions. In many retrospective cases, these alternate conformations were adventitiously exploited to guide compound design, resulting in improved potency or selectivity. Combining qFit-ligand with high-throughput screening or multitemperature crystallography could therefore augment the structure-based drug design toolbox.

■ INTRODUCTION
Ligands and their protein receptors sample an ensemble of conformations in solution. The energetic contribution of conformational entropy plays a critical role in receptor−ligand molecular recognition,1,2 but the ensemble of conformations that determines the free energy of binding, activity, and dissociation often remains poorly characterized. The majority of three-dimensional protein structures are single, static models obtained from X-ray crystallography by averaging over the unique conformations in the unit cells. Crystallographic atomic displacement parameters (ADP) quantify harmonic displacements from average atomic positions but are adversely aﬀected when unmodeled discrete alternate conformations overlap. By their nature, such static, harmonic models cannot rationalize molecular attributes that rely on dynamic, anharmonic displacements of atoms.3,4 Revealing discrete conformations5−7 that are more fully representative of the receptor−ligand conformational ensemble from X-ray electron density maps would overcome this limitation and create new opportunities to address open questions in chemical and structural biology.

For example, such models might help to provide a structural basis for on-pathway conformational intermediates in substrate binding or release detected by NMR.8,9
Additionally, an incomplete picture of receptor−ligand structural dynamics impedes structure-based drug design. While overall binding aﬃnities measured in solution report on a receptor−ligand ensemble, the structure−activity relationships are often informed by static models for further optimization, with some exceptions that incorporate ﬂexibility.10 During small-molecule optimization, even minor chemical changes can lead to apparently altered binding modes that are unforeseen due to the limitations of conventional X-ray structural models, frustrating design11,12 (Figure 1A). One hypothesis to explain how subtle modiﬁcations cause a switch to a second binding pose is that the unmodiﬁed ligand samples the second pose at low, but potentially detectable, occupancy (Figure 1B).

subtle changes in chemical structure of the ligand led to diﬀerent binding modes are abundant. Fragment optimization of CDK8 inhibitors revealed that small modiﬁcations led to a
new binding mode, which was exploited to develop potent and selective inhibitors.13 Dramatically diﬀerent binding modes as
a result of minor changes in the chemical structure of the
ligand are also illustrated by Hsp90 and PTR1 inhibitors. In
the course of structure-based optimization of Hsp90 inhibitors, Casale and co-workers observed a ﬂipped binding mode of the
ligand in the crystal structure, leading them to change the
direction of design toward a low nanomolar compound (Figure 1C).14 In PTR1, compounds that presumably could not be
accommodated by the binding site ultimately led to a boost in aﬃnity, owing to altered binding modes.14,15 In human
lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, two related ligands
(Figure 1D) that explored distinct subpockets were merged into a more potent ligand (Figure 1E).16 These selected
examples highlight both the perils of design based solely on an
initial ligand pose but also how the fortuitous discovery of
alternate poses can create new opportunities for design. It is possible that some of these “new” binding poses pre-exist as
alternative conformations at slightly higher energies than the
conformation modeled into the conventional X-ray structure.
Many of those are infrequently sampled due to high energy

diﬀerences and fall below the detection level in the maps.
However, some of these conformations may be evident in
electron density maps but at levels that are frequently ignored
in modeling. Indeed, in the phospholipase example above, the presence of
diﬀerence electron density suggested that multiple conforma-
tions might have been sampled in at least one of the smaller
ligands (Figure 1F). This view posits that degeneracies in
ligand binding modes can also be accessed by small modiﬁcations of the ligand chemical structure that shift the receptor−ligand equilibrium ensemble. This hypothesis is
supported by additional anecdotal examples, such as long time-
scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of trypsin, in
which both the ligand and receptor adopt many stable conﬁgurations.17 Experimentally, multiple conformations can be present in X-ray electron density, as in HDAC6, where
many related ligands were modeled in multiple conformations in concert with distinct conformations of the receptor.18 In
other cases where the alternate conformations have been
experimentally revealed, they have been exploited to improve aﬃnity. For example, X-ray crystallography revealed alternate
conformations for singly substituted EphB4 ligands that
inspired the creation of bis-substituted ligands with increased potency (Figure 1G).19 NMR measurements of conforma-

tional heterogeneity for ligands generated against the antibacterial target LpxC uncovered a larger cryptic envelope that was ﬁlled by larger, more potent ligands.20 Collectively, these examples suggest that multiple ligand poses are likely energetically accessible for many proteins. Fully realizing the potential of this phenomenon in structure-based design, exempliﬁed by EphB4 and LpxC inhibitors, requires reliable characterization of pre-existing conformational heterogeneity (Figure 1B) of ligand−receptor complexes.
While protein conformational heterogeneity has been automatically and systematically characterized in X-ray crystallography data,7,21−24 ligand conformational heterogeneity is less explored. Various software algorithms can identify and build ligands into electron density maps without human intervention;25−30 however, these approaches typically provide several top scoring ligand conformations at unit occupancy. While in principle the user can select multiple candidate conformations for the ﬁnal model, none of these approaches consider an ensemble of alternate conformations from the outset. Moreover, they may build unrealistic conformations that incorrectly ﬁt into the ensemble-averaged electron density.31 Despite the importance of low occupancy alternative conformations in biochemical function and ligand design, statistical measures for monitoring the ﬁt of ensemble models to data are less developed than for single conformer models.
Here, we present a new, automated approach based on qFit,22,23 called qFit-ligand, to create parsimonious multiconformer ligand models in crystallographic electron densities. We ﬁrst surveyed the PDB to investigate ligand heterogeneity in current crystal structures and selected a diverse, curated benchmark set of pharmaceutically relevant protein targets with alternate ligand conformations across a wide range of resolution and occupancy (Supporting Information, Table S1).

We found that qFit-ligand can detect alternate conformations at occupancies down to 20%, even at relatively modest resolutions of 2.0 Å. We then applied our method prospectively to all cases of the Drug Design Data Resource (D3R, drugdesigndata.org), a subset of the Twilight Database,32 and all PDB entries for the bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), revealing unmodeled alternate conformations in 29% of the cases for the latter. To evaluate the quality of our multiconformer ligands, we calculated R-factors and ligand energies relative to a single conformer ligand model. Our results indicate that qFit-ligand is a powerful, eﬃcient, and user-friendly tool to model and discover alternate ligand conformations.
■ RESULTS Creating a Benchmark Set of True Positive Ligand Alternative Conformations from the PDB. To estimate the prevalence of multiconformer ligands in crystal structures, we surveyed all 130054 PDB entries as of June 2017 that contained noncovalently bound ligands with more than 15 non-hydrogen atoms in their X-ray crystal structure. This resulted in 44620 PDB entries totaling 133724 ligands. Of those, 2611 ligands, or less than 2% (1078 unique ligand codes), distributed over 1845 PDB entries, consisted of two or more alternate conformations (Supporting Information, Materials and Methods, Figure S1). Many of these molecules are common crystallographic additives (PEG, cholesterol, etc.) or metabolites (ATP, NADPH, etc.). We therefore manually curated a true positive benchmark set of receptors of pharmaceutical interest containing multiconformer, drug-like molecules. Cases where ligands adopted entirely diﬀerent binding modes, such as ﬂipped ligands, were discarded. This resulted in 90 crystal structures that could be stably reﬁned

The local search ﬁnds possible positions and orientations of each cluster in the binding site, avoiding steric clashes with the protein. As clusters are joined, torsions and degrees of freedom are sampled. Up to ﬁve ligand conformations that best match the ligand density are selected and combined with the protein model to give a ﬁnal ligand multiconformer model. (B) Violin plot of categories at 1.60 Å

against the deposited structure factors and CIF restraints ﬁles
(Supporting Information, Table S1). We apportioned the conformational heterogeneity of ligands
in our benchmark set into four categories (Figure 2A): terminal end ﬂips, where only terminal atoms are ﬂipped/ rotated, ring ﬂips where a ring system is ﬂipped, usually by 180°, branching ligands, where a side chain or branch of a
ligand has an alternate conformation, and displaced ligands,
where all atoms are at least slightly displaced in combination with diﬀerences in their internal degrees of freedom. The
benchmark set heavily overrepresented 50/50 occupancy splits (Figure 2B), reﬂecting a historical tendency against reﬁning

occupancies in favor of reﬁning ADPs only. Inaccurate 50/50
occupancy splits do not inform on which conformation
represents the dominant binding mode, which is often critical
information for design decisions in lead optimization. Rereﬁnement with PHENIX33 substantially broadened the
distribution (Figure 2B). Unlike the occupancies, the RMSD between alternate conformations was similar after rereﬁnement
(Figure 2C). Interestingly, we observed no correlation between occupancy shift and diﬀerence in mean B-factor (Figure 2D). This result is in contrast to earlier reports,34,35 likely owing to improvements in reﬁnement software.

benchmark set while reporting on conformational heterogeneity. (A) nRMSD distributions by category of conformational heterogeneity. The nRMSD of terminal end ﬂips was determined from only atoms aﬀected by the dihedral changes. Lower nRMSD is better.

Developing the qFit-ligand Algorithm and Calibra-
tion against Synthetic Data. We designed the qFit-ligand
algorithm to iteratively explore a vast conformational space to determine a parsimonious ensemble of up to ﬁve occupancyweighted conformations that, collectively, optimally ﬁt the
electron density (Figure 3A and Supporting Information, Materials and Methods, Figure S2). Brieﬂy, qFit-ligand takes as input a reﬁned, single conformation receptor−ligand structure in PDB format, and a 2mFo − DFc density map. It ﬁrst determines rotatable bonds and rigid groups of atoms within
the ligand (Supporting Information, Materials and Methods,
Figure S2). Starting from each rigid group, qFit-ligand performs
a local, six-dimensional translational and rotational search in the rigid group’s neighborhood, selecting up to ﬁve occupancy-

weighted candidate positions that, collectively, minimize the real-space density residual of the rigid group. In subsequent steps, qFit-ligand iteratively grows the rigid group by exhaustively sampling increments of several torsion angles simultaneously while avoiding collisions with the receptor. At each step, it selects up to ﬁve occupancy-weighted conformations by again minimizing the density residual. This is repeated until all torsion angles are determined and the full ligand is built up. The maximum number of conformations generated by qFit-ligand at this stage is ﬁve times the number of rigid groups. The ﬁnal occupancy-weighted, multiconformer ensemble is selected from this pool by combining crosscorrelation, geometric, and density residual measures. The

ligand multiconformer ensemble is then combined with the receptor and reﬁned with phenix.ref ine.
We calibrated qFit-ligand on synthetic data calculated from the benchmark set at varying resolutions and occupancies (Supporting Information, Materials and Methods, Figure S3). To create starting models we deleted the alternate “B” conformation of the ligand, set the occupancy of the “A” conformation to 1.0, and rereﬁned against the deposited structure factors to reposition the “A” conformation as the only modeled conformation.
We ﬁrst determined optimal sampling parameters for qFitligand, balancing accuracy of the results and computational demands, measured by the minimum normalized RMSD (nRMSD, Supporting Information, Materials and Methods, Figure S3) between qFit-ligand generated conformations and the benchmark B conformation. RMSDs between the A and B conformers range from 0.22 to 4.86 Å across the benchmark set. nRMSD controls for this large variation by normalizing the RMSD between qFit-ligand generated conformations and the B conformer by the RMSD between A and B. nRMSD values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 0 indicating better performance. To compare performance, we report the median nRMSD of the benchmark set for diﬀerent resolutions and occupancies. Our analysis suggested that sampling two torsion angles simultaneously at 6° intervals gave the best result across resolutions and occupancies while limiting computational costs (Supporting Information, Figure S4).
Benchmarking qFit-ligand showed performance diﬀerences across category, resolution, and true occupancy. We evaluated the performance of qFit-ligand for each category of conformational heterogeneity (Figure 3B,C). At a resolution of 1.60 Å and equal occupancies for the A and B conformer, the median nRMSD is 0.11 for terminal end ﬂips, 0.18 for ring ﬂips, 0.37 for branched ligands, and 0.69 for displaced ligands (Figure 3B). Unsurprisingly, qFit-ligand performance decreased with increasing complexity of conformational heterogeneity.
The resolution dependence is more complex, however, with better performance of qFit-ligand at an intermediate resolution of 1.60 Å (Figure 3C,E). We attribute this to more sharply deﬁned density peaks at high resolutions relative to intermediate resolutions. Undersampling of conformations during ligand building can result in failure to accurately hit the density peaks at high resolution, thereby leading to suboptimal scores of electron density-based measures.
The performance of qFit-ligand is sensitive to the occupancy of the alternate conformation, indicated by an increasing median nRMSD for lower occupancies of the B conformation (Figure 3D,E). At occupancies of 0.2 and below, the alternate conformer was rarely detected at any resolution. While qFitligand samples conformations close to the alternate conformer, evidenced by favorable (low) nRMDS before ﬁnal rescoring (Supporting Information, Figure S4), selecting them at low occupancies would increase the false positive rate (data not shown).
Finally, note that the qFit-ligand multiconformer ensemble collectively explains the density best. In virtually all cases, density proﬁle contributions from all ligand conformers are required to match the experimental proﬁle. Overlapping ensemble members evaluated in isolation generally return suboptimal density ﬁtting statistics.
qFit-ligand Reidentiﬁes Low Energy Alternative Conformations in Experimental Data. Next, we applied our method to the experimental benchmark data set for cases

with resolution better than 2.20 Å (73 cases), with only the “A” conformation retained in the rereﬁned starting model (Figure 4). qFit-ligand performance with real data followed the trend we observed with simulated data: localized conformational disorder like terminal end ﬂips and ring ﬂips were determined with higher accuracy than branched or displaced disorder. In the case of terminal ends, only one or two atoms report on the distance between alternate conformations, but the nRMSD is dominated by small coordinate shifts distributed over the entire ligand. Despite a median nRMSD of 0.56 for terminal ends, the median nRMSD for only the “reporting” atoms is less than 0.30 (Figure 4A; all RMSDs reported in Supporting Information, Figure S5). Consequently, 13 out of 17 terminal end ﬂip qFit-ligand results were suﬃciently accurate to recognize the benchmark alternate conformer. Similarly, qFitligand determined ring rotations to within a median nRMSD of 0.27. However, the median nRMSD for branched cases is 0.78 and for displaced cases is 0.87. If we conservatively designate a qFit-ligand result with more than one conformation and nRMSD > 0.6 as a false positive (Supporting Information, Figure S6), the false positive rates for each category are 29% (terminal ﬂip), 14% (ring ﬂip), 67% (branching), and 85% (displaced) (see Discussion section regarding false positives).
The distribution of Rfree values of fully automated reﬁned qFit-ligand models were nearly identical to that of the single conformer ligand models (qFit-ligand x = 0.2043, single conformer x = 0.2048, p-value = 0.46, two-sided t test) and statistically indistinguishable from the deposited, manually curated multiconformers (x = 0.2038, p-value = 0.51) (Figure 4B, Supporting Information, Figure S7, Table S2). The qFitligand multiconformer models improved (worsen) Rfree in 53% (47%) of cases compared to single conformer ligand models.
The Rfree value alone is generally not suﬃciently sensitive to detect if a multiconformer model is, collectively, supported by the electron density. Therefore, as an independent validation in addition to the RSCC in the qFit-ligand algorithm, we calculated the electron density support for individual atoms (EDIAm) score.36 The EDIAm score quantiﬁes how well a group of atoms is supported by the electron density (Materials and Methods). EDIAm scores indicated that the qFit-ligand models improve agreement with the electron density in 63% of cases compared to a single conformer model (Figure 4D) and overall were within 0.2 of those of single conformer models. In cases where deposited models were well-supported by the electron density (EDIAm > ∼0.8), qFit-ligand models generally increased EDIAm compared to single conformer models, in some cases even improving the deposited model (Figure 4D,E, 3oik). Unsurprisingly, EDIAm scores correlated with the categories of conformational disorder; branched or displaced ligands had lower EDIAm scores. Nonetheless, even in those challenging cases, automated qFit-ligand multiconformers EDIAm scores are on par with those of single-conformer models while alerting to the presence of conformational heterogeneity (Figure 4E, right-hand panels; Supporting Information, Figure S15). We emphasize that Rfree and EDIAm values from fully automated modeling generally improve with manual reﬁnement.
To further evaluate the quality of qFit-ligand multiconformer models, we examined internal ligand energies, ignoring interactions with the receptor. Although qFit-ligand does not observe restraints in modeling, the quality of qFit-ligand multiconformer models as measured by their internal energy was excellent. We found a median conformationally averaged

excess energy of only 0.35 kcal/mol (Supporting Information, Figure S16, Table S2,), i.e., qFit-ligand multiconformer models were, on average, nearly indistinguishable from that of the rereﬁned single “A” conformation in our benchmark set. Interestingly, automatically building a qFit-ligand multiconformer model in some cases substantially reduced the ligand energy compared to the single “A” conformation. For example, for acyliminobenzimidazole inhibitor 36 in complex with human anaplastic lymphoma kinase,37 a series of concerted dihedral angle changes resulted in conformations that better ﬁt the density and reduced the energy by nearly 7 kcal/mol (Supporting Information, Figure S8). This suggests that a ligand can accumulate strain energy when it is forced into an averaged conformation to ﬁt the density. On the other hand, the distribution of ligand excess energies suggests that ligands also access higher energy conformations, within a few kcal/mol from the single conformation (Figure 4D). Indeed, ligands generally may not bind in the lowest energy conformation or even adopt a local minimum.38 Favorable noncovalent interactions with the receptor, buried hydrophobic surfaces, or desolvation of ordered waters in the binding pocket can overcome penalties of strained conformations.39,40 Thus, alternate conformations, even at elevated ligand energies, may reduce the free energy of the receptor−ligand complex.
qFit-ligand Discovers New Alternate Conformations in the D3R and the Twilight Databases. For prospective discovery, we ﬁrst applied qFit-ligand to the 145 crystal structures in the D3R data set, a high-quality collection of manually curated protein−ligand crystal structures ranging in resolution from 1.26 to 2.75 Å, designed for validation and improvement of methods in computer-aided drug design. Of the 10 crystal structures in the D3R data set with alternate ligand conformations, qFit-ligand recovered seven to within a median nRMSD of 0.24. Four of these overlap with our benchmark (PDB 4FV3, Figure 5A, and PDBs 4EK6, 4EK8, 4Y6D). We ranked all qFit-ligand multiconformer ligands using the Fisher z-transformation, a cross-correlation based metric which measures if alternate conformations are supported by the electron density (Materials and Methods). Three of the top

four ranked ligands already had a modeled alternate conformation, and six out of seven recovered multiconformer ligands ranked within the top 20, indicating that the Fisher-z transformation is an eﬀective ranking measure. A new alternate ligand conformation was uncovered by qFit-ligand in the crystal structure of the E166A mutant of Serratia fonticola carbapenemase (PDB 4EV4; new PDB 6DMH) from the D3R data set (Figure 5B). The terminal propanol functional group of a bound meropenem intermediate adopts a previously undetected conformation. Thus, qFit-ligand recovered 70% of ligand alternate conformations and even revealed a new alternate conformation in highly scrutinized experimental data (qFit-ligand multiconformer models of prospective cases can be found in Zenodo; DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1256262).
We also applied qFit-ligand to a subset of the Twilight data set. The Twilight data set represents ligand structures in the PDB poorly supported by the electron density map, potentially indicating conformational disorder in the map, or incorrectly modeled ligands. We applied qFit-ligand to ligands in the Twilight database with 15−36 non-hydrogen atoms, resolutions better than 2.0 Å, and a correlation coeﬃcient higher than 0.6, resulting in 2379 cases over 1168 PDB entries, which we ranked by Fisher z-score to identify “hits” of unmodeled, alternate conformations (Supporting Information, Table S3). We proceeded by manually inspecting the top 10% of cases.
In many cases, the electron density near the ligand was severely disordered, consistent with the intent of the Twilight database to ﬂag questionable models of ligands. While qFitligand suggested alternate conformations, their validity could not unambiguously be conﬁrmed using electron density measures. Nonetheless, in some instances, signiﬁcantly improved receptor−ligand interactions signiﬁed plausible alternate ligand conformations (Supporting Information, Figures S9, S10, S11).
However, for several crystal structures, qFit-ligand unambiguously detected alternate ligand binding conformations. For example, in the crystal structure of BACE-1, qFit-ligand ﬁnds three conformations (occupancies of 0.32/0.36/0.32) of inhibitor 5T5 (PDB 5EZX; new PDB 6DMI) (Figure 5C).

These conformations show the potential to engineer a ligand that can accommodate strong hydrogen bonding interactions to R189 and W137. In the single conformer model, one of the diﬂuoromethoxy ﬂuorines of the ligand and the amino group of R189 interact weakly through a 3.0 Å hydrogen bond.41 Our multiconformer model shows that the ligand can adopt a position where strong hydrogen bonding between these groups occur (i.e., shorter contact distances), although at the expense of sacriﬁcing a favorable hydrogen bonding interaction to W137. In addition, one of the qFit-ligand conformations turns a nonideal hydrogen bond geometry in the crystal structure between the diﬂuoromethoxy oxygen and amino group of W137 into an ideal geometry. Strikingly, the diﬂuoromethoxy group of BACE-1 inhibitor 5T6 (PDB 5EZZ) has a binding conformation that exploits this same hydrogen bonding interaction with W137 sampled by 5T5 at low occupancy (Figure 5D).42 These insights could be used to create a new ligand with branching substituents that can simultaneously form strong hydrogen bonding interactions with R189 and W137 in hopes of increasing binding aﬃnity.
qFit-ligand Identiﬁes Widespread Conformational Heterogeneity in BRD4 Ligand. In another notable example from the Twilight data set, qFit-ligand identiﬁed a minor, unmodeled population of inhibitor compound BDOIA383 bound to bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a BET (bromodomain and extra terminal domain) and BRD (Figure 6A, PDB 5CFW; new PDB 6DMJ). BRDs

are small, epigenetic “readers”, which recognize and bind histone acetylated lysine (AcK).43 BRDs can thereby epigeneti-
cally control gene transcription and have recently emerged as important drug targets.44 The human genome contains 61 BRDs, distributed over 46 diverse proteins.43 Several potent
small-molecule inhibitors for BRD4 have been structurally
characterized, but designing modulators selective between
BRD4 and CREB binding protein (CBP) has proved challenging.45−47
The BRD4-BDOIA383 example highlights how alternate
conformations can expose molecular surfaces away from the
primary recognition site that could be exploited for selectivity.
Inspection of the major population of BDOIA383 bound to
BRD4 revealed that it is stabilized by a crystal contact between
the BDOIA383 morpholine oxygen and the K91 carbonyl
(Figure 6A). By contrast, the minor conformation does not
engage in crystal contacts and buries nearly 6% more ligand solvent accessible surface area (3115 Å2) than the major conformation (3302 Å2) (Figure 6B). Additionally, the minor
conformation interacts with D145 at the N-terminus of helix δC (Figure 6A,B). Interestingly, compound BDOIA383 in
complex with CBP BRD revealed a rotation of the isoxazolebenzimidazole bond by 180°, exposing the phenethyl group to substituted R1173 at the δC N-terminus46 (PDB ID 5CGP),
occupying the space of the qFit-ligand minor morpholine conformation in BRD4. Subsequent ligand modiﬁcations

strengthened these interactions, leading to increasingly selective CBP modulators.
Flipped binding modes between BRD4 and CBP had been observed earlier with a bound isoxazolyl-benzimidazole ligand, also leading to improved selectivity.47 Strikingly, in this case too, qFit-ligand identiﬁed a minor conformation in the CBP complex structurally close to the BRD4 bound conformation (Figure 6C). Because selectivity is often achieved by leveraging unique structural ligand−receptor interactions, identifying alternate ligand conformations may help proﬁle auspicious ligand−receptor secondary molecular recognition sites.
Application of qFit-ligand to all 126 BRD2−4 crystal structures in the PDB (deposited in Zenodo; DOI: 10.5281/ zenodo.1256262) suggests that diﬀerential binding modes and ligand heterogeneity are remarkably ubiquitous (Materials and Methods). Visual inspection and manual curation revealed 12 new binding conformations detected with high conﬁdence (Supporting Information, Figure S12) and an additional 24 with possible alternate conformations (Supporting Information, Table S5, Figure S13). The alternate conformation detected by qFit-ligand in the crystal structure of BRD4 with ligand 9BM48 (phenyl ring ﬂip) is the same conformation observed in the crystal structure of BRD2 with ligand S5B,49 further supporting the idea that ligands can sample a second, minor pose which becomes dominant after small chemical modiﬁcations to their structure. These observations and the pervasiveness of ligand heterogeneity in BRDs suggest that the potential of alternate ligand conformations for structure-based drug design is signiﬁcantly undervalued.
■ DISCUSSION
Ligand conformational heterogeneity is widespread in X-ray data deposited in the PDB but underreported in the absence of automated and reliable computational methods. qFit-ligand is a new method to model a parsimonious multiconformer ligand in crystallographic electron densities. We formulated the challenge of identifying an ensemble that collectively best agrees with the electron density, from up to tens of thousands of candidate conformations, as a stepwise combinatorial optimization problem. qFit-ligand relies on exhaustive sampling, iteratively restrained by the electron density, to fully cover the conformational space of each ligand. Our method was designed to provide a measure of statistical conﬁdence for model selection in cases of ligand conformational heterogeneity, separating the contributions between harmonic displacement and multiple conformations.
We highlighted three examples of previously unmodeled alternate ligand conformations obtained from prospective application of qFit-ligand to the D3R and Twilight data sets (Supporting Information, Table S4 lists all prospective discoveries). Strikingly, even the highly curated D3R data set revealed a previously unmodeled alternate conformation. Targeted application to a single bromodomain receptor suggests that as many as 29% of receptor−ligand crystal structures could have alternate ligand conformations. This is a likely conservative estimate of the accessible ligand conformational landscape in protein crystal structures. The portrait of rigid receptors and ligands is exacerbated by the common practice of collecting X-ray crystallographic data at cryogenic temperature (100 K). Although cryocooling increases the precision of structure determination by reducing thermal motions, cooling aﬀects the conformational distribution of more than 35% of side chains in proteins50 and has been found

to alter ligand binding and abolish transient binding sites observed at room temperature.51 Applying qFit-ligand to room temperature X-ray crystallography data, which can shift the equilibrium of receptor−ligand conformational ensembles, may reveal additional minor ligand binding poses that are typically masked in cryogenic data.
qFit-ligand conformational strain energies after reﬁnement were nearly indistinguishable from those of the manually curated benchmark set, signifying that its multiconformer models are chemically accurate. Our analysis showed that qFitligand conformations were nearly isoenergetic. Less often we identiﬁed a ligand for which the qFit-ligand multiconformer model signiﬁcantly reduced strain energy, suggesting that conformational averaging of the single conformer model had led to a poorly modeled ligand to ﬁt the density. Changes in the free energy of the ligand−receptor complex will give a more complete picture of the eﬀect of multiconformer ligands but require a model of the receptor response to binding, which is beyond the scope of the current study. Ironically, multiconformer ligands are commonly ﬁltered out of major test sets for development of docking and conformational sampling approaches but may be a more “trustworthy” representation of the underlying data.52 Multiconformer ligand models can therefore address important challenges in ligand validation and deposition in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).53,54
Several aspects of qFit-ligand could be improved in the future. First and foremost, modeling the joint conformational ensemble of the binding site residues and ligand will be a major step forward toward a better understanding of receptor response to ligand binding. The potential of this approach is underlined by our ﬁnding that 12% of structures in the Twilight data set already present alternate receptor conformations within 5 Å of the ligand. While ultimately an accurate thermodynamic distribution for receptor−ligand conformations is desired, our approach determines a parsimonious ensemble of conformations that is supported by the data alone. These conformations can provide a starting point for MD simulation to obtain a better estimation for a thermodynamic distribution. Second, while in principle our conformational sampling approach could be combined with a sophisticated force ﬁeld,55 relying on energy restraints in the discovery stage can result in increased computational cost and can risk excluding promising candidate conformations owing to imperfect sampling and steep potential energy gradients. Rather, we advocate including energy restraints in reﬁnement.31 Other conformational search methods with force ﬁelds, such as Schrodinger’s ConfGen56 and MacroModel,57 OpenEye’s Omega,58 MOE,59 and many other freely available tools,60 could independently validate results in the absence of data.
Third, the false-positive rates can likely be decreased. Several techniques are available to guard against overﬁtting. For example, the BIC criteria weighs increased model complexity (number of conformations) to a better statistical ﬁt. Terminal ends and ring ﬂips had low false positive rates, whereas those for the branched and displaced categories were elevated. qFitligand recovered terminal end and ring ﬂips to within an nRMSD of 0.27. Disordered parts of branched ligands were often solvent-exposed and therefore more diﬃcult to recover. Accounting for partial occupancy of ligand, receptor conformers, and solvent will be required to reveal details at the solvent interface. Displaced ligands are not “anchored” in the binding pocket and are among the most challenging to recover.

An nRMSD of 0.5 or below often suﬃced for further reﬁnement, but even nRMSDs up to 0.75 sometimes required
only minor manual adjustments, depending on the absolute RMSD between states. For example, ring ﬂips involving
rotationally symmetric atom species cannot be uniquely
assigned based on the electron density alone, leading to inﬂated RMSD measures, which are easily adjusted (Support-
ing Information, Materials and Methods, PDB 3P4V). All
benchmark qFit-ligand results were obtained with the same parameters. In practice, speciﬁc problems will dictate tailored settings. For example, selecting ﬁner sampling steps or larger
volumes for rigid body searches could give better results at the
expense of increased computational time (Supporting In-
formation, Figure S17). Nonetheless, on our benchmark set,
the fully automated qFit-ligand multiconformer models were supported by real-space validation measures, and their Rfree values were statistically indistinguishable from the manually
curated set. While these measures cannot perfectly distinguish false positives, structural models consistent with the reﬂection
data create a pool of testable hypothesis, which can be
evaluated in drug discovery using ligand structure activity
relationships or protein residue mutations. Fourth, the partial occupancy of an “unbound”/apo state
could be explicitly considered. Weak, overlapping densities
originating from partially occupied receptor and ligand conformations in the binding pocket are often diﬃcult to
tease apart, owing to a vast number of possible ligand
conformations to be evaluated, even in sterically constrained
binding cavities. Partially occupied water molecules and
crystallographic additives often further confound modeling eﬀorts. In these challenging cases, diﬀerence densities from
alternate states are often incorrectly resolved by waters. Promising new approaches such as PanDDa61 can reveal the
electron density of partially occupied states; however, it requires a large number of “ground state” crystal structures to
reliably compute their contribution to the partially occupied
state. Our method is highly complementary, and PanDDa
maps could even be used as input to qFit-ligand. Synergy of these approaches holds the promise to enable eﬃcient,
accurate, and unbiased discovery of alternate fragment and ligand binding poses. This is increasingly important in view of
the ability to structurally screen hundreds of candidate ligands
within hours on modern synchrotrons. The combination of these methods may help remove temptation to ﬁll all diﬀerence
density with waters while avoiding the overly optimiztic
modeling of partial occupancy ligands that are highlighted by
the Twilight Database. Even with these improvements, it is important to be
sensitive to concerns of overﬁtting when ﬁtting additional
conformations into electron density maps. We have guarded
against this possibility in multiple ways: (1) we identify conformations similar to “expert” manual modeling in
experimental test sets, (2) in synthetic data sets, the Fisher z score identiﬁes a statistically signiﬁcant parsimonious set that correspond in number to the underlying “true” number of conformations, and (3) traditional global metrics (Rfree) and new local metrics (EDIA) do not identify major concerns.
Furthermore, on the prospective set (1), new interactions are identiﬁed that make biochemical sense, (2) we identiﬁed similar conformations in ligands that diﬀer by only a few atoms, and (3) visual inspection conﬁrms that Fo − Fc diﬀerence density is reduced. This last point underscores
how visual inspection is important for eliminating false

positives and, as shown here, for manually improving the ﬁt.
Furthermore, these checks are especially important for
verifying the correct stereochemistry. Ultimately, biochemical tests with mutations or altered ligands are the best forward
validation. Finally, as the particle size and resolution limitations of
single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) continue to
improve, that technology will have a major impact on drug discovery.62 High-throughput and automation approaches,63 combined with the size of the complexes in cryo-EM structure
determination, will soon turn careful modeling of protein and
ligand structural heterogeneity into a major bottleneck. qFitligand can provide an eﬃcient, automated modeling approach at the amino acid length scale, as EM maps are immutable during modeling and reﬁnement. Beyond applications to drug
discovery, as time-resolved serial crystallography is rapidly
becoming routine at X-ray free electron lasers and even synchrotrons,64 qFit-ligand can help resolve minor populations of structural protein−ligand intermediates in light-driven pump−probe65 or structural enzymology “mix-and-inject” experiments.66,67
■ CONCLUSIONS
Revealing the full receptor−ligand conformational ensemble
can help drug design by exploiting the balance between entropy and enthalpy in compound design68,69 and by characterizing the eﬀect of prerigidifying ligands on aﬃnity.70
Equally important, it can help the rational design of ligand
selectivity by exposing accessible molecular surfaces unique to their intended targets.71 In the future, full integration of qFitligand with qFit could reveal the structural reorganization of
binding pockets and allosteric signal propagation in the receptor upon ligand binding.21,72 Our qFit-ligand open source
software, available from https://github.com/ExcitedStates/ qﬁt_ligand, provides promising, new starting points for ligand
optimization and structure-based drug discovery. However,
communication between structural biologists, computational
chemists, and medicinal chemists remains a requisite for successful, rational design.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS Survey of the Protein Data Bank and benchmark creation. All structure coordinate ﬁles were downloaded from the PDB. Structures determined by X-ray crystallography were checked for HETATM entries (ligands) containing at least two diﬀerent altloc identiﬁers with identical chemical composition. We aim to characterize conformational heterogeneity of ligands that are (1) drug-like and (2) have multiple internal degrees of freedom. Ligands with fewer than 15 non-hydrogen atoms were therefore discarded as were covalently linked ligands. This resulted in a list of 2611 ligands divided over 1845 PDB ﬁles. The list was further pruned to exclude ligand ﬂips, i.e., alternate conformations that do not have a common cluster of atoms in space, and alternate conformations consisting exclusively of ring puckers as our algorithm was not designed to sample these types of conformational changes. We then selected receptors and ligands of pharmaceutical interest, resulting in a ﬁnal benchmark set of 90 cases that reﬁned against the deposited structure factors and CIF ﬁles. As the quality of X-ray data aﬀects model building and reﬁnement, we veriﬁed that low-resolution X-ray data cutoﬀ and data completeness were within acceptable ranges (Supporting Information, Table S1). Each case was rereﬁned using phenix.reﬁne v1.11 with the following parameters

Single conformer ligand models were created by removing the ligand’s “B” conformation from the original deposited PDB model and resetting the occupancy of the “A” conformation to 1. The single conformer models were re-reﬁned as above.
The qFit-ligand Approach. The qFit-ligand algorithm takes as input the initial structure of a reﬁned single conformer ligand modeled in the electron density, a real-space map (2mFo − DFc) in ccp4 format and its resolution and, optionally, the receptor and other ligand and solvent atoms for clash avoidance. The qFit-ligand algorithm starts by scaling the map electron density values to approximate absolute scale, using only the density under the footprint of the receptor. Next, the algorithm calculates an Fc map corresponding to the receptor and any other atoms in the crystal not part of the ligand. This map is subtracted from the experimental density. Map values below the mean are set to zero to prevent building into spurious density. We call the resulting map the target map.
Next, qFit-ligand determines rotatable covalent bonds of the ligand and rigid groups of atoms. Covalent bonds are determined based on proximity; i.e., if the distance between two atoms is smaller than their combined covalent radius plus 0.5 Å, the atoms are considered covalently bonded. It partitions the ligand into rigid groups of atoms (i.e., groups of atoms without internal DoFs) as follows: It constructs a graph G = (Vm,Em) such that the vertices Vm represent atoms, and edges Em represent covalent bonds. Next, members of Em that (1) are in a ring system, and (2) edges (u,v) in Em where u or v has degree one are edge-contracted. Hybridization states (partial double bonds) are ignored in the current implementation. A covalent bond is rotatable if it is not part of the same ring system. After edge contraction, each edge Em ultimately corresponds to a rotating bond (one degree of freedom) and each vertex Vm corresponds to a collection of atoms that form a rigid body. Thus, rigid groups of atoms do not have internal, rotatable covalent bonds (Supporting Information, Figure S2).
Analogous to existing crystallographic model building procedures,73 qFit-ligand iteratively generates and ranks a large number of candidate ensembles by scoring against the electron density and retaining a small ensemble (Figure 3A and Supporting Information, Figure S2). It uses modern statistical routines for subset selection in regression models by MIQP.74,75 qFit-ligand builds up candidate ligand conformers starting from each rigid group of atoms in turn, similar to the approach implemented in FlexX/S76 (Supporting Information, Figure S2). To prevent a combinatorial explosion, qFit-ligand iteratively samples and selects candidate conformers for successive rigid groups. The ﬁrst sampling iteration consists of a local rigid body search of the starting group within a box with an edge size of 0.4 Å at a 0.1 Å interval and 10 randomly generated orientations at a maximum rotation angle of 10° (1250 conformations). An MIQP step (details below) selects up to ﬁve occupancy-weighted candidate positions that, collectively, minimize the real-space density residual of the rigid group. For each selected conformation, subsequent iterations each sample N (user-deﬁned, default 2) torsion angles with a userdeﬁned (default 6°) step size to add N successive rigid groups simultaneously. Clash detection is divided into internal clashes, i.e., clashes within a single ligand conformer, and external clashes, i.e., clashes between a ligand conformer and the receptor. Clashing conformations, both internal and with the receptor (using an eﬃcient, O(1), spatial hashing algorithm), are detected and removed from the set before selection with MIQP. Bond lengths and angles are kept ﬁxed during the whole procedure.
After each sampling iteration, the optimal occupancies of generated conformations are determined as follows. Each conformation is transformed into a density given by
∫ ρ(r) = 8/r smax f (s) exp(−Bs2) sin(4πrs)s ds smin

where r is the position compared to the atom position, f(s) is the atomic scattering factor as a function of the momentum vector of the atom, B is the isotropic B-factor, and smin and smax are the minimum and maximum momentum vector length. For computational eﬃciency, a lookup table is created for each atom at an interval of 0.01 Å.
A combined mask is calculated by forming the union of all individual conformation masks, using a resolution dependent radius, where r = 0.5 + R/3. Density values under the footprint of the resulting mask are extracted and used as input for Quadratic Programming (QP) and Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) to select up to ﬁve conformations that best represent the density data locally. QP and MIQP solvers guarantee the global optimal occupancy of each conformation by minimizing the real-space residual given by

(1)

where ρo is the target map, ρi is the calculated density of conformer i, wi is the weight, or occupancy, of conformer i, and 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 is a threshold on the occupancy. If t = 0, the constraints enforce nonnegativity for the occupancies, and the program is a QP. The combined occupancy cannot exceed unity. Selecting t > 0 introduces sparsity or threshold constraints, which turns the program (1) into a MIQP. To reduce computational complexity, relevant conformations are preselected using QP and used as input for a subsequent round of MIQP.23
After the ligand has been fully built up starting from each cluster, all resulting conformations are pooled together for a ﬁnal round of rescoring. The individual Pearson product-moment cross-correlation (RSCC) is calculated for each individual conformation. Conformations with RSCC score less than 0.9 times the highest correlation, and redundant conformations for which all pairwise atom distances are within those of previously accepted conformations, are discarded. Finally, a parsimonious multiconformer model is created as follows. An MIQP step at an occupancy threshold of 0.20 is performed on the remaining pool of conformations. Visual inspection of conformers at minimum occupancy of 0.2 generally indicated density contours exceeded noise levels.77 For very high resolution data sets, this threshold can be reduced. The resulting selected conformations are ranked by RSCC value, and starting from the conformation carrying the highest RSCC, additional conformations are added if the RSCC increases under the combined footprint and else discarded. This is performed iteratively until self-consistent, i.e., all conformations increase the RSCC under the combined footprint. The output of qFitligand consists of all conformations before the ﬁnal rescoring round and the sparse, occupancy-weighted multiconformer ligand model.
qFit-ligand is implemented in Python 2.7 and relies on the opensource NumPy, SciPy, and CVXOPT78 packages and the freely available Community Edition of IBM ILOG CPLEX, with added modules from the mmLib Python toolkit.79 qFit-ligand is released under the MIT license and can be downloaded free of charge from https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qﬁt_ligand, where additional documentation and installation instructions can be found.
Benchmarking qFit-ligand. Simulated structure factors were generated from the rereﬁned benchmark set using phenix.fmodel at 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, 2.0, and 2.5 Å resolution. Occupancy of the B-conformer was varied from 0.5 to 0.0 occupancy in 0.1 decrements, requiring that the combined occupancy of the multiconformer ligand summed up to unity. A random error of 10% was added to the amplitudes, a fraction of 0.1 was used for Rfree ﬂags, and we selected ksol = 0.4 and bsol = 45 Å2. The B-factor of each ligand atom was adjusted by 10 times the diﬀerence in real and simulated resolution, i.e., the B-factor was inﬂated for lower resolution simulated data and sharpened for high resolution data. The resulting mtz ﬁles were converted into ccp4 density ﬁles using phenix.mtz2map.

For each resolution and occupancy combination, qFit-ligand was run on the full benchmark set using diﬀerent sampling parameters: sampling 1 degree of freedom (DoF) using a torsion sampling interval of 1 degree, and sampling 2 DoFs simultaneously using a torsion sampling interval of 6 degrees. To obtain a uniform metric for evaluating the performance of qFit-ligand, we therefore analyzed the results by calculating a normalized RMSD, calculated in the receptor frame of reference:80,81

RMSD(B, RMSD(A ,

between the output structures Ci of qFit-ligand and the ligand B conformer used during the structure factor generation, normalized by the RMSD between the A and B conformer. Conformers Ci for which nRMSD < 0.5 are more similar to the B conformer than the A conformer. The nRMSD measure puts equal weight on each benchmark case by normalization while providing uniform thresholds for determining success (Figure S14). We note that the RMSD (and therefore also the nRMSD) measure has important limitations, aﬀecting the results. For example, because RMSD is typically calculated between unique points, it fails to account for symmetric transformations within a ligand, e.g., a 180° ﬂipped acidic group or aromatic ring, thus introducing additional error. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is no readily available method that addresses this issue. While a low nRMSD guarantees a good solution, a relatively high nRMSD can still suggest an alternate conformation that requires some manual adjustments, including symmetric transformations.
We subsequently evaluated the performance of qFit-ligand for each category in the benchmark set, at simulated resolutions and occupancies, after reﬁnement with PHENIX v1.11 using the same protocol as stated above for rereﬁnement. The ﬁnal selection stage was optimized heuristically by ﬁnding a balance between maximizing sensitivity and minimizing false-positives against the benchmark.
D3R and Twilight Database Investigation. We downloaded the D3R (https://drugdesigndata.org/about/datasets) and Twilight (http://www.ruppweb.org/twilight/newligands-2016.tsv.bz2) databases deposited in 2016. For all cases, structure coordinates and 2mFo − DFc maps were downloaded from the PDB. For the Twilight cases, we discarded structures with a reported resolution worse than 2.0 Å and ligands consisting of less than 15 and more than 35 nonhydrogen atoms and a cross-correlation score less than 0.6. The resulting qFit-ligand multiconformer models were ranked on the Fisher z-transformation score. The Fisher z-transformation is a mapping of the RSCC r so that its distribution is approximately normal. It was previously applied to signiﬁcance testing for cryo-EM rigid body ﬁtting82−84 and is given by

where N represents the number of independent observations, approximated by N = MV/(c × R), where MV represents the molecular volume of the ligand in Å3, R the resolution in Å, and c = 1 Å2, a constant.83 Starting with the conformer with the highest RSCC,
additional conformations are added. Our approach is based on
hypothesis testing of the normally distributed, random variable. For
each additional conformer, the z-score is recalculated for both the
starting conformation and the combined multiconformer under the footprint of the latter. The resulting diﬀerence in z-score is divided by
its standard error to provide a resolution and size corrected measure of signiﬁcance for the increase in cross-correlation, where higher is

Ligand Energy. To assess ligand conformational energies, we carried out constrained minimizations (ﬂat bottom width of 0.2 Å) of all ligands (from single conformer and qFit-ligand multiconformer models) using Jaguar85 with the M06-2X functional86,87 and 631G(d,p) basis set, except for bromine atoms, which used the LAV2P basis set. Gas-phase energies of ligand conformations generated by qFit-ligand (which were subsequently reﬁned) were compared to ligand conformations in the single conformer model (i.e., 0 kcal/mol). The relative energies of each alternative conformation in the qFitligand multiconformer model were multiplied by their respective occupancies, then summed to arrive at the occupancy-weighted ligand energy.
